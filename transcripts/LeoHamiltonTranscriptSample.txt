This is Mary Hebert. Today is August twenty-first, 1993, and I am going to be talking to Leo Hamilton.

00:14.140 --> 00:26.826
And we're at Hill Memorial Library on LSU's campus. Okay, first we're going to start out just me asking you just a few questions about your background, and then we'll stop the machine and make sure that the sound quality is okay.

00:26.826 --> 00:30.723
LEO HAMILTON: Okay.
HEBERT: Okay, first, I'd like for you to just tell me your first name.

00:30.723 --> 00:34.929
HAMILTON: Leo.
HEBERT: Your full name. Your full name, excuse me.
HAMILTON: My full name, Leo Charles Hamilton.

00:34.929 --> 00:41.100
HEBERT: [00:35] And when and where were you born?
HAMILTON: June twenty-third, 1951, in Baton Rouge.

00:41.100 --> 00:48.408
HEBERT: And what was your father's name?
HAMILTON: Leo Hamilton.
HEBERT: So you're Leo Hamilton, Junior?
HAMILTON: No. I'm Leo Charles.

00:48.408 --> 01:05.663
My . . . I'm the second of six kids, and my mother thought if there was to be a junior, it should be the first. And she has eight sisters and one brother, and her brother's name is Charles. So, I'm Leo Charles. HEBERT: So you're Leo Charles.

01:05.663 --> 01:11.555
HAMILTON: Right.
HEBERT: And what about . . . what was your mother's first and maiden name?
HAMILTON: Myrtle Franklin.

01:11.555 --> 01:21.156
HEBERT: What did your father do for a living?

01:21.156 --> 01:26.939
HAMILTON: [01:22] He was a machinist. Well, yeah, he's retired now. He was a machinist with Holsum Bakery here in Baton Rouge.

01:26.939 --> 01:47.147
HEBERT: Did your mother work?
HAMILTON: Off and on. She worked as a domestic, really, for most of my life, and then she did . . . Well, she was . . . all her life she wanted to be a nurse and did not get the opportunity to go to school to do so.

01:47.147 --> 02:06.065
And actually, I guess it must have been in about 1971, she decided to go to one of these schools, small business colleges around town, and now she's a nurse?s aide.

02:06.065 --> 02:14.083
She just decided it was time to do something about it, and so she's a nurse?s aide. She does home health care.

02:14.083 --> 02:21.078
HEBERT: Did she not have the opportunity to go to college or to go to a nursing school? Was that . . .

02:21.078 --> 02:32.897
HAMILTON: [02:20] Well, no. What happened was, she got married I guess, gosh, right after my dad got out of the service and had children and at the time, could not afford it.

02:32.897 --> 02:42.371
There really weren't a whole bunch of opportunities available, and, as I mentioned earlier, there are six of us. So, with six kids, she just didn't have the time. HEBERT: That's true.

02:42.371 --> 03:08.100
HAMILTON: And at about '71, and I say '71 or '72, I can't remember exactly, but the three boys are a year apart. All of us attended LSU and my brother Gregory was in his second year here in '71 and that was the time at which she decided, my sisters are younger than us and she
just felt she had the time

03:08.100 --> 03:18.366
so she went to school part time, got her . . . I remember helping her, that's how I can remember we were in school, and I remember helping her study.

03:18.366 --> 03:23.210
So at that time, she got her degree, and now, she's a nurse's aide.

03:23.210 --> 03:28.786
HEBERT: [03:24] What was their level of education, your parents?
HAMILTON: High school.
HEBERT: High school.
HAMILTON: They both finished high school.
