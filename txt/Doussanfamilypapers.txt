Antoine Doussan to Auguste Doussan, 1827 Dec. 5	Doussan, Antoine J.	1827-12-05	1 letter.	Baton Rouge, December 5, 1827, Antoine Doussan to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Rue du Foin St. Jacques, Paris.  Antoine advises Auguste not to dwell on botany to the exclusion of the sciences of healing and to study botany as a doctor, not a naturalist.  The same applies to physics, math, and chemistry.  Auguste needs to focus on clinical lectures.  Antoine imagines Auguste will be taking anatomy and physiology.  'Faymoreau' and 'Dr. Donadier' are mentioned in a marginal note.  Antoine has given Faymoreau a rattlesnake tail and tooth.  Antoine is too far away to direct Auguste's studies, so he suggests that Auguste attach himself to a professor who can advise him.  Antoine is angry over the absence of a professorial chair for such advising.  Antoine instructs Auguste to receive Faymoreau well, and the latter can tell Auguste more about Antoine.  Antoine wants Auguste and Faymoreau to get him a Lamark botany (or any botany that might be better) as well as a microscope for botany.  Antoine has authorized Maison [Peltier?] to augment Auguste's monthly allowance.  Antoine admonishes Auguste to buy only those books necessary for his studies.  Antoine describes his personal library.  In a postscript, the writer adds, 'Ta belle-soeur t'envoie par Faymoreau dix piastres pour tes étrennes du jour de l'an.'	Antoine Doussan, Baton Rouge, to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Rue du Foin St. Jacques, Paris. The Doussans were an émigré French family who came to Louisiana in the wake of Napoleon's downfall.  The patriarch, Antoine, a medical doctor and former soldier under Napoleon, managed the family's cotton and sugar plantation in West Baton Rouge Parish as well as French-resident members' financial affairs in Louisiana.  Auguste Doussan was the younger brother of Antoine Doussan.  He practiced medicine in Grasse, France, and married Louise Perrin, who was a relative of the Allain family of Louisiana. Antoine Doussan writes to advise Auguste Doussan on his education. He suggests that Auguste attach himself to a professor who can advise him, mentioning 'Faymoreau' and 'Dr. Donadier', and instructs him to obtain a microscope and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's work on botany. He also writes that he has authorized Maison [Peltier?] to augment Auguste's monthly allowance and admonishes Auguste to buy only those books necessary for his studies. Antoine also describes his personal library.	French.	Text.

De Rabars had received a letter from Auguste's brother dated June 14, Baton Rouge.  Auguste's brother's wife has been ill since her mother's death.  Brother and wife are going to spend six months in a climate better than Louisiana's, coming to France next summer if her health permits.  Auguste's brother wants Auguste and De Rabars to be in contact with each other.  De Rabars says he served in the military with Auguste's brother, who cared for De Rabars after the latter was gravely wounded in the right shoulder at the end of the last campaign in Italy in 1813.  They have not seen much of each other since the events of 1814 other than during Doussan's last trip to France, the memories of which De Rabars' family still cherish.  De Rabars works for customs at Bordeaux, where he has been with his wife and two children for a year.  His son is 12 and in a 'collège.'  His daughter is 10 and is receiving her education at her mother's side.  	Charles de Rabars, Bordeaux, to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Paris.  Charles de Rabars, a resident of the Bordeaux region of France, served in Napoleon's army with Antoine Doussan.

He practiced medicine in Grasse, France, and married Louise Perrin, who was a relative of the Allain family of Louisiana. De Rabars relates news received in a letter from Antoine Doussan, Auguste's brother, including the illness of Antoine's wife, their plans to come to France next summer if her health permits, and Antoine's desire for de Rabars and Auguste to be in touch. De Rabars also writes of his military service with Antoine, who cared for De Rabars after the latter was gravely wounded at the end of the last campaign in Italy in 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars. He also describes his work for customs at Bordeaux and his children's education. 	French.	Text.

Charles the younger has run up many expenses.  He had committed 'folies' in his regiment at Lyons (which is why he had been sent to Africa).  Charles the elder is greatly humiliated and wants Auguste to take the son into Auguste's home for a while.  Charles the elder's wife is suffering from all of this as well, but their daughter, Mathilde, is their consolation.  De Rabars lists Mathilde's good qualities.  The writer relates that he was 40 when he made Auguste's acquaintance, and now he is 50.	Mailed from Libourne. Charles de Rabars to Auguste Doussan in Grasse.
