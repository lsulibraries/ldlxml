The monuments seen are those of the 18th U.S. Regulars (the one with the soldier in the act of firing) and the other that of the 15th U.S. Regulars.

Numerous Federal monuments mark the line. These works formed the left of Thomas' entrenchments. In charging here, the Louisiana Brigade stood facing southwest, and about 1000 yards east of the farthest point it had reached, in the morning, in its onslaught from the McDonald fields. After carrying the works, it pressed on across the Kelly fields, almost at right angles to its direction in the morning charge; and crossing the Chattanooga road, halted on the ground where it had then been repulsed, and found the dead and wounded it had left behind.<br>The white stake marks the center of the Brigade; the marked tree is about the spot where Capt.

The enemy were driven from them into the woods by Adams' Louisiana Brigade at 10 a.m. on September, 1863. The brigade, with Slocomb's battery, crossed from the east side of the road, driving Beattie's Federal Brigadebefore it. It then changed front perpendicular to, and resting on the road, and charged into the woods of the south. In these fields the brigade was rallied and reformed when driven back.  Slocomb's Battery, (5th Company Washington Artillery,) took several positions in these fields. First, about 200 yards west of the road, firing at Beattie's Brigade retreating in that direction; secondly, facing Northwest firing at the enemy around Cloud's House; thirdly, from a position facing South across the hollow that runs East and West through the fields (the position in the cornfield shown in View No. 9); fourthly, from a position across the hollow in rear and north of the third position, in which position the battery cheked and drove back the enemy pursuing Adams' Louisiana Brigade, when it was driven from the woods on the South. About midday of the 20th September, the First Louisiana Regulars consolidated with the Eighth Arkansas in Govan's Brigade, entered these fields from the East side of the road also, after the repulse of Adams' Brigade to whose support they were brought up. They came in at the same point, the McDonald house, changed front to the left perpendicular to the road, advanced over the same ground that Adams' Brigade had gone over, and passing Slocomb's Battery, then engaged in its fourth position, entered the woods south of the fields, driving the enemy back, almost to the point, Adams had reached in Thomas' rear. From there, Govan's Brigade was also driven back, and the First Louisiana and Eighth Arkansas consolidated, made their way out of the woods south, and back into the fields, by a wide detour to the right; and retreated to the woods to the east side of the road from where they had crossed.

View No. 17. Chickamauga. Adams' Louisiana Brigade.	Done	unknown	ca. 1894		Chickamauga (Ga.), Battle of, 1863; Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park (Ga. and Tenn.)--Photographs	This view is looking South at the part of Thomas' breastworks carried by the Louisiana Brigade at 5:50 p.m., September 20th, 1863. The works were held by J.H. King's Brigade of regulars. The monuments seen are those of the 18th U.S. Regulars (the one with the soldier in the act of firing) and the other that of the 15th U.S. Regulars. The logs lying before them mark the place of the breastworks. This point is an angle of the works that extend off to the left following the contour of Kelly's fields that are seen through the woods. Numerous Federal monuments mark the line. These works formed the left of Thomas' entrenchments. In charging here, the Louisiana Brigade stood facing southwest, and about 1000 yards east of the farthest point it had reached, in the morning, in its onslaught from the McDonald fields. After carrying the works, it pressed on across the Kelly fields, almost at right angles to its direction in the morning charge; and crossing the Chattanooga road, halted on the ground where it had then been repulsed, and found the dead and wounded it had left behind. The white stake marks the center of the Brigade; the marked tree is about the spot where Capt. C. H. Luzenberg, of the 13th and 20th Louisiana was shot down within twenty steps of the breastworks. This position was fixed by the Louisiana and the National Commissioners on the 25th of September, 1893, and marked by W. A. Wood of the Engineer Department of the National Commission, and figures in his notes as Adams' Brigade at 5:50, September 20th, 1863, Line No. 30-15 ft. N-0x78.

This position is about three-quarters of a mile from the crest of the ridge. Here, on the evening of the 25th of November, 1863 Capt. Slocomb, of the 5th Company Washington Artillery, coming from the ridge after the loss of his guns, found some guns abandoned, which had been gotten to this point from the ridge. Manning them with his cannoneers, the Louisiana Brigade, at his call and at that of Major Austin and other officers, rallied around the guns, and the first stand was made here. The enemy was checked, and after a determined onslaught, was kept at bay until the broken remnants of Bragg's left wing had crossed the Chickamauga over the pontoon bridge on this road. This position was fixed and marked by the Louisiana Commissioners September 26th, 1894.	Image	Gelatin silver prints;8.5" x 5.2"	jpeg	Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park (Ga. and Tenn.)

Done	unknown	ca. 1894		Chickamauga (Ga.), Battle of, 1863; Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park (Ga. and Tenn.)--Photographs	This view shows the position where this consolidated regiment with Govan's Brigade captured and carried off Van Pelt's 1st Michigan Battery, at about 12:30 p.m., on the 19th of September, 1863. The white speck in the center of the field shows the stake marking the center of the Battery's line.

The stake is about three-fourths of a mile south-west of Jay's mill, and about five hundred yards North of the direct road from Brotherton's to that mill. In the view, the pyramid seen near the right hand edge, is one of cannon balls marking the place where fell the Federal General P. P. Baldwin. The white monument in the left hand side of the field, marks the spot where stood Battery H., U. S. Regulars, that was captured by Walthall's Brigade and re-taken by the Federals. This position was fixed by the Louisiana and National Commissioners, General Walthal and Major Govan being present, on September 25th, 1893, and marked by W. A.

Here, this Battalion lost very heavily in officers and men, and was driven back with its Brigade.

The view is facing South, the country is thickly wooded with gentle swells, at the position is a flat plateau, somewhat rocky, and with less forest growth on that account, than the surrounding land. This position was fixed on September 25th, 1894, by the Louisiana and National Commissioners with the assistance of J. F. Dicks, of Natchez, who was in the battle with the Battalion. It was marked by W. A. Wood, of the Engineer Department of the National Commission, and figures in the field notes as Fourth Louisiana Battalion, Line 48-E-69. N. 57x38.

The point is on the west bank of the Chickamauga, about 150 yards from the bank, and Glass' Mill. The enemy was posted on the cleared elevation seen on the left in View No. 22. Lookout Mountain is seen in the distance. This was altogether an artillery fight. The house seen in the left hand corner was standing during the battle, and still shows marks of cannon balls. In this field the Washington Artillery had six men and one officer killed and five men wounded. Cobb's Kentucky Battery was here engaged at the same time; it stood to the right of Slocomb's Battery in the woods across the road shown by the fence. Pieces of shell and many flint arrow heads, were picked up in this field by the Commissioners. This position was fixed and marked by the Louisiana and National Commissioners, and noted by E. E. Wood of the engineer department of the National Commission, but being outside of the Military Park lands, it is not noted with relation to the Park surveys.

Yes	unknown	ca. 1894		Chickamauga (Ga.), Battle of, 1863;<br>Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park (Ga. and Tenn.)--Photographs	The view shows the bank of the Chickamauga at Red house crossing. The river is hidden by the forest growth which fringes it very heavily. The crossing is no longer a public highway and is reached through cultivated fields on both banks. This is the western bank. This crossing derived its name from a red house near it, which has been constructed by the Indians, and was torn down by the federals to make a bridge of at the crossing.<br>A great deal of fighting occurred on both sides of the river at this point during the 18th, 19th and 20th September.
