Elks' Theater building, corner of Third and Florida Streets, showing the stage set for 'The Christian.'	Baton Rouge	Lytle, Andrew David, 1834-1917.	1900	Photograph : glass plate negative / polyester interpositive	'During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, before radio, motion pictures, and television, a community's social life involved a diverse array of events. Lytle often photographed these events, providing us a record of the richness of that life. What follows is a sampling of those Lytle Studio images. The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks had the Elks' Theater building constructed in 1900. The three-story structure contained a theater, lodge hall, and office and retail space. During the theater's grand opening, November 17, 1900, the Elks staged Hall Craine's drama 'The Christian.' This image of the theater's drop curtain was published in 1901 in the 'Elks Souvenir of Baton Rouge.''   Mark E. Martin, in 'Andrew D.

Forest scene documenting size of base of tree	Logging	Lytle, Andrew David, 1834-1917.	1895?-1905?	Photograph : albumen print	'Late in the nineteenth century, northern logging and lumber interests turned their attention to resources in the South. In Louisiana, longleaf pine, hardwoods and cypress were particularly plentiful and attractive to these interests. Photography, combined with the new halftone printing process, was used extensively to advertise the richness of the timberlands. The man and child in this image are dwarfed by the tree they stand against. Loggers could use just such an image to provide a rough estimate of the board feet of finished lumber that could be produced from this tree.'  Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D.

View of Baton Rouge's Front Street from the Mississippi River.  The Capitol may be seen on the right.	Civil War	Lytle, Andrew David, 1834-1917.	1861?	Photograph : albumen print	'Andrew and Mary Lytle arrived in Baton Rouge around 1858 to begin a nearly sixty-year residency. They found themselves in a town with a free and slave population of nearly 6,500, a state whose economy largely depended on slavery, and a region on the verge of succeeding from the Union. Over the course of the next two years the U.S. Army garrison in town would change hands twice, Baton Rouge would become occupied territory, and over one-third of the town would be burned to the ground. During the war years, Andrew would photograph thousands of Federal soldiers and sailors in his studio. He would take his cameras into town to photograph army encampments and individuals. Andrew even went aboard naval ships moored in the river to photograph their crews. Fifty years after the war, his war photographs would help create his lasting claim to fame. Lytle may have been set up in a boat in the Mississippi River to get this panoramic image of Baton Rouge's waterfront, ca. 1860. This image covers the waterfront from Main Street to North Boulevard. The State Capitol may be seen on the far right' – Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D. Lytle's Baton Rouge: photographs 1863-1910, (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 2008), p. 1.

Pelican Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 with decorated ladder wagon.	Firemen	Lytle, Andrew David, 1834-1917.	1885?-1905?	Photograph : albumen print	'Baton Rouge buildings in the nineteenth century were constructed of wood, making fire a constant threat capable of destroying large parts of the town. Beginning in the 1870s, a number of fire-fighting companies were organized. These companies raised money for equipment, trained as fire fighters, and generally proved more effective than the old method of issuing a general alarm to the populace. The fire companies also served as a type of fraternal organization with dress uniforms, regular meetings, auxiliary members, and fund-raising events. They also organized one of the most popular annual events in Baton Rouge- the Washingtons Birthday Firemens Parade. In Baton Rouge, this annual event, rather than Mardi Gras, capped the winter social season. The Pelican Hook and Ladder Company in full dress uniform with their ladder wagon, ca. 1900' – Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D. Lytle's Baton Rouge: photographs 1863-1910, (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 2008), p. 59.

The cast iron fence surrounding the  Louisiana Capitol.	Baton Rouge	Lytle, Andrew David, 1834-1917.	1891? - 1910?	Photograph : albumen print	'The original Capitol building in Baton Rouge was designed and built by James Harrison Dakin in 1850. During the Civil War, Federal forces looted the building and used it as a hospital until a runaway flue fire gutted the interior in late December 1862. The Capitol stood empty until 1882, when architect William A. Freret finished his reconstruction. This image of a man standing in front of the cast-iron fence surrounding the State Capitol was taken from the corner of North Boulevard and St. Philip Street, ca. 1895' – Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D.

Photograph : gelatin silver print	'Hauling cotton seed  to gin at the Angola State Farm, ca. 1900. The Angola State Farm, 8,000 acres located upriver of Baton Rouge on the Mississippi River, and Hope State Farm, 4,700 acres located to the west in Iberia Parish on Bayou Teche, were a source of profit to the state, though that profit varied widely from year to year depending on weather and floods. Angola produced cotton and cotton seed, corn, sweet potatoes, cow peas, hay, and broom corn. Angola prisoners also manufactured hides, tallow, and meat boxes. Hope Farm produced sugar, syrup, cow peas, corn, sweet potatoes, and hay. Inmates on Hope Farm also manufactured sugar and molasses barrels' – Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D.

Front view, State Penitentiary at Baton Rouge.	Penitentiary	Lytle, Andrew David, 1834-1917.	1900?-1901?	Photograph : gelatin silver print	'Lytle Studio appears to have begun contract photography work around 1900. This series of images created in Louisiana State prison facilities, ca. 1900, documents the physical plant and social conditions in these institutions. From 1869 until 1900, the Louisiana State Penitentiary system was operated under a private lease to Major S. L. James. Conditions under his oversight were brutal at best, fatal at worst.  In 1900, the system was completely overhauled, the lease bought from the heirs of Major James, and a new state board took control effective October 1, 1900. That new board's 1901 annual report, published in 1902, was illustrated with halftone reproductions of Lytle photographs. This is an exterior view of the state penitentiary from the street, ca. 1900. The penitentiary was located in Baton Rouge between Florida and Laurel Streets, running from Seventh to Tenth.'   Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D. Lytle’s Baton Rouge: photographs 1863-1910, (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 2008), p. 33. See, "Board of Control State Penitentiary Report," HV 8338 A2, 1901, page 16a.
