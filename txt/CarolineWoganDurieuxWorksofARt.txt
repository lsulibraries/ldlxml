Fashion	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1953	Women	the satire in this print is seen in the depiction of a female's face "adorned" with the exotic , fantastic, and extremely ornate eyeglasses which were in vogue in the 1950's. The satire 's comment is made in that the lady is no beauty, and the eyeglasses she thinks beautiful, only add to her unsuspected, unbecoming flamboyancy.	the drawing was initially made with the radioactive ink applied with dry brush. The print presents a highly textured tonal areas due to the natural texture of the paper. The fibers of the drawing from which the print was made on sensitized paper were made radioactive and the fibers print in dark tones thus allowing this condition of the paper to work for the artist.

Aux halles	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Women; Paris	The subject is that of a rather tough-looking woman from the market district in Paris. The artist felt she was typical of those "ladies" who were frequently seen in this area of the city.	The print is an etching using the standardlift ground technique on a copper plate. The work was printed first in black and white on cream-toned paper. To add warmth, a light red color was applied by hand.

Club	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1952	Women; Clubs	The scene depicts the LSU faculty club's mail lounge in which the faculty wives would often meet. Ms. Durieux recalled it was a popular meeting place for social gatherings of ladies' groups. Two seated female figures dominate the central plane and display the artist's enjoyment of contrasting the generations, a subject she claimed, "...always amuses me."	The work was printed from an initial drawing made on architects' tracing cloth. This vehicle allows the print to reproduce the fine linen weave thus creating a finely woven texture to the work. The drawing was made using brush and ink and pen and ink., both ink solutions being radioactive.

Friends of poseiden	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1966	Abstract paintings; Fish; Aquatic animals	This cliche-verre is worked in shades of grey. The design of the print  suggests the frenzy of the various sea creatures.	A later edition of this print was reworked by the artist in which a yellow color was added. The artist related that she feels the yellow greatly enhances the results of the printing.  A single matrix was used in this print with the negative areas created by scraping away the emulsion from the matrix. Ms. Durieux  recalled her intention when first designing the print. It seems she was  invited to spend a weekend on the gulf coast at the LSU Wetlands experimental Station in Ocean Springs, Ms. While on this excursion, the artist experienced a number of fishing-related activities. Her experiences influenced her design.	8 of 10	Image	Cliché- verre	13-5/8 x 16-1/2 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Bipeds dancing	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1932	Men; Women; Dance; Dance parties	The setting for the print's composition was the Mexico City Country Club. The obvious contradiction was in the name of the club and the predominate number of foreign ethnic types. The characters depicted are said by the artist to be "types"  which fall out of her memory whenever needed. She related that she never draws anybody in particular, for everybody can be classed into a particular " type."	The method of drawing used by the artist required the use of only a lithographic pencil. Different textures is a result of how fine the stone is ground.	2 of 10	Image	Black lithograph	7-7/8 x 8-5/8 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Creola	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1936	Women; Portraits	This bust-length female figure is not an actual portrait, but is another of the satirical "types" drawn from the artist's imagination. The figure is turned left roughly three quarters to the picture plane. The subject is a thin woman with thin, penciled eyebrows, and an upturned nose which terminates in broad nostrils. The subject's eyes are narrow slits and she has high cheekbones, as well as thin lips with very dark lipstick  and her teeth are uneven. Her hair is arranged in a very curly permanent as was fashionable during the 1930s. Her dress has a square cut neckline which is bordered with ruffles and there are puff sleeves at the shoulders made of a mesh material which is decorated with stars.	This print is part of the artists' y MRSINorth American Seriesttp://, and was printed from zinc plates and executed in Taxco, Mexico. This print is unnumbered and was not included in Cynthia Lamey's Caroline Durieux exhibition in 1965. Mrs. Durieux cannot remember the print. She thinks that this is a printer's proof of a lithograph that was never made as an edition.

Gigolo	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1977	Women; Men; Skeletons; Hugging	Two figures are shown waist length dancing. The female figure who faces the viewer is a large corpulent woman with shoulder length curly hair and much makeup. The woman wears a fairly low cut dress  which is decorated with polka dots  and has a broad choker necklace about her neck and coming down her cleavage. She has been toned  with a reddish watercolor to give a flesh-like look. She grasps her partner with ample arms and large hands with dark fingernail polish. The male figure, whose back is to the viewer, is actually a skeleton which has straight hair. These two figures are situated against a background of grey, amorphous forms which the artist has shaded slightly with red.		8 of 10	Image	Watercolored electron	H:14-1/2 x 17-3/8 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

The line is quite interesting with its  velvety, yet crumbly character. The line is created using a radioactive ink solution applied to the brush.

Opera	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1954	Women	The print deals with the vanity of a single mature woman. The mouth is cruelly small, with wrinkles running from its corners.	This is an electron print by the artist while at LSU. The print is done in two colors, brown and red. An additional edition was also done, it being printed in black and white. It was stated by the artist that understatement is more scornful than exaggeration.. The satire is obvious," stated the artist, "this female is apparently unaware of her state and how she appears to others.. The drawing for this work, done on stone, was made using a lithographic crayon, brush and lithographic ink. A small amount of scarping was employed to highlight desired areas.	6 of 6	Image	Black electron	14-7/8 x 10-1/4 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Fear	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1945	Men	The scene is a comment on the havoc of war. Here in the print, one sees that fear came from the sky, a statement on the air artillery attacks of WWII. As Ms. Durieux so appropriately stated, at that time, "... fear came from the heavens..."	Printed at LSU, Baton Rouge, LA by the artist. The entire printing process was handled solely by the artist. Ms. Durieux created the drawing on the stone using lithographic pencil, lithographic ink and scraping. The work is printed on an American made-paper, as the preferred French lithographic paper was unobtainable due to the war.	7 of 10	Image	Black lithograph	7 x 7 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

The negative and light areas were the result of just not working the areas, therefore making scraping unnecessary.

Escape	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1962	Abstract paintings; Textiles	The subject presents an abstracted form which appears as if escaping from behind a thin veiling.	The initial drawing was done by Ms. Durieux using lithographic pencil, brush and lithographic ink washes, and a minimal amount of scraping. The dots which appear within the composition were created using the lithographic gum-arabic technique. Ms. Durieux said that she has always had a number of ideas based on different means of escape and the depiction of such is to be listed among her favorite subjects. The colors used in this print are warm pink, red and black. The artist allows the white of the paper to serve as a fourth color within the composition.

Jurassic ooze	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1960	Abstract paintings	The print is composed of shades of green with random veiled areas of yellow. White areas with selected magenta patches are also evident in the composition.	This is a  cliché verre which required two printings to achieve the desired results. The artist related that she felt the yellow areas were needed to balance the color composition, while the magenta filters through to add warmth to the work. <Ms. Durieux had no intention as to the work's social comment, as she was simply experimenting with the different time exposures to the light source.. The artist cut out shapes in paper then allowed the light to work upon exposed areas. This work was quite experimental as there were no real calibrations with concern to the light exposure.	3 of 5	Image	Color cliché verre	11-1/4 x 15-3/4 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Survivor	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1947	Abstract paintings; Men; Lions	This scene was suggested by an actual Mexican beggar whose memory haunted the artist for years after a trip to Vera Cruz  in Mexico. Ms. Durieux stated that she employed no exaggeration, as the unfortunate man appeared as depicted. The bent, twisted limbs with their ragged pads indicated he had never stood upright, but lived in a wretched condition. Ms. Durieux continued to elaborate on the figure by saying he was unable to speak as well. She remarked that Katherine Ann Porter, in her book Ship of Fools, mentions and describes this same beggar. The beggar was in actuality, doing just fine financially with his begging.. The artist stated that due to his horror, people would give him money just to leave their presence. He found it advantageous to beg at the hotel sidewalk cafes.	also Acc.

Benediction	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1932	Men; Public speaking; Priests	The inspiration for this work came to the artist while she attended a church service in a small country church outside Mexico City. The psychology of the priest, who raises his hand in benediction strongly suggests that he is an Indian of the region. The artist instills a suggestion of instability of the atmosphere in the handling of the pulpit's design.	This work was one of the first done by the artist. It so happens that this is the second state of the design. The original was discarded due to the inexperience of the artist. Ms. Durieux related that she had no idea the design would be printed in reverse, a mirror-image of the original drawing.

Dead worlds	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1953	Ghosts	Cloudy haze from behind which human skulls appear as if haunting visions of a dead world.	This drawing of this print was made using washes of radioactive ink applied with a brush. Pen and ink was also employed. Due to technical aspects, the printing technique allows every layer of the wash applied to the print to be visible in the final work. All the tonal areas of the print were done by brush.

Brume et pluie	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1950	Men; Women	Tthe subject represents, as the title suggests, the fog and the rain.	The colors each of which represents a separate run of the master stone, are greenish-grey, a grayed greenish-yellow, and a purple-red. The actual drawing was made using a dry brush and ink on stone. Ms. Durieux related that it is only the French printers who can achieve such perfect colors.. The French printers are really good: they have excellent taste when it comes to color.. The "rain" in the print is the result of fine runs of the brush across the stone. The foggy masses were achieved by the use  of ink washes.

Liane	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1950	Hands; Plants	The subject matter, as the title suggests, shows a vine which wraps and clings around a human hand. The appears lifeless, whereas the vine, or rather, the line that creates the vine. is active and animated.	This print was made by the artist while at LSU. The print is made from a drawing done on stone, using a lithographic crayon, lithographic ink and scraping. The work is a composition in which line is dominant. The artist creates this feeling of activity within the line by the "tonal" width and variance within the line. The artist related that so often one may see a vine which covers and conceals that upon which it thrives.

Bright aquarium	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1964	Abstract paintings; Fish; Aquariums	Fish forms "swim" across the composition; their forms creating a pattern of yellow, white, magenta, blue, blu-green, and orange. A suggestion of sea waves plays across the background creating a pattern of red-orange and yellow with orange crosshatching randomly placed throughout the pattern.	This is a cliché vérre which employed the use of three matrices, one matrix for each primary color. The artist allowed the overprinting to create secondary and terciary color forms throughout the composition. The crosshatching effect was achieved by using a "brillo pad" to scrape the emulsion of the matrices.

First communion	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1944	Women; Veils	The subject is that of the first communion of a Negro Child. The composition is placed within an oval shape, a favorite format used by the artist.	This lithograph was printed at LSU. Ms. Durieux ground the stone herself and made the drawing using a lithographic pencil and scraping. The print is on a fine quality rag paper which was quite difficult to obtain during the war years. Since the oval format is a rather difficult shape for lithography printing, Ms. Durieux kept  several stones worked with oval planes ready for use. The artist used scraping to create the white areas of the veil; these white areas serving to create the illusion of the veil's being in front of the face. The texturing in the background is a favorite device used by Ms. Durieux. This texturing also serves to differentiate the planes of the print. The scene is taken from a number of sketches one by Ms. Durieux. At the time she was working on a project for Lyle Saxon in which she made a number of drawings based on the activities of Negro children. Saxon Durieux, Edward Dreyer, and Robert Tallant were working on a book about Louisiana traditions and folklore, Gumbo Ya-Ya.

Art class or la classe de dessin	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1939	Art education; Painting; Racks (Supporting devices); Women; Students	The scene represents an art class which Ms. Durieux inherited from another teacher while she was employed at Newcomb College in New Orleans. The preceding instructor emphasized to the class the practice of proportional gauging of the subject matter by using one's pencil extended vertically at arm's length. Notice how the artist emphasized the student's pencils with a bold application of lithographic ink. The treatment of the windows in the background was deliberately exaggerated to create an upward movement within the composition. This movement is held in check by the placement of a darker broad horizontal line in the upper region of the print.	This drawing was done using a lithographic pencil and ink.

Flower form	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1963	Flowers	The cliche-verre is composed of a floriated central mass worked in shades of magenta, ranging from bright to a very deep magenta.	This work has been considered by the artist to be a most "...fun work to do...yet, a difficult work..  The print was the result of a simple printing. The fringed are of the composition was achieved by a vigorous scraping away of the emulsion. The scraping done to the matrix resulted in the large negative area surrounding the mass. The darkening of the colors was achieved by a double exposure to the light source. The first exposure consisted of allowing the entire matrix to be subjected to the light rays. The second exposure required the blocking out of the central massing and particular areas in order to allow for a color darkening of the unprotected areas.	7 of 12	Image	Color cliché- verre	12-1/2 x 16-3/4 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

NICE MEN	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1936	NA	This lithograph was printed in 1936. It was the first work in which the artist used a zinc plate rather than the usual lithographic stone. The print was printed by George Miller in New York. Ms. Durieux had never drawn on a zinc plate before and therefore was hesitant in her use of strong blacks. She related that, at the time of the print's planning, she figured scraping wouldn't work as well on the zinc plate as on the lithographic stone; therefore she minimized her use of scraping. The idea for the print becomes quite obvious when one compares how the "nice men" stand out vividly from their white background with the manner in which "American types" stand out when seen in a foreign country. This was the gist of the artist's intention. An added touch of humor is suggested by the handling of the conspicuous pockets and bow ties of the men.

Shelter	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1962	Abstract paintings	The subject depicted is a creature who seems content and protected behind a shelter of cross bars.	The three colors used are dark purple, greenish- yellow and a white overprinting. The initial drawing made by the artist was done using a lithographic pencil. Scraping was used to create white lines throughout the composition. The creature, which is doglike in appearance, is claimed by the artist to be a figment of her own imagination. It is neither dog nor fox but is definitely a wild creature which has taken refuge from man and nature behind the shelter provided.

Dark hands	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1949	Hands; Smoke	This subject matter, as seen in the large dark hands which loom in the  central picture plane, reflects the artist's reaction to the growing public awareness of the racial problem in society which began to make itself heard during the fifties.	This lithograph was printed by the artist at LSU. The print was done using stone on which the drawing was made using a lithographic pencil. Scraping was employed in moderation. The lithograph displays some innovations used by the artist. Ms. Durieux was, at the time of the printing, interested in seeing how far she could carry the black and white lithograph technique. Here, she creates  the hazy areas and fuzz-like edges by rubbing these areas with a piece of felt which results in a smoky haze. The composition is printed on Basinwerk parchment, which is a quality  English paper.

Golfer	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1932	Golfers; Women; Golf	The drawing was done with a lithographic pencil, ink, and crayon. Scraping within the composition is used to create texturing. The flat black of the golfer's shoes was created by painting directly on the stone with ink applied with a brush. The satire is based on the ridiculousness of the golfer's mode of dress. The character is suggestive of an American appearing rather absurd in his blooming, bellowing plus fours. To emphasize this situation, the artist has placed the golfer against a background in which nature is not ridiculous. Ms. Durieux related that she obviously was not a golfer herself: "I don't love golf, although I've tried to learn...but, with the beautiful landscape of the Mexican countryside, I was more interested in the scenery than the game."	This lithograph was printed at the studio Senefelders in Mexico City in 1932.	8 of 10	Image	Black lithograph	13 x 8-3/4 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Lemmings	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Abstract paintings; Lemmings	The print presents abstracted stick-like representations of human legs and feet, all of which are directed as though moving across the picture plane. Ms. Durieux stated that these legs and feet carry the people away in one direction. She stated that the mass movement of such large bodies of people, as witnessed in the subway terminals, recalled the mass migrations of lemmings, small furry footed rodents of Europe.	The print is a three colored lithograph in greyed-yellow, greyed-light blue and a whitish grey with a slight amount of pink added for warmth. The artist related that the idea for this design came to her after experiencing the rush hour of the Paris metro.	8 of 15	Image	Color lithograph	18-1/4 x 14-1/8 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

This cliché verre was printed with one dye, but because of the thickness of the matrix emulsion, the wide range of colors resulted. The amount of time exposure to the li9ght source also influenced the color results in the print. The print ranges from shades of deep lavender to shades of green. The bubble-texture of the background was the result of minimal exposure to the light source. The artist definitely desired this textured background to support the activity of the central areas.

This print ranks among the earliest  of the electron prints done by Ms. Durieux. Therefore, it is of an experimental nature. Ms. Durieux related that only a few prints were in this edition as she was experimenting to see if a color electron print was possible. The print is made from a single matrix with a thick emulsion film. It was printed in three colors: light red, yellow, and purplish-grey. The light red areas were created using a brush dipped in the radioactive dye and literally applied to the matrix.

Ghostly peanuts	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Abstract paintings; Ghosts; Peanuts	The subject is a whimsical one for the artist. By allowing the color of the print to create a mood, she arranges "ghostly" looking peanut forms in the composition. These forms appear to be descending a curving stair case and stare out to the viewer appearing as apparitions within their environment. Each form appears to emerge from a darkened cloud-like outline wile bold white lines define each form.	This is an etching using the line and aquatint techniques and was printed at the home studio of M. Durieux.

Bather	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1932	Men; Women; Bathing suits; Oceans; Beaches	The scene depicted in the print recalled a visit the artist made to Acapulco, Mexico. Ms. Durieux related that in 1932, Acapulco's beaches were relatively abandoned locations. The composition strengthens this solitude, which the beaches offered, by the suggestion of the unfrequented beach and the lone vessel in the background. The humor of the print is, of course, presented by the handling of the monumental female figure.	The drawing was created with both lithographic pencil and ink.	9 o 10	Image	Black lithograph	9 x 10-3/4 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

The Boston Club is represented in the background by its traditional reviewing stand where Rex "toasts" his Queen and Court. Ms. Durieux depicts the carnival monarch unmasked, as is the tradition. Rex wears no mask, and allows the gaiety of the occasion to be revealed by his face.	The print, done on stone, was drawn using lithographic pencil.

PREVIEW	Durieux, Caroline			This lithograph was printed from a zinc plate worked by the artist and sent to George Miller in New York for printing. The print is included in those considered to belong to Ms. Durieux's "North American Series". The name for this series is derived from the fact that Ms. Durieux uses all American "types" in these prints. The method of drawing used for this print was achieved by using a lithographic pencil, crayon, and some ink. The scene depicts an opening of exhibition of abstract art in which the participants appear rather ignorant of the works and their meanings. "It's all rather new to them as seen by their expressions.. The setting is a pseudo-classical gallery in which the classical feel of the background columns contrasts with the ornate frames of the art works, which in turn contrasts with their contents. All of this adds to the incongruous atmosphere and adds to the satire of the print.	Image unavailable.

Lovers	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1974	Love; Legs; Skeletons	Within an elongated vertical oval, the legs of two figures stand on a light and dark diamond patterned floor. All that can be seen of the male figure is the skeletal form of his legs and feet from a back sided angle. He faces his lover, a female of whom the viewer can see only a little of her very short skirt which looks like a skater's costume. Her spindly legs are thinner than the skeletal ones of her lover's. Her feet are incased in male type house slippers, each decorated with a pompon.		9 of 10	Image	Black and white electron	18-1/2 x 13 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Wraiths	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1962	Abstract paintings	Abstract composition of "lost spirits" which are wandering aimlessly in a nether-world without heaven or hell.	This cliché verre print involved the use of two separate matrices. The composition is composed of shades of deep green with a yellow overprinting. The first matrix printed carried the principal drawing while the second matrix added the color. The overprinting of yellow creates a stripped pattern which allows for the background color to permeate.	3 of 10	Image	Color cliché verre	16-1/4 x 11 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Visitor	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1944	Skeletons; Women; Doors & doorways	The print depicts the presentation of death as a beautiful and elegantly dressed woman.	The drawing was made using lithographic pencil and crayon and some use of scraping. The stone was coarsely ground by the artist to achieve a slight texturing to the overall surface. The artist made the design during the war years when  death was an ever present reality to all. The idea for the print came to the artist while at a party in New Orleans. There were many soldiers present. Quite often during the evening the question would be asked, "Where's so and so?. The answer seemed always the same,  "Why, he was lost at Wake, or Guam, or in the Pacific." Ms. Durieux felt that death stood at the door of the party, waiting to meet one of those soldiers present.

Desiree	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1947	Women; Sitting	The heavy, sagging body of the woman, who sits on the stoop outside her house, adds to the unsuspected ridicule of the woman. To add to the ridicule she sits attired in her finery, with lace trimming and a flower pinned in her hair. What might have been an alluring position in a young woman becomes sadly vulgar here.	This lithograph was printed at LSU. This print, drawn entirely in pencil on stone, uses title to create the irony of the satire. Ms. Durieux related that she often saw such a scene in New Orleans . There were two ladies in particular who'd sit outside, apparently a very old habit of the two. It was from these two that Ms. Durieux was inspired to make this design.	10 of 20	Image	Black lithograph	12-3/4 x 9-1/2 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Commencement	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1947	People; Graduation ceremonies	The drawing depicts the first commencement seen  by the artist at LSU. The figures also suggested to the artist the "Captains of Erudition" from Thorstein Viblems' the Higher Learning in America. Symbols are employed within the design. For example, the birds are buzzards flying in the background. Buzzards are usually associated as being attracted to dead things and as Ms. Durieux  commented, "...some commencements are dead from the start..." must be careful that every line used must serve a purpose. She the added that same is true of satire, everything used must serve the purpose of the satire.	This lithograph was printed by the artist at LSU in 1947. The print uses an economy of line, with all lines made by a lithographic crayon on stone. The width of the line determines the tone of the print.

Bal masque	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1946	Carnival; Balls (Parties); Kings; Queens; Masquerades	The scene presents a representation of a carnival ball in which a social presentation of marriageable young ladies are escorted by masked gentlemen of the carnival court.  These are viewed by the elderly mothers and grandmothers, who gossip and comment on the young replicas of themselves, their daughters. The artist presents in this self-contained design, females as the important elements. The males serve as decorative elements within the composition. The satire and the design are built on a circular movement. One may interpret the representation of the three generations as three generations of "puppets" repeating a social pattern. Also, the series of circles within the composition may suggest the idea that the New Orleans' spirit of Carnival is never ending, a tradition that goes on from generation to generation.	The work was done on stone using a lithographic pencil. No scraping was employed.

Escape	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1972	Hands; Walls	The print depicts another interpretation of a favorite subject of the artist -- that of escape.	This print was made by the artist while at LSU. In this work the artist presents an active composition in which two hands serve as the central focal point. The hands clutch desperately at the top edge of a brick wall. The fingers appear to scratch deep into the bricks while crumbling particles fall in a patterned play  of white, grey and black. The surfaces throughout the composition are activated by the texturing of each. The dark foreboding sky in the background appears heavy and threatening as it is composed of thick bold brush lines made to appear even darker by several overlays of washes.	8 of 10	Image	Black and white cliché-verre	6-15/16 x 7-3/4 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Rugged American	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1936	Men; Women	American tourists.	This lithograph was printed as a part of the artist's North American Series. The print was made from zinc plates execute in Taxco, Mexico. The actual drawing was made by the artist, depicting a tourist couple she saw while in Mexico. The couple appeared very earnest and very rugged to the artist. She noted that they both appeared with sharp features with piercing eyes. This prints employs an economy of tonal values, allowing line to dominate. Line is most carefully used by the artist. One may note that Line, due to cautious and precise handling by the artist, creates a feeling of air and space within the composition. Such is suggested by definite "breaks" between linear points -- allowing a negative space to exist between line, with no lines overlapping.

Taxidermy	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1946	Women; Portraits	The satire of the print is obvious. The lady is depicted apparently feeling quite "stylish" in her hat. The bird which sets upon the hat conveys an association with its wearer. Note the similarity of their eyes, and the handling of the beak and nose. The lady appears to look like the product of a taxidermist and does the bird on her hat. The treatment of the wings arch upward suggesting antler-like appendages of the woman. Antlers are often considered trophies, as are stuffed birds, thus the satire is stated. Ms. Durieux related that she actually saw this woman while waiting in line at the bus depot. That which fascinated the artist is seen in the print.	This lithograph was printed from a drawing made using lithographic pencil on a finely ground stone. It was printed by the artist at LSU in 1946.

Blind	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	CA. 1955-62	Men; Women; Blind persons	The print depicts emaciated figures, one male one female, who appear quite alone in their afflictions.	This etching was printed in the home studio of the artist. The print was made using white ink on blue oriental paper. An additional edition was printed in  the traditional black on white. Ms. Durieux related that the most popular of the two editions were those done in white on blue. A fine delicate character of line appears throughout the etching and by means of crosshatching and linear overlay, the artist creates a delicacy of tonal values within the forms. Bold white lines serve as boundary  lines between and around each figure.	4 of 10	Image	White etching on blue rice paper	8-1/2 x 5-11/16 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Exile	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1939	Men; Exiles	A Jewish exhile.	This lithograph is from theartist's "New Orleans Series". It is drawn with a lithographic pencil and using a brush with lithographic ink. One may note that the entire background is ink painted onto the stone by brush. The suggestion for the face in the print came from an experience in New Orleans. Ms. Durieux  had x-rays made while in New Orleans by a young x-ray technician. The technician was a Jew who seemed to have one of the saddest faces seen by the artist. As it was the time of Jewish persecution in Germany, the artist related his saddened features of those misfortunate Jews in  Europe. She used his face to represent the exiled Jew at this time of world trouble. The black background surrounds the face and adds to the feeling of dark sadness of the work. The background, related Ms. Durieux, is again a technical "device" used by the artist. The black area allows the viewer to become involved in the composition allowing the viewer's eye to create an outline for the face and head of the youth. "A technical device is used by the artist for the viewer's sake... a technical device belongs to the artist, not the viewer."	10 of 12	Image	Black lithograph	10-1/2 x 9 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Parapet	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1953	People; Balconies	Mankind is presented by the use of a solitary standing human form. He is placed before a dark parapet over which he gazes into the dark void of the world. It appears a most solemn occasion.  Ms. Durieux related that the print's subject is one of those things that "...were it to be put into words, then there would be no need for this drawing..  The print allows the viewer to interpret the mystery which appears to be hidden behind the parapet.	Same print edition Acc. No. 2001.3.67.

Banc Parisian	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1950	Women; Men; Benches; Public speaking	The scene depicts a French beach and is typical of the "sights" one might see enjoying the beaches. Four men and women sit on the benches. Two of them are talking to each other.	The drawing, done on stone, was made using lithographic pencil, crayon and ink. Scraping was used in desired areas. It is interesting that the print has an overprinting of reduced pink ink applied to add color to the work. In addition, this edition  was printed on cream toned paper, also adding warmth to the prints. Ms Durieux stated that the "types" seen in the print are representative of those general personalities she'd see when visiting the beaches herself.

Swine maskers, Mardi Gras day	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1946	Carnival; Masks; Costumes; Swine	The print depicts a costume created and worn by Mr. Eddie Dreyer one Carnival Day. The idea behind the costume is that of casting pearls to swine, thus the enormous pig's head decorated with hundreds of pearls. In the print, Ms. Durieux has developed the central element three times, slightly changing it each time, to create the desired pattern. The pattern also suggests the setting, that Victor's Bar at the corner of Chartres and Toulouse in the French Quarter. It seems that Victor's would set out tables with checkered cloths on its sidewalk every Mardi Gras as a courtesy to its customers.	Drawing on stone using lithographic pencil.

Greens and greys	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1950	Abstract paintings	The subject is an abstracted composition of crossing lines which, related the artist, was inspired by a spider's web.	The print is made of three colors: an egg yellow, gray and chartreuse. Ms. Durieux related that the colors are not hard to distinguish for French printers who were always so anxious that the number of runs made are easily discernable.

Oppression and madness	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1942	Men	The print depicts two captive figures isolated within what one may consider to be a cell. A single window in the background allows for a stream of sunlight to filter into the area behind the figures, yet they take no notice of it, nor the warmth it may offer.	The drawing was made using lithographic pencil, some lithographic ink and brush, and a minimal amount of scraping. The print is a general comment on the war years. Ms. Durieux was much involved with the tragedies which occurred in the Pacific and Europe. The print expresses the oppression  of war as sensed by the artist. When commenting on the print, Ms. Durieux related that in the lithography technique, no one print of an edition is better than the others as far as quality is concerned. Her reference was made in comparison to the drypoint printing technique in which the first prints are considered best. Ms. Durieux stated that lithography, ".  The stone doesn't wear out in the hands of a good printer."

Judith	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Women	The women is a representation of Judith from the Old Testament. It is a facial study of a female figure who represents the Biblical character of Judith.	The lithograph is part of the artist's Old Testament Women Series. The print uses four colors -- a chartreuse, dark grey, pink flesh tones, and light grey. The initial drawing was made using dry brushes and washes.

Fragmented clowns	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1961	Abstract paintings	White fragmented abstracted "clowns" on yellow background.	This is a cliché verre printed in shades of yellow-green. The print required the use of two matrices. The artist related that the same color dye as that used in the print, "Rejected Angels", was used in this particular print. The obvious difference in the colors was the result of the time of the light exposure to the print. "Fragment clowns" required less time. This shortening of the time exposure resulted not only in a variation in the dye color reproduced in the print, but in the disallowance of a bubble-texture in the print. Ms. Durieux stated that the print reflected a personal reasoning held by the artist. She has always equated clowns with fragmented people.

Calvaire	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1951	Aged persons; Men	Bust-sized portrait of a haggard, old Frenchman whose head is three quarters turned to the picture plane looking left.	The print is marked "tirage-11 epreuves" marked in artist's pencil script in the lower right border. The sitter has a craggy, pointed face which is dominated by a large Gallic nose. His chin projects while his upper lip recedes. His eyes are slits and are dark and mysterious. The figure wears a black beret, a sweater in brownish tones, and a scarf in plaid  design in browns, yellows, and blue green.

Spectators	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1942	Spectators	The scene is a depiction of a group of spectators assembled to witness an event in New Orleans's City Park. The artist recalled that the sickly-looking palm trees in the background immediately brought to mind such that were "growing" in City Park. "Perhaps they were blessed with death during the last great cold spell New Orleans had.. The spectators, who view an activity placed outside the picture plane, are simply American types often used by the artist. "They're no one in particular, "says the artist, until someone says, 'why, that's so-and-so.'"	This lithograph was printed from a zinc plate. No scraping was used in the drawing made using lithographic pencil.

Profiles	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1945	Men; Women	The print is a comment, made by the artist, at the beginning of Black demands for equality. The phrygian cap worn by the Negro female reinforces this idea of liberty and equality. The idea that this type of cap was also worn by the French revolutionists augments the suggestion of liberty being sought. The shape of the cap also serves as a device which leads the eye of the viewer back to the center of the composition. Ms. Durieux stated, "...you can't get out of this picture to save your life."	This lithograph was printed by the artist while at LSU in Baton Rouge. The print was made on quality rag paper. The work is printed from a drawing done on stone, using a lithographic pencil. The design is composed entirely in line. The "width" of the line produces the tonal areas of the work.

Le puit	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1950	Hands	Two human hands appear as if robbed of life and sinking into the depths of the well.	the initial drawing was made using pen and ink, brush and ink, and rubbing on the stone. The colors used are warm brown, yellow and black. The scene is, as the title translates,. The well.. The well represents a final resting place for Ms. Durieux. "wells always appeared sinister to me, " stated the artist. The tonal areas within the hands were created by rubbing. the French printer working on the actual printing, Desjobert, felt an area needed to pick up more ink, thus printing a darker tone; therefore additional grease was needed in this area. The printer then took his finger and rubbed it behind his ear. By using this natural body oil rubber on the stone, he was able to add the additional " grease" thus allowing the stone to pick up more ink. Ms. Durieux, commenting on this trick-of-the-trade, said that she did learn a great deal from the French, although, "her head is not that greasy."

Piano stool	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1952	Stools; Women; Abstract paintings	The subject matter suggests an abstract figure seated upon a piano stool at an upright piano.	This print is from the first edition of electron prints ever made by the artist. The artist was thus experimenting to determine the reaction and possibility of using the isotope, Sulphur 35, for electron printing. The drawing was made from an ink wash which had been mixed with radioactive sulphur. Ms. Durieux commented that this wash method was quite unsatisfactory , for in electron printing , every layer of the ink wash will print in the final print. "There is simply no loss of design whatsoever.. The design was done as a spur of the moment reaction in order to continue with the experimental print technique. Ms. Durieux did relate that the subject brought to mind her childhood piano lessons when one was "forced" to sit and practice. She confessed such a tactic was unsuccessful with her.

Blue abstraction	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1960	Abstract paintings	The print is an abstracted composition of forms composed in shades of blue.	This is a color electron  that used Sulfur 35. The artist used two matrices; using the same matrix to print the darker blue areas and the "veiled" areas. This printing was the first time Ms. Durieux used the veiled effect in her electron prints. Such an effect is the result of the matrix film itself and the degree of the thickness of its emulsion. Ms. Durieux related that is was during the printing of this work that she realized the various possibilities the emulsion properties would allow. The bold textured drawing in the central massing area was created by pulling the emulsion with the film.

DRESSMAKING	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1932	NA	This lithograph was printed in Mexico City at the studio of Senefelders. The artist used a lithographic pencil, crayon and scraping.. The inspiration for this print came from the fact that personal dressmakers were quite popular in Mexico City. Ms. Durieux had two Mexican dressmakers whose shop she frequently visited. It was during one of these visits that the artist witnessed a similar situation as that depicted in the print. In this print the artist has exaggerated the female customer for the sake of satire. The two female attendants are definitely Mexican-Indian types as compared to the Spanish characteristics of the customer.

Possession	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1962	Abstract paintings	The subject matter depicted is that of a monumental clawed hand-like form which is entangled in a vine-like growth. The vine in turn is held captive by the prong-like claws of the massing. The subject also could be interpreted as an entanglement of a thwarted escape, thus serving as a variation on an escape theme often used by the artist.  the drawing by Ms. Durieux was made using lithographic crayon, lithographic ink and scraping. The tonal areas were created by a layering of lines upon lines. Ms. Durieux creates , in this print, the suggestion of self-entanglement or possession as the title indicates. Ms. Durieux stated that the tonal characteristics of these forms strongly create a sense of three-dimensionality within the composition.

She also printed a small number of black and white editions to see whether she preferred the subject on colored paper or black paper.

Le Voile	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Women; Veils	A woman with dotted veil.  This lithograph uses three colors -- greyish-yellow, whitish pink, and stone grey. The initial drawing was made using a lithographic crayon, brush, lithographic ink, and scraping. The dark area of the female face's eyes are the result of an overprinting of all three colors. Ms. Durieux related that veils have always fascinated her. The artist saw this stylish woman at the opening of a Parisian Fashion House. Her expression is aristocratic, but skeptical of her surroundings, yet she is calm behind the veil of her hat. Ms. Durieux made the sketch of this anonymous female upon returning to her apartment. The sketch, in turn, resulted in this final design for the lithograph.

Stellar explosion	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1961	Explosions; Abstract paintings	An explosion of a stellar mass.	In this cliché verre print, the artist used a single matrix. The different shades of blue were achieved by varying the thickness levels of the emulsion on the matrix. The negative areas were the result of scraping away portions of the emulsion from the matrix. The title, which clearly describes the composition, once brought a query to the artist. Ms. Durieux was informed by a young scientist that all stellar explosions were yellow. Ms. Durieux warmly replied that such may be the case, but her explosion was blue.	7 of 16	Image	Color cliché verre	15-1/4 x 13 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Insomnie	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Night; Cemeteries; Crosses; Skeletons; Abstract paintings	A single skeleton sits up, as if a restless,  in its final resting place.	Considered by the artist to be her favorite print. The colors used are greenish dark grey, brownish grey and a greenish black. The initial drawing was made using brush and ink with scraping. The idea for this composition came to the artist while she traveled through the Italian countryside. It was then that she passed an enormous American cemetery for those servicemen  who died during the war (WWII). The cemetery covered several hills as does the cemetery scene depicted in the print. The stars in the print were created by scraping and "picking" out these areas with a fine pointed lithographic needle.	1 of 15	Image	Color Lithograph	16-1/2 x 10-3/8 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Cafe Tupinamba	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1934	Men; Cafes	Primarily the four men sitting around the circular bar room table loom larger than in the cartoon and their seated position in the chairs has been changed slightly. Their faces have all been made more porcine and all the men wear grey suits (the one with his back to the picture plane has a pinstripe) rather than white linen. Also, each man wears a white dress shirt.. The four men are seated in green cane bottom chairs having spool-turned rear stiles and three plain balusters for a splat. The only chair back that is fully shown is the one being used by the man with his back to the picture plane. The table at which they sit has a green top and the edge is black. The men at nine, three and six o'clock positions hold tiny stemmed liqueur glasses filled with a lime green colored drink. Each man wears a yellow boater with either circular or zigzag green lines creating the illusion of the straw pattern. Each hat also has a black silk band. The very fat bald man in the twelve o'clock position has a cigarette hanging out the right side of his mouth and he cuts his eyes to his right toward the man sitting in the nine o'clock position.	This painting is Ms. Durieux's own version of the art moderne style, and is widely regarded as her finest oil painting. It was executed in Mexico City - her son told HPB that there was a "Cafe Tupinamba" in that city when he, his mother and father lived there. This painting differs in a number of respects from the highly finished drawing "Cafe Tupinamba" (Acc. No. 91.25).

Park in Rio	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1942	Parks; Couples; Benches	The scene depicts a park in Rio. One may note the famous decorative tile sidewalks of Rio, very characteristic of the Portuguese artistic influence. The statue placed behind the couple is representative of those typical in the parks. This one represents a famous poet in Rio, thus suggesting a "poet's corner" in the park. The lush vegetation and tropical plants were actually researched and sketched by the artist. These sketches were then to assemble the background vegetation.	Edition of twelve prints, drawn with a lithographic pencil, lithographic ink and some scraping of the stone. The finely ground stone was shipped to George Miller in New York for printing in 1942.

Subculture	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1972	Abstract paintings	Ms. Durieux presents a scene in which large mushroom forms fill the composition. Skeletal figures distinctively characterized as types from the contemporary "hippie" subculture are placed around mushroom forms.	Print was made by the artist while she was at LSU. The isotope used was Promethium 147. The initial drawing was made using pen and ink, and brushed with washes. Ms. Durieux is commenting on the destructive character of the drug world, in particular L.S.D. Ms. Durieux related that a short time before she designed this work, a Harvard team of researchers released their findings on L.S.D., a drug extracted from mushrooms. The artist stated she did research on mushrooms, making numerous drawings and studies until she arrived at the final design. Ms. Durieux stated, "L.S.D. is so damn dangerous... it's very, very destructive.. The horror of the misuse of drugs is conveyed in this print.	4 of 10	Image	Black and white electron	18 x 13 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Angel	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Abstract paintings; Angels	The work is an abstracted composition of color which the artist entitled "Angel". Referring to the title, Ms. Durieux stated that one must give it a title, and being that it was an abstracted composition, the title should serve as a handle for the ordinary onlooker.	the colors used in the print are deep yellow and chartreuse.

the veil	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1939	Veils; Women	A woman with veil.	This print was drawn with a lithographic pencil and ink on stone. The entire satire lies in the fact that in this work, the "veil" veils nothing. The female is revealed for what she is  and she cannot hide behind the veil. The obvious character of the woman is revealed not only in her facial expression, but also by the military suggestion of her costume. The emphasis on the veil is created by use of ink and pen. The dots were created using ink, while the crisp line was fashioned with pen and ink. The crumbling lines in the print resulted from using a lithographic pencil and crayon.

Tomorrow	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1947	Men; women	The scene depicts two figures turning into stone. One can only guess at the cause for this transformation as all details are eliminated to give an abstract symbolic quality to the work.	This lithograph was printed by the artist while at LSU. The drawing, done on stone, was made using lithographic pencil. The figures appear to cling together in terror in the presence of an unseen force outside the vignetted picture plane. The force, claims the artist, is terror itself. Ms. Durieux related that she felt the statement of the print is still valid today, as the world doesn't look any better then it did then.

Luncheon	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1955	Men; Women; Eating & drinking	The print depicts, satirically, a ladies' luncheon.	This etching was printed in the home studio of the artist.. The print was made using white ink on blue oriental paper. This work was never printed in black and white. The scene is composed entirely of line and appears as a typical busy gathering of society ladies. Ms. Durieux recalls no one particular luncheon but appears typical of many she's attended. The quick activity in the line suggests that this luncheon is a "busy" one, perhaps to the point of appearing "noisy". Each "member" of this gathering is distinctively attired and a most interesting and varied array of hats is displayed. Ms. Durieux has made this not only a satirical comment on ladies' luncheons but on the extremes that millinery adventures go.	6 of 10	Image	White etching on blue rice paper	7-7/8 x 5-7/16 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Lost pentagons	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1958	Abstract paintings	The subject matter is an abstracted composition of pentagon forms made of lines created by brush work.	The isotope used in this print was Sulfur 35 combined with four color matrices. The colors present in the print are grey, dark greyish-green, blue-grey and red. The artist explained that the dark areas were created by overprinting. The dark dots seen in the print result from printing twice in dark grey then overprinting with red.  Ms. Durieux remarked that all the lines in the print were made using various brushes, varying in degrees of fineness.

Theatre lobby	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1974	Theaters; Lobbies; People; Audiences	In the best tradition of Durieux's satirical drawings this image pokes good-natured fun at a supposedly sophisticated theater audience in the lobby at intermission time. Note that the men are mostly middle aged and balding and the artist exaggerated the longer hair styles and full side burns in addition to the wearing of turtlenecks shirts with either a pendent on a gold chain (man in the middle ground left) or bolo tie (man on right).

Frail banner	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1963	Abstract paintings	The subject is that of a frail banner as suggested by the central massing of the composition. The banner appears as if it deteriorating.	This print is the first collaboration between Ms Durieux and Dr. John Christman, LSU. The print was made using two colors; pinkish brown and greenish brown. Slight variations of these colors result due to the thickness of the emulsion and the chemical reaction of these dyes to the light exposure. Ms. Durieux felt that the subject matter of the print made a symbolic statement if one recognized the banner as a symbol of organization, whether it be that of a nation or whatever.	2 of 7	Image	Color cliché verre	14-7/8 x 11-7/8 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Revelations	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1945	Women; Public speaking	The scene depicts a "revelation" which occurs during an intimate gossip session between two females. The females are each seated in a chair which appears to express the reaction of its occupant. The chairs therefore are exaggerated, as though they encircle and tensely listen to the gossip. Even the rug appears affected, a s its tufts stand on end. Everything, in its own manner, is used to serve the satire. Ms. Durieux related that there were a number of chairs in her family similar to these and a number of gossips as well.	This lithograph was printed by the artist at the printmaking facilities at LSU. The drawing, done in stone, was made using a lithographic pencil and a minimal amount of scraping. The composition is placed within a vignette plane. The work was printed on cream colored paper. The paper is a fine quality charcoal paper which had to be substituted due to the paper shortage created during the war.

Indifference	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Women	Young girl being blown by a gale.	the colors used are light brown, dark green and pale white. The pale white is an overprinting which gives a transparent effect to the wind-blown hair of the young girls depicted in this print. Ms. Durieux felt this last overprinting is quite effective in suggesting the element of wind blowing through hair. The subject, she related, is simply the face of a young girl she saw on a windy street in Paris. The initial drawing was made using a lithographic pencil and brush with ink washes.	5 of 15	Image	Color lithograph	18 x 13-1/2 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

She entered a posh hotel dining room and saw a child alone with only the waiters present. She returned to her room and made a quick sketch of the scene. It was later, upon return to the United States that she developed the final drawing.	This lithograph was drawn in a lithographic pencil and lithographic ink. The artist related that the process of having George Miller print the works was relatively uncomplicated. She would work on a stone ground fine on both sides. this allowed for her to draw on both sides. The stones were property of George Miller and were sent to Ms. Durieux for her to work her designs. After such, Ms. Durieux shipped the stones to New York for printing.

Les sorcieres effrayees	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1950	Abstract paintings	The work is basically linear in its presentation of witches' faces. These haggard faces become more obvious when viewed from a short distance, their forms merging from the variety of lines.	The print was conceived and worked in a reverse method -- i.e., working the stone from black to white. This is accomplished by employing large amounts of scraping, thus creating the light areas. Ms. Durieux related that she used a razor blade to scrape large portions thus creating a scumbling texture on the stone. She also assorted lithographic needles to create a variety of lines. The overprinting of purple adds warmth to the composition. Ms. Durieux stated that she was once told that one should have trouble seeing witches, thus, her witches are not so easily discernable.

Bourbon street, New Orleans	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1942	Singers; Bars	Two woman singers singing in a bar on Bourbon Street, New Orleans, La. The tile explains the scene, one typical to the nightclub activity of Bourbon Street. The scene is an active one in which a crowded audience of sailors and soldiers enjoy the performance of two female singers.	A minimal amount of scraping was employed by the artist on this print. The print was done in response to an invitation for Ms. Durieux's participation in a traveling exhibition. This 1942  exhibition was entitled "Artists for Victory" and was organized by the New York Graphic Society. The print is an artist copy. Ms Durieux related that another copy of this print "traveled" the entire South Pacific by boat. It seems that print was purchased by the wife of a commander of a P.T. boat and presented to her husband, who carried the print with him throughout his tour of duty. The singers, place in the immediate foreground, appear to convey the lively rhythm of "swing" music, so popular in the 1940's.

Decadence	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1950	Masks; Ghosts	The vignetted composition suggests a skull within its area, although it is a composite of all those forms, whether suggestive of a reality or not, which the artist felt looked decadent. One may interpret this work as an emotional response buy the artist to those visual forms suggested within the picture. Ms. Durieux felt that each form brings a disturbing reaction from herself.	Printed by the artist at LSU in 1950. The drawing, done on stone, was made using lithographic pencil, ink, scraping and rubbing. The rich dark areas are achieved by applying ink with a brush.

Queen of the Carnival at the Boston Club	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1946	Queens; Carnivals	The print depicts the Queen of Mardi Gras while at the parade gallery of the Boston Club. The youthful Queen surrounded by her court, holds a traditional bouquet.	This lithograph was printed by the artist and is included among those in her "Mardi Gras Series.. The print done on stone, was drawn using lithographic pencil. Ms.  Durieux saw this particular Queen and considered the young girl not only to be chic but clever. The choice of the smart-looking, wide-brim hat made the young lady obvious and she stood out from the crowd. Ms. Durieux was also intrigued by the repetition of the circular device, as noted in the bouquet and repeated in the hat.

the crowd	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1942	Crowds	The work was done during the midst of World War II and depicts a sea of depressed, haggard, gaunt male and female faces. The faces stretch into the background where they meet a clouded horizon. The sad eyes and drawn mouths of the figures in the first rows are especially arresting.	This is an unnumbered printer's proof. Ms. Durieux believes that an edition of ten was printed although it is not listed in the Lamey Catalogue of Caroline Durieux's Graphic Works.

Priests	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1932	Priests	The inspiration for this composition came during a trip to Santiago do Chile. While visiting the city, the artist was fascinated with the quick-moving "flocks" of priests who moved along the streets. She felt they resembled flocks of blackbirds darting along in their groups. Ms. Durieux quickly sketched the initial plan for the print upon returning to the hotel room. The artist related that although the intention was to suggest the anonymity created by the priests' clerical garb and gestures, she purposely commented on the individuality of each priest's facial features. Each member of the flock is distinctly suggestive of the Indian and Spanish priests seen in the city. This particular print is from the second printing of the design/composition.	This print is from the second lithographic edition ever done by the artist. It was printed in 1932 in Mexico City at the Senefelders.	4 of10	Image	Black lithograph	10-5/8 x 14 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Solar creatures	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Abstract paintings	The "Creature" were created from the imagination of the artist and are3 abstracted forms which seem to float throughout the composition.	This is a three color lithograph with an overprinting of a whitish-green. The colors used are yellow-grey, blue-green, and red. The drawing was made using lithographic crayon with brush and ink. The crayon allows for the texturing of the central massing of the picture plane. Ms. Durieux stated that this texturing creates a warm feeling to her and the use of warm red throughout the composition suggests to her the warmth of the solar system.	4 of 15	Image	Color lithograph	14 x 19-1/2 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

New Orleans jazz	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1966	Jazz; New Orleans, La; Music	A curvilinear outlined form is superimposed over the background. The central mass is worked in shades of red as are smaller spiral forms, one of which is appears in each quadrant of the print. The background is a red ground color with an over-printing of green-blue spots. The darkest of the outlines are the result of printing all the colors over and together in these areas. In order to deepen the color and emphasize the areas, an overprinting of blue is used. The larger forms create a movement up and down within the composition.	This is a color electron print printed with the three primary colors only. The print is worked from top to bottom in blue-green stripes with touches of yellow. The artist noted that the work loses the effect of a happy rhythm when the composition is turned upside down.

Medusa afraid	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1956	Medusa; Women	Ms. Durieux related that the subject represents Medusa, which she feels man always associates with fright. She feels the print suggested the mood of fright, an emotion many shared during the 1950's when man was aware of the growing horror the atomic bomb was capable of creating.	This is an electron print made by the artist at LSU using the isotope Sulfur 35. Dr. Olan Nance served as her assistant for the printing of this edition. A rough fibered paper  deliberately used in order for the print to reproduce the textured patterning of these fibers in the final print. The initial drawing was made with a wash of radioactive ink with lines applied using pen and ink.

Death masker, Mardi Gras day	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1946	Skulls; Skeletons	The print depicts a Carnival masker who has chosen death as his motif.	This lithograph was printed at LSU and is included among those in her "Mardi Gras Series." It was drawn using a lithographic pencil on stone.

Juggler	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Abstract paintings	The Juggler's form is created by bold wide lines, lines which express the lithe movement of the Juggle's action.	Print was made by using a thick lithographic crayon and brush and lithographic ink. The three colors used are a light bluish-grey, green and yellow. Ms. Durieux commented that the artist  always has a color gratis, that is, the actual color of the paper with which to include in the color planning of a print. In this print the white of the paper serves as accent areas throughout the composition.	6 of 15	Image	Color lithograph	19-1/2 x 14-3/8 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.

Two of a kind	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1953	Women; Portraits	The print depicts a study of two elderly faces. Both appear to be female and seem quite alert and active.The colors used were green, blue, and flesh. It was these inks which when rolled up on the drawing of the stone gave the final color print. The drawing itself was made using lithographic pencil and scraping. The artist activates the entire composition by her use of a quick short staccato-type lines which move quickly across the surface. These lines create delicate tonal areas throughout the faces. By using a variation in the actual thickness of contour lines, the artist creates a feeling of spatial environment  for the characters.

Underwater	Durieux, Caroline, 1896-1989	1957	Abstract paintings	The artist commented that the scene represents various debris often found drifting and floating in water. The subject matter related to a favorite pastime of the artist, the sea-side and water related activities. Ms. Durieux stated that sea-forms have always fascinated her and such allows for an interesting patterning within the picture plane.	The colors used are green-grey, pinkish-grey, brownish grey, and a thick bluish white. The drawing was made by the artist using a lithographic pencil with lithographic ink and brush. The artist allows the white of the paper to serve as additional color in the print, thus white shapes are created simply by not printing over these areas	4 of 15	Image	Color lithograph	19 x 15-1/2 in.	jpeg 2000	Louisiana State University Museum of Art (http://appl003.lsu.edu/museum/moa.nsf/index/)	Finding aid for the original photographs: http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/d3827.html	Physical rights are retained by the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.
