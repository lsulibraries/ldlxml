Marquis de Mondion to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1781 Apr. 03	1781-04-03	Charles Laurent Marquis de Mondion, Seigneur de Beaupré, Béziers, France, writes Joseph Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, to tell him that the extract that Duplantier sent from Du Chatelet [sic.]’s letter concerning Antoine Trénonay's death is not sufficient for the regiment’s needs and that a notarized death certificate must be sent instead.  He asserts that Mr. Champoleon will write concerning Duplantier’s late brother-in-law's possessions, and he recommends going through Minister of the Navy Charles-Eugène-Gabriel de la Croix, Marquis de Castries, when responding to Mr. du Chatelet [du Chastelet] in St. Vincent.  De Mondion speculates that the addressee's son is in Boston and mentions the Count de Nieul in closing.	Beaupré, Charles Laurent Marquis de Mondion, seigneur de.

Concitoyen Desvignes Cousin to Monsieur Pascal, 1792 Nov. 02	1792-11-02	Concitoyen Desvignes Cousin, Lyon, France, provides Monsieur Pascal, Voiron, France, an excerpt from Jacques [Tournier? Tourine?]’s July 18, 1792, letter from New Orleans describing Claude Trénonay's death.  The quote states that the victim was supping with his manager, his surgeon, and his business manager when one of his male slaves, spying through a window, shot Trénonay dead without saying a word.  The account relates that the slave escaped but returned to his cabin the following night and hung himself.  The statement records that the presence of accomplices is not known.  The value of Trénonay's estate is given and reference is made to the deceased’s brother in Paris (who was 'trésorier du Receveur des Finances') and 'another [brother] in Dauphiné with a sister.'  Below the writer's signature appears 'ancien hôtel d’artois #8.'	Cousin, Desvignes.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Eduvige Allard Duplantier, 1799 July 27	1799-07-27	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, writes his sister, Eduvige Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, in a duplicate letter containing 'éduvige allard' in the address on the back.  He announces the birth of a daughter and recounts plans to swap children between his siblings in France.  In expressing concerns for his children's future, the writer describes himself as gray-haired, without much energy, and the same height as two of his sons, who still have not had a good education.  Duplantier considers his sons fit only for the plantations, which slavery especially renders troublesome.  He also brings up other hardships of fatherhood and marriage.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827--Family.; French--Family relationships--Louisiana.; Colonists--Family relationships--Louisiana.; Boys--Louisiana--Social conditions.	Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.		http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Eduvige Allard Duplantier, 1802 Jan. 28	1802-01-28	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, consoles his sister, Eduvige Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, following their father's death, reassuring her that he intends to return to France with his children.  He briefly discusses property at Falque and La Rochette, France.  Duplantier defends his intentions of remarrying, speaking at length and favorably of both his late wife and his current female interest, a Mobile Creole.  The writer alludes to bad news concerning 'the dear little girl' ('la chère petite') and to Gariot's reporting that she was well.  The addresser tells the addressee of his daughter, 'I think you will have much trouble keeping her for your little Joseph.  Creole girls born in a hot country are precocious, and I fear she is becoming impatient.  That will be your affair!'  Duplantier mentions the 'Pennaillon' [sic.] and his Aunt Allard in the postscript.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Eduvige Allard Duplantier, 1802 May 31	1802-05-31	Armand Allard Duplantier, announces to his sister, Eduvige Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, that he is sending his sons Armand (age 17) and Guy to France with Dr. Giovellina.  He states that he has inoculated Guy as well as his daughter against smallpox.  Duplantier repeatedly refers to his brother, Guy, as 'Allard.'  He relates the effect that the uncertainty of the colony's future governance is having on Louisiana.  The addresser states that he is still undecided about remarrying.  In a postscript, he sends his regards to the 'Penaillon,' inquiring about the latter and asking, 'Is he still lazy like a monk?'	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.		http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Eduvige Allard Duplantier, 1802 Sept. 15	1802-09-15	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, announces to his sister, Eduvige Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, that he has married the Widow Joyce, about whom he had been speaking in letters.  He talks favorably of her and his late wife, and he voices hopes for their blended family.  The writer expresses an interest in living at Falque, France, where his wife could learn household-management skills from the recipient.  Duplantier comments, 'The Creoles in general don't know much [about running a household], and the European way of life and that of here are so different that a Creole woman would find herself very embarrassed there!'  The writer speaks of his daughter and of his second wife's two children, a son ready for 'college' and a 13-year-old daughter.  The addresser speculates that his sons Armand and Guy must be with the addressee, and he shows particular concern for the elder's adapting to European life.  Duplantier sends his regards to the 'penaillon' and to female Cousin Faure.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Eduvige Allard Duplantier, 1804 June 21	1804-06-21	Armand Allard Duplantier addresses his sister, Eduvige Allard Duplantier, at Le Plantier in Voiron, France.  He states his hopes that Poignand [Poignaud?] will bring a portrait of the Duplantiers' father when he returns to Louisiana, as the man is to accompany the writer's oldest son, Fergus, to Le Plantier before continuing to Grenoble.  The addresser expresses his feelings over finally sending his oldest son to France and hopes that Dupuy will be able to instruct him.  Duplantier refers to his first daughter's stepmother and black nanny as 'her white mother and her black mother,' and he announces that he has a second daughter as well.  He indicates that he is expecting another child (which he believes will be a girl) and that his brother ('Allard') has two sons.  He extends his best to Mme. Faure.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Eduvige Allard Duplantier, 1822 Apr. 25	1822-04-25	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, tells his sister, Eduvige Allard Duplantier, that he has received her letter, care of Bernard, announcing their brother's death.  The addresser states his satisfaction over his sister's being with their sister-in-law, nephews, and niece.  He relates that the sons from his first marriage, excepting Fergus, are in other locations, pursuing agriculture, and the children of his second marriage, four boys and a girl, are still with him, pursuing their education.  He notes that his oldest daughter has finished her schooling in New Orleans and is helping her stepmother with the household.  Duplantier relates that she resembles her paternal and not maternal family, and he expresses concerns over being able to marry her well in Louisiana.  The writer states that he is neither happy nor well (especially because of some family troubles) and that he no longer deserves the nickname 'Gradouble.'  He states that because of losses occasioned by a cotton disease, he had to sell his wife's properties to cover expenses.  He comments on the local economy, refers to problems locals are having with government recognition of their land titles, and expresses the hope that Congress will resolve the latter.  In a postscript, he sends his regards to Nanette Rocha and Mr. Colon.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.		http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Eduvige Duplantier, 1796 June 18	1796-06-18	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, writes his sister, Eduvige Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France.  He says that he has not heard from the family and, therefore, is worried that something may have happened to them during the Revolution, especially as others in Louisiana have been receiving news from their families since peace was declared between France and Spain.  Duplantier reports on his wife and three sons.  In the postscript, he refers to 'Le penaillon,' saying that Louisiana is excellent for monks and that immigrant priests have been employed there.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, 1803 Aug. 06	1803-08-06	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, sends a duplicate letter to his sister-in-law, Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, at Le Plantier, Voiron, France.  He acknowledges receiving her letter care of her brother Hippolyte Tivollier and says that the latter has recuperated from a fever following the transatlantic journey.  The writer admits that the summer heat and the local economy have made Tivollier want to return to France, but the former hopes the latter will give the colony some time before departing.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1793 May 25	1793-05-25	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, to say that his son and a shipment of indigo will not be sailing to France as planned.  He comments on the war, on what is going on in France and in Louisiana, and on the reunification of the two places.  He suggests mailing through Bordeaux, care of Lille Sarpy, who is associated with 'Les frères Cambon et Compagnie' or Barrière, who has dealings with 'Henry et Gros, Négociants.'   Noting that Mme. Guimard has sent Messrs. Faure, Gariot, and 'Blan chirugien' (Blanc) her procuration in Claude Trénonay's succession, Duplantier speaks unfavorably of both Blanc and his late uncle Claude Trénonay.  He reveals knowing that the latter tried to paint a bad picture of Duplantier to their relatives.  The writer asserts that whereas Trénonay made himself generally detested in Louisiana, Duplantier has won the respect and friendship of honest colonists.  The addresser alludes to a letter that his wife, Augustine, wrote to his mother that gives more of an idea of Trénonay's character.  Duplantier extends his regards to 'la petite [Barbeto? Baubeto?] mentioned in the postscript of his March 18, 1781, letter and to Eduvige.  He describes his eldest son's rough personality and appearance, offering Gariot's remark that the boy resembles Eduvige.  Duplantier jokes that if he did not know that 'Penaillon' was such a good patriot, he would have him come to Louisiana, where the Capuchins play an important role.  He sends his best to 'Tante Allard' in the postscript.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1795 Jan. 10	1795-01-10	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, to say that the colony has heard of peace being declared.  He expresses his hope that more ships and news from France will be the result.  He discusses Claude Trénonay's succession, referring again to a will that should have been found in Mr. Bilion's office.  He speaks about indigo and the slave situation, referring to the planned Pointe Coupée rebellion and the insurrection in St. Domingue.  Duplantier states that because of the war, he had opted for sending his sons to the northern United States for schooling, but now he hopes again to send them to France.  In a postscript, the addresser warns that the recipient should not write about the French Revolution if the mail is to pass by way of Spain.   Duplantier suggests writing through Madame 'Mercié' in Bordeaux and Sarpy in New Orleans.  He ends by stating the types of garden seeds he would like to have sent to him.  [A duplicate of this letter in the Duplantier (Armand) Letters, Mss. 4914, gives 1796 as the year.]	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1797 Sept. 05	1797-09-05	Armand Allard Duplantier writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, a triplicate letter, saying he has received a letter from the recipient care of Sarpy and another care of Allard's son.  He expresses his relief that the family has survived the French Revolution as well as his regret at being financially unable to send his two oldest sons to France.  He discusses education in Louisiana and refers to the dissatisfaction that locals experience when they send their children to the northern United States for schooling.  The writer mentions that the recipient is married and that another war is occurring.  He refers to the letter from Gabrielle Trénonay Duplantier that the late Claude Trénonay kept from Augustine Gérard Duplantier and mentions a letter from Augustine to Gabrielle that explains Augustine and Armand Duplantier’s separation from Trénonay.  The addresser elaborates upon Trénonay's flaws, stressing how the late uncle was greedy, detested, and vengeful toward Duplantier and others.  Duplantier discusses Trénonay's succession and refers again to the probable will made in 1765 or 1766.  The writer relates troubles that farmers are having with high waters and with indigo, asserting that he is switching to cotton.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1798 June 02	1798-06-02	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, stating that he has received a letter from the addressee care of Sarpy.  He mentions again a previous letter that came through another Allard's son.  In the postscript, he says that he has befriended this Allard, and he speaks of the son's unhappiness in the colony.  The writer expresses his surprise at learning that the will that he had been encouraging his family to find is in favor of Mademoiselle Nardy and not his mother.  He states that this discovery is new proof of Claude Trénonay's capriciousness and lying.  Duplantier states that Sarpy has not received the procurations that the recipient supposedly sent him but has received something from Mr. Faure.  The addresser refers to the Prévieux family again in reference to Trénonay's succession.  He briefly talks about indigo, slaves, and cotton.  Duplantier expresses his regrets upon hearing that his sister-in-law's second pregnancy fared no better than the first, and he relates that he and his wife lost a daughter born two months previously.  The writer says he would like to swap one of his sons for a daughter that the recipient might have.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1801 June 05	1801-06-05	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, advises his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, on proceedings in Claude Trénonay's succession.  The writer suggests sending correspondence through Daniel Cox in Philadelphia.  The addresser also informs the recipient that 'there is a Creole from this country who is staying in Paris with his family, Mr. Pontalba, and the widow of a former governor of Louisiana, his aunt, Madame Miro.'  Duplantier recommends Pontalba as a conveyor of correspondence as well.  The writer expresses the hope that the addressee's wife has had better luck with childbirths.  He states that his children are fine and repeats his desire to send them to France, where Eduvige could raise the daughter.  At the bottom of the letter appears:  'Received December 12, 1801.  Answered the 13th.'  Penciled on the back are instructions for the placement of doors and windows in stables and barns with comparisons to outbuildings belonging to Madame Pascal.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1801 March 05, Copy 1	1801-03-05	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, sends his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, a fourth copy of a letter, two copies of which exist in the Duplantier (Armand) Family Letters, Mss. 5060. [A triplicate copy of this letter exists in the Duplantier (Armand) Letters, Mss. 4914.]  The writer repeats news that he said he had written in previous letters, namely that he wrote from New Orleans in 1799 to relate his wife's death there shortly after the birth of their daughter.  He had spoken of yellow fever in the city, his loss of slaves to it, and travel difficulties during the plague.  Duplantier acknowledges having heard of his mother's death.  He continues to discuss Claude Trénonay's succession and repeats his desire to return to France along with his children.  He relates the deaths of the two oldest Messrs. Sarpy and recommends sending correspondence through Mather, Poydras, and Girod, all of whom Duplantier speaks highly.  The addresser outlines plans to help the Prévieux heirs.  He ends with a letter to Nicolas Girod at the Widow St. Jean's in Havre de Grâce.  In it, Duplantier discusses dealings with the Fuselier ('Fusilier') de La Claire families in Louisiana and Lyon and again refers to the deposit that André Masse had left for his sister in Claude Trénonay's hands.  Duplantier tells Girod to send correspondence through Daniel Cox in Philadelphia and Daniel Clark in New Orleans.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1802 Jan. 28	1802-01-28	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, acknowledging the death of their father.  The writer mentions Gariot, Poignand [Poignaud?], Tricou’s boat, and Girod and indicates that the recipient has a child.  Duplantier relates the progress in Claude Trénonay's succession and ongoing plans to return to France.  He discusses cotton, indigo, slaves, and sugar, indicating the move toward cotton and sugar cane as major cash crops in Louisiana.  The addresser describes his attachment to his slaves and his concern for their welfare as some of the reasons for his delay in returning to France.  He speaks of property at Falque, La Rochette, Tullins ('Tulin'), and Le Plantier, France.  In a postscript, Duplantier refers to his cousin Madame Faure, Gariot, Faure, and Louisiana's retrocession to France.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1802 June 03	1802-06-03	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, informs his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, that his sons Armand and Guy are leaving for France with Dr. and Mrs. Giovellina.  The writer provides background on the Giovellinas, alluding to their connections with Joseph Bonaparte and mentioning that they have adopted an orphan that they are taking to France for education.  Duplantier discusses educational arrangements for his sons, investing in a boat, and returning to France.  He continues to refer to the effects that the colony's uncertain future are having on Louisiana.  He states that he has written to Tivollier and recommends sending correspondence through the de l’Arbres in Le Havre and Mr. Mérieult in New Orleans.  At the beginning of the letter, the addresser notes that the addressee is a father, and, at the end, he sends his regards to 'your little Joseph.'  Duplantier says to tell Gariot that Mr. Dorsière has not yet arrived.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1802 Mar. 15	1802-03-15	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France.  He speaks of smallpox in Louisiana, inoculation against it, and the disease's effect on slave sales.  He continues to track the progress in Claude Trénonay's succession and gives information on indigo, cotton, and sugar in Louisiana.  Duplantier relates the economic effect of Louisiana's retrocession to France as well as his plans to send his son Guy to Europe.  The writer repeats his interest in property at Falque and Tullins ('Tulin'), France.  He sends his regards to Eduvige, his aunts Allard and Guimard, Madame Faure, the 'Penaillon,' Fr. Perrin, and the recipient's wife and child.  In the margin, Duplantier adds that Poignand [Poignaud?] has returned to Louisiana and has expressed his regrets at not having been able to see the recipient while in France.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.	French--Family relationships--Louisiana.; Colonists--Family relationships--Louisiana.; Smallpox--Louisiana.; Louisiana--Politics and government--To 1803.	Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1802 May 10	1802-05-10	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier.  [A duplicate of this correspondence exists in the Duplantier (Armand) Letters, Mss. 4914.]  The addresser acknowledges receipt of the addressee's letter sent through Mr. Degrange.  Duplantier speaks of the woman he is considering marrying and confesses that the memory of his first wife is causing him to hesitate entering again into matrimony.  He refers to his brother's marriage, stepson, and child on the way.  The writer indicates the retrocession’s effect on the colony and outlines his plans to leave Louisiana.  He expresses his desire to send his youngest son, Guy, and possibly his second son, Armand, to France with Dr. Louis Giovellina.  Duplantier relates his children's health as well as his views on inoculation.  He requests information on the property at Falque, France, and mentions Girod, Mr. de la Haye, Messrs. Ducret [Ducuet?] and Allegret, Mr. Tivollier, his female cousin Mme. Faure, and Gariot.  Changing from 'tu' to 'vous,' the writer addresses a few words to his sister-in-law and sends his regards to her son.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1802 Nov. 25	1802-11-25	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, sends his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, a letter on the boat La Mexicaine, saying that he has heard of his sons' arrival in France and that he is angry that Armand and Dr. Giovellina did not write upon reaching Le Havre.  Duplantier mentions dealings with Mr. Gachet in Bordeaux, Faure, and Mr. [Guilhempeau?].  He asserts that Louisiana has definitely reverted to French ownership but that the economy will remain stagnant until French government of the colony is re-established.  He affirms that he will try to send funds from Claude Trénonay's succession to France in the spring.  He relates that his little girl (whose name – Augustine – he gives for the first time) and Fergus are fine.  The addresser sends his best to Cousin Faure.  In a postscript, he says to tell Gariot that Dorsière has arrived and that they will talk business when the latter has regained his health.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1802 Sept. 15	1802-09-15	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, informs his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, that the long-awaited procurations for Claude Trénonay's succession have arrived, care of Girod.  The writer relates how he will proceed with the succession, part of which involves the Prévieux family, Girod, de la Haye, and Madame Faure.  Duplantier surmises that his sons Armand and Guy must be with the recipient.  He asks about the boys and refers to the school at Tournon, France, as a possible place for education.  The addresser expresses the confusion concerning who is in possession of Louisiana.  He states that he has married the widow about whom he had been speaking, and he relates that his daughter and his oldest son, Fergus, are fine.  Duplantier speaks of having the addressee's brother-in-law Louis Tivollier send a boatload of merchandise to Louisiana by March, when farmers descend upon New Orleans with their harvests and make purchases.  In a postscript, he refers to business involving Gariot, Dorsière, and Sarpy.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1803 Aug. 06	1803-08-06	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, indicating how war is again presenting problems for Louisiana, for transmitting funds from Claude Trénonay's succession, and for Duplantier’s return to France.  The writer relates that Hippolyte Tivollier (the recipient's brother-in-law) and Perrin had 'the fever.'  He discusses property in the vicinity of Voiron, France, but dismisses Chirens ('Chiran') and Le Grand Souillet ('Soulliet'), as being too cold.  The addresser expresses relief at having received news of his sons in France.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827--Family.; French--Family relationships--Louisiana.; Colonists--Family relationships--Louisiana.; Louisiana--Politics and government--To 1803.	Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1803 Aug. 25	1803-08-25	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, sends a duplicate letter to his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, acknowledging receipt of a letter through Tivollier and one through Gachet.  He discusses the Salomon belonging to Tivollier and Perrin, the ship's merchandise (specifically cotton and dye wood), and the two men's undertakings in Louisiana.  In considering the purchase of properties near Falque and Le Plantier, France, the writer describes 'Mayphrey' near 'Beheque' and the Sieur Gabourd’s association with it.  The addresser also comments upon land held by Mr. de César and by Mr. de Louvat, the latter from St. Jean, France.  He expresses concern over getting succession funds to Madame Trénonay's children.  He reiterates his passion for agriculture and his desire to pursue it in France.  Duplantier states that he is very happy over news from and about his sons in France, indicating that Mr. Dupuy has sent some of it.  Imagining his return to Voiron in the postscript, the addresser comments on how happy he would be to have the 'penaillon' as a pastor in the area.  He also mentions Mme. Faure, stating that her mother is the writer's and recipient's aunt.  He sends his regards to his 'Tante Allard' and to 'L’abbé perin.'	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1803 Feb. 04	1803-02-04	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, expresses to his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, impatience for news of his sons in France.  He mentions sending cotton to France care of Gachet in Bordeaux and Messrs.  de l’Arbre in Le Havre and indicates a growing friendship with Mérieult in New Orleans.  Duplantier continues to comment upon how the local economy is suffering from Louisiana's being between Spanish and French rule.  He conveys his concern for his sons in the postscript and also mentions the 'pennaillon' there.  He closes by speaking of a young Mr. Vauquelin whom the son Armand knows well and who stayed with the Duplantiers at one time.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1804 July 04	1804-07-04	Armand Allard Duplantier writes his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier at Le Plantier, Voiron, France.  He states that his son Fergus must have already reached the recipient and expresses his hopes that Dupuy will be able to take on the young man.  The writer states that Gourrier [Gournier? Gourvier? ] requests information on how his family fared the French Revolution.  On the back appears, 'Forwarded by Otard of Bordeaux September 24, 1804.'	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1805 Apr. 25	1805-04-25	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, addresses a duplicate letter to this brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France.  He says that he has written the recipient through Mr. 'Tureau' [Tuveau?], a young man returning to Marseille who was also conveying a letter for 'Louis.'  Duplantier expresses surprise over hearing about problems that Lefebvre has caused in handing funds over to the addressee, and he wonders if Thebaud has been negligent in this regard.  He refers to a ship from Nantes’ being taken to Jamaica, and, in relation to the affair, he discusses disappointments concerning a trusted young man who had been associated with 'Faurie' [Fauvie?] and who is also involved with 'Louis' and business in Marseille.  In relation to shipments, Duplantier expresses fears concerning 'Algerians.'  The addresser affirms that he is happy over his brother's undertakings with Mr. Samadet.  He says that he has heard from Bird Savage in London in reference to Cazenove, and he conveys Gourrier's [Gournier's? Gourvier's?] regards.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1805 Aug. 25	1805-08-25	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, sends his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, a letter for which the continuation is missing.  He outlines the recipient's assistance in Mr. Bernard's sale of property in Brittany, which also involves Bernard's relative Mr. du Haut-Cilly and a Mr. 'Mesgen' in St. Brieuc, France.  Duplantier refers to getting wine from Otard in Bordeaux and again brings up the Nantes ship detained in Jamaica.  He speaks in greater depth about problems with corsairs.  The addresser refers to a letter from Tivollier in France announcing the death of the latter's father and relates that Hippolyte Tivollier in Louisiana was very affected by the news.  Duplantier discusses placing his son Armand with Tivollier for continued education and training in the latter's profession and mentions his other sons in France, Fergus and Guy, reiterating his concern for the former.  The writer again expresses frustration over the war's preventing his return to France.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

The writer expresses his desire to hunt again with his brother and to have the 'penaillon' as pastor at Chirens, France.  He mentions Hippolyte Tivollier, Perrin, and Gourrier [Gournier? Gourvier?] at the end, saying that the Louisiana winter weather agrees with the first.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1807 June 18	1807-06-18	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, discusses business ventures with his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, residing at Le Plantier, Voiron, France.  [A duplicate containing reference to François and Hippolyte Tivollier and to Yves Perrin that are omitted from the present version exists in the Duplantier (Armand) Letters, Mss. 4914.]  On the back appears in another hand:  'Mr. de Sarpi of New Orleans and my brother.'

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1785 Apr. 12	1785-04-12	Armand Allard Duplantier, Pointe Coupée, addresses his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, announcing that he has two sons, the elder eighteen months old and the younger three months old.  Duplantier boasts that the older, more robust, promises to merit the writer's nickname, 'Gradouble.'  The addresser makes brief references to his indigo- and slave-based finances and to having sent his wife to New Orleans for childbirth.  Duplantier says that while in New Orleans, he made the acquaintance of a Mr. Allard, also from Dauphiné [who could possibly be the Mr. Allard mentioned in some of Claude Trénonay's letters].  Duplantier says that he has had a portrait of his wife and elder son made and that he hopes Mr. Allard will take it to the writer's family in France while en route to Grenoble.

His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1787 Feb. 03	1787-02-03	Armand Allard Duplantier, Pointe Coupée, writes his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, indicating that the latter has received the portrait described in the author's April 12, 1785, letter, and that the Mr. Allard mentioned in the same is from Remollon, France.  The writer relates having lost a son in childbirth and elaborates upon his wife's ill health.  He gives the names and birth information of his two surviving children as Fergus, born October 8, 1783, at Pointe Coupée, and Armand, born January 11, 1785, in New Orleans.  He states the reasons for wanting to send his wife and children to France and confesses not knowing that his father was 66 years old.  Duplantier affirms that his uncle Trénonay did not give him the plantation on which he resides, which was what the writer's other uncle, 'Lagoyête,' had told the addressee.  The addresser asserts that 'Mr. de lacize' [Nicolas de Lassize], commandant of the Pointe Coupée post, has said that he did not give 'Lagoyête' such information.  Duplantier points out that the plantation belonged to his wife's grandfather and that the writer bought it after the latter's death.  Duplantier says that he will try to have a portrait of himself done the next time that he is in New Orleans so as to send it and one of his younger sons to his parents.  He likewise requests portraits of his parents and discusses the seeds sent to him from Europe.  In closing, the addresser indicates that Fergus is called 'Plauton' because Duplantier remembers hearing that the recipient was given the same nickname when he was the child's age.  The writer extends his regards to a priest and a monk ('Mr. Le curé' and a 'penaillon').  He advises sending correspondence through the Brunaud brothers in Bordeaux, as they conduct business with Julien Poydras.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1792 Aug. 02	1792-08-02	Armand Allard Duplantier, Pointe Coupée, informs his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, of Claude Trénonay's gunshot murder by a slave on July 12.  He relates that the slave fired through the dining-room window while the victim was finishing dinner and later hung himself.  In the absence of a will, Duplantier states that he nominated Ricard de Rieutord to represent the deceased’s heirs.  The writer affirms that Ricard had been Trénonay's friend for 26 years and suggests that the nominee's was the only friendship the victim managed to keep.  The addresser states that there should be a 1765 or 1766 will at the late Mr. Bilion's law office in Voiron, France.  Duplantier states that his wife is doing better since he has established a new plantation at Baton Rouge and that they have a third son, who is fifteen months old.  He explains some of the details concerning successions in Louisiana.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1792 Dec. 01	1792-12-01	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, continues instructing his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, on Claude Trénonay's succession.  He states that he will return to Pointe Coupée to run Trénonay's plantation with a manager, as he has placed a similar person on his own plantation, where the small number of slaves is easy to handle.  Duplantier discusses indigo and slaves, indicating that Trénonay was hard on the latter.  He explains that he will intervene on behalf of a mulatto woman to whom his late uncle had promised freedom and that he would also like to keep together two slave families originating from the time of his great-uncle.  The writer mentions dealings involving Mr. Faure, 'Mr. Blan' the surgeon (Joseph Etienne Blanc), André Gariot, and Mr. Ricard.  He recounts family illnesses and his plans to send wife and children to France.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1793 Feb. 20	1793-02-20	Armand Allard Duplantier, Pointe Coupée, writes his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, discussing indigo, slaves, and the status of his holdings.  He mentions that the Englishman who had been with his late uncle is now with the writer.  He relates preparations to send his oldest son to France and reiterates his wife's fear of crossing the ocean, a subject discussed in previous letters.  In the postscript, the addresser extends his regards to 'Le penaillon.'	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1793 May 05	1793-05-05	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, addresses his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, recounting that he had gone to New Orleans with his son and the indigo from his uncle's succession, only to find that war had halted ships' sailing to France.  He states that he has stored the indigo in the city and that communication will likely pass through New England or Spain.  He reports that relatives have written James Mather ('Matter') and Julien Poydras concerning Claude Trénonay's succession.  Duplantier relates that Americans have been allowed to conduct business in Louisiana.  He says that André Gariot was going to accompany the writer's son to France and that 'Plauton' is mad over the war's preventing the journey.  In the postscript, Duplantier asks to be remembered to 'my old pastor the Abbé Perrin.'	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1793 May 24	1793-05-24	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, writes his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, care of Messrs. Lille Sarpy and Barrière.  He reports on the 'sad situation of this colony,' which he says has suffered for eighteen months under the Baron de Carondelet, whom the author compares to Alejandro O’Reilly.  Duplantier complains about the governor's policies concerning slaves and free colonists and argues that most Louisianians want to be reunited with France.  The writer enumerates the advantages that France would gain in reacquiring Louisiana, and he describes the growing American presence in the region.  At the same time, he comments on French internal politics.  He relates that his Guimard aunt has sent her procuration to Mr. 'Blan' (Joseph Etienne Blanc) and Mr. Gariot.  He suggests sending mail through the Cambon brothers in Bordeaux, Lille Sarpy, Messrs. Henry and Gros, and Barrière.  He closes by listing the types of seeds he would like to have sent to him.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1796 June 21	1796-06-21	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, updates his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, on the status of Claude Trénonay's succession and reiterates his desire to take his family to France.  He refers again to a will that Trénonay made in 1765 or 1766 that must be in the late Mr. Bilion's office.  He mentions Prévieux's involvement in the succession as well as the money that Trénonay had deposited for Miss Masse of Paris.  The writer speaks angrily of discovering that Trénonay had hidden a letter from Gabrielle Trénonay Duplantier to Augustine Gérard Duplantier.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.	Trénonay, Jean Claude, d. 1792--Estate.	Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.	1726-1801: Jean Claude Trénonay's brother-in-law and father to Armand Duplantier.  ‘Allard’ served in the Chambre de Députés after the French Revolution as the deputy from Dauphiné and Isère.	http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1796 Mar. 07	1796-03-07	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, informs his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, of troubles he is having with Claude Trénonay's succession.  He mentions a sum of money that the late André Masse in Louisiana had entrusted to Claude Trénonay for Masse's sister in Paris.  As Miss Masse was aged, Duplantier, fearing she is also deceased, asks his father to locate heirs.  The writer briefly discusses indigo.  He relates that he is mailing his letter through Captain [Meroue? Merone?] via Marseille and asks that that route be used to send him garden seeds.  He also requests magazines, books, and literature on the French Revolution, as he says the Spanish government has started allowing such things to enter the colony.  Affixed to Duplantier’s letter is one dated June 19, 1796, Marseille, from« Meӱnaud [Meӱraud?] coming from the Mississippi, Province of Louisiana - in America. »  It is addressed to 'Monsieur' and states that it is accompanying a letter that 'Mr. Duplantier' asked the writer to convey.  The author expresses his hope that the Revolution has not harmed the recipient and states that the likelihood of war between Spain and England prevents him from assuring when he may be returning to Louisiana.  He gives his address as being with Citizen Robin.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.	Trénonay, Jean Claude, d. 1792--Estate.; France--History--Revolution, 1789-1799.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1804 Jan. 20	1804-01-20	Armand Allard Duplantier, Baton Rouge, tells his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, about the capture of Mérieult's ship [Le Fame?].  The writer, who had cotton on the vessel, says he learned of the event through American newspapers and Mr. de l’Arbre and that Bird Savage in London and Mr. Porteau will look into the seizure.  He also mentions James Cazenove's involvement on the part of Louis Tivollier in the affair.  Duplantier speaks of purchasing 'Meyphrey' (which he spelled as 'Mayphrey' in his August 25, 1803, letter).  He mentions changes due to occur from Louisiana's transfer to the United States, expresses impatience for new rule, and voices frustration over the effects that switches in government have had on the local economy.  He states that Hippolyte Tivollier and Perrin are at his plantation and gives updates on their projects.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Duplantier, Jr., to Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, 1822 Apr. 20	1822-04-20	Armand Duplantier, Jr., St. James Parish, Acadia County, expresses to his aunt Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, his sorrow upon hearing of the death of his uncle, Guy Allard Duplantier, from Léon Bernard.  The addresser indicates along with his father in the latter's April 25, 1822, letter that Bernard conveys correspondence and other items between the Louisiana and French sides of the writer's family.  Duplantier expresses his desire to correspond with Joseph and Guy.  He states that he has three living children, having lost his first son, Allard, two and a half years previously when the baby was six months old.  The writer relates that he gave his second son, nineteen months old, the same name.  He indicates that his two oldest children are girls aged eleven and nine years old and that he has a teacher living with him so as to educate the daughters before his eyes.  Duplantier sends his regards to his aunt Eduvige Allard Duplantier in closing.	Duplantier, Armand, 1785-1862.

His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.

He gives his address as Rue Neuve St. Marc, No. 3, and states that he has placed his daughter with Madame d’Aubrée, Rue du Harlay, No. 9, in the Marais of Paris.  He relates that the best Parisian doctors assure him that his daughter may be cured of curvature of the spin within two years.

Armand Duplantier, Jr., to Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, 1826 Aug. 26	1826-08-26	Armand Duplantier, Jr., Paris, writes his aunt Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, Vorion, France.  He indicates that both addresser and addressee have not received all of the letters that they have sent each other, a problem that almost everyone in the family consistently voices.  Duplantier states that he has heard of the recipient through his father and his brother Guy.  The writer expresses his pleasure upon knowing that his female cousin will be marrying a Tivollier, the addressee's brother's son.  Duplantier echoes his father's April 25, 1822, letter when speaking of problems that Louisianians are having with the United States' failure to recognize Spanish land grants, and he expresses the hope shared by his father that Congress will clear up the matter.  The addresser indicates that Hippolyte Tivollier is the addressee's nephew and that he is no longer associated with 'P….' [Perrin?] but with Mayer in Baton Rouge.  Duplantier reports that of his brothers, Fergus has been married for a long time but without children and that Guy has been married for six years to a relative.  The writer goes on to say that Guy has a brickyard near New Orleans and four children.  He speaks glowingly of his own wife and gives frank appraisals of his four children.  He states that his older daughter, fifteen years and four months old, is named Célestine.  He describes her appearance and qualities and relates that she is fluent in spoken and written French and English.  He describes the appearance of his second daughter, Louise, as well, noting that she is thirteen years old and in Paris.  He notes that his sons are six and three.  Duplantier suggests sending mail through Henry in Le Havre and Fortin in New Orleans.	Duplantier, Armand, 1785-1862.

Augustine Eulalie Duplantier to Eduvige Allard Duplantier, 1818 Apr. 09	1818-04-09	Augustine Eulalie Duplantier, Baton Rouge, writes her aunt Eduvige Allard Duplantier.  She says that her brother Guy has spoken much of their relatives in France and that she has asked him to ask their uncle for a copy of their mother's portrait.  She states that her Aunt Favrot has asked for a copy as well.  The writer remarks that a portrait from her mother's adolescence and descriptions of her from other people are the only things that help her form an image of someone she lost when just a baby.  The addresser also requests a portrait of the addressee.  Augustine Duplantier’s father, Armand Allard Duplantier, adds his own letter to the bottom of his daughter's.  He states that he regrets not having been able to send his daughter to France or return there himself.  He asserts that Mr. Le Bourgeois, who is going to Lyon, could be put in charge of the portrait of his daughter's mother.  Duplantier affirms that he and his sons think his second daughter, Euphémie, resembles the addressee, and he avows that the girl will be writing her aunt.	Duplantier, Augustine Eulalie, 1799-1864.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Guy Allard Duplantier, 1801 March 05, Copy 2	1801-03-05	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, sends his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, one of four known copies of a letter, two copies of which exist in the Duplantier (Armand) Family Letters, Mss. 5060. [A triplicate copy of this letter exists in the Duplantier (Armand) Letters, Mss. 4914.]  The writer repeats news that he said he had written in previous letters, namely that he wrote from New Orleans in 1799 to relate his wife's death there shortly after the birth of their daughter.  He had spoken of yellow fever in the city, his loss of slaves to it, and travel difficulties during the plague.  Duplantier acknowledges having heard of his mother's death.  He continues to discuss Claude Trénonay's succession and repeats his desire to return to France along with his children.  He relates the deaths of the two oldest Messrs. Sarpy and recommends sending correspondence through Mather, Poydras, and Girod, all of whom Duplantier speaks highly.  The addresser outlines plans to help the Prévieux heirs.  He ends with a letter to Nicolas Girod at the Widow St. Jean's in Havre de Grâce.  In it, Duplantier discusses dealings with the Fuselier ('Fusilier') de La Claire families in Louisiana and Lyon and again refers to the deposit that André Masse had left for his sister in Claude Trénonay's hands.  Duplantier tells Girod to send correspondence through Daniel Cox in Philadelphia and Daniel Clark in New Orleans.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Armand Allard Duplantier to Gabrielle Trénonay Duplantier, 1783 Apr. 23	1783-04-23	Armand Allard Duplantier, Pointe Coupée, writes his mother, Gabrielle Trénonay Duplantier, declaring that Mr. Maxan, through whom correspondence passed, was taken to Jamaica as prisoner.  The writer repeats information sent earlier, as it seems his letters have not all reached intended recipients.  He says that he came to Louisiana in April 1781, whereas Claude Trénonay's March 30, 1781, letter indicates a March arrival.  Duplantier mentions having married his uncle's stepdaughter and praises her good qualities.  He attests to having heard of the death of his uncle 'Montfera' and relates the loss of his first child shortly after her birth.  The addresser states that his wife is pregnant and that they would like the addressee to be the godmother and to supply the newborn's name.  Duplantier speaks favorably of Louisiana but says the colony needs peace in order to sell indigo at good prices.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.

Armand Duplantier, Jr., to Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, 1839 July 15	1839-07-15	Armand Duplantier, Jr., St. James Parish, writes his cousin Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France.  He relates an encounter in New Orleans with a former insect collector, who gave valuable advice on conservation and handed over some mounting pins.  The writer states that he is sending an insect package to the recipient care of Léon Bernard, but he is foregoing procuring reptiles.  In the postscript, he asks for news about Messrs. Turquin, Pascal, [?], and 'Guilhermose.'	Duplantier, Armand, 1785-1862.	Insects--Collection and preservation--Louisiana.	Armand Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Jr.') was the second surviving son of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier and Augustine Gérard Duplantier.  In 1802, his parents sent him to France for his education, although at age 17 he was considered too old to be going to school.  His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.  He returned to France briefly in 1826 with his ailing daughter Louise to seek medical attention for her.  Despite his solicitude, she died in 1841.

Armand Duplantier, Jr., to Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, 1839 May 19	1839-05-19	Armand Duplantier, Jr., St. James Parish, addresses his cousin Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, whom he calls 'Allard.'  The writer congratulates the recipient upon marrying and expresses his condolences over the death of Rose, a beloved maid at Le Plantier, France.  In fondly recalling Le Plantier, the addresser describes the garden and fountain there.  Duplantier relates that his eldest daughter, Célestine, married a French doctor, Mr. Daret, in 1838 and has a five-month-old son.  He says that his daughter Louise is not married and that his other daughter, Euphémie, is ten years old.  He adds that his two sons, Charles and Edouard, are at a college three leagues away.  The writer goes on to say that Fergus and 'Jaïs' are still at Baton Rouge, Fergus without children and Jaïs 'still a boy.'  He adds that Fergus has adopted two sons of the writer's half-sister, Euphémie, who died 12 years previously.  Duplantier states that his full-sister, Augustine (Madame Favrot), has a son and a daughter, the latter of whom has just married.  Of his half-brothers, he says that all are married and live near their mother in Baton Rouge.  The addresser notes that his late full-brother, Guy, left eight children, the oldest of whom, Amélie, has left for France with her aunt, Madame Avart.  He asserts that he will send the addressee some insect and reptile specimens and asks for something from Le Plantier in return.  He sends his best to Mr. Tivollier in closing.

Armand Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Jr.') was the second surviving son of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier and Augustine Gérard Duplantier.  In 1802, his parents sent him to France for his education, although at age 17 he was considered too old to be going to school.  His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.  He returned to France briefly in 1826 with his ailing daughter Louise to seek medical attention for her.  Despite his solicitude, she died in 1841.  Armand also lost his son Charles to the scarlet fever epidemic of 1859.  Armand, Jr., died in 1862 at age 77, a short time after his plantation had been looted by Union Soldiers during the Civil War.		http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.

Armand Duplantier, Jr., to Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, 1841 Dec. 20	1841-12-20	Armand Duplantier, Jr., St. James Parish, tells his cousin Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, that Améle Duplantier, returning to Louisiana, has brought the recipient's news.  The addresser expresses sorrow upon learning about the addressee's wife's accident.  He relates that his daughter Louise died the previous November 17 and describes her expiration.  Duplantier addresses questions his cousin has about Spanish land grants mentioned in Armand, Sr.'s April 25, 1822, letter and the writer's own August 26, 1826, letter (which he mistakenly attributes to 1825) and offers reasons for his delay in responding.  The addresser describes the roles of Mr. de Lassize (Mme. Avart's brother) and Mr. de Marigny (both men 'personally known by Louis-Philippe, your king') in rallying on behalf of 'all the old French families of Louisiana' in the land matter.  He expresses frustration and pessimism over the United States government's handling of the property issue.  He accuses the government of prejudice against Louisiana-French Creoles and cites two laws designed to populate the state with Anglos and diminish the prominence of Creoles.  He relates how the discrimination has caused him to have to work hard all his life and come to the aid of others, rendering him far less affluent than persons such as Mme. de Castellino think him to be.  In closing, the addresser refers to a package of insects sent to the addressee through Perret.	Duplantier, Armand, 1785-1862.

Armand Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Jr.') was the second surviving son of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier and Augustine Gérard Duplantier.  In 1802, his parents sent him to France for his education, although at age 17 he was considered too old to be going to school.  His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.  He returned to France briefly in 1826 with his ailing daughter Louise to seek medical attention for her.  Despite his solicitude, she died in 1841.  Armand also lost his son Charles to the scarlet fever epidemic of 1859.  Armand, Jr., died in 1862 at age 77, a short time after his plantation had been looted by Union Soldiers during the Civil War.		http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.

Amélie Duplantier to Antoine Allard Duplantier, 1840 Aug. 27	1840-08-27	Amélie Duplantier, Barèges, France, addresses her cousin Antoine Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, as « uncle. »  She says the more sulphuric waters at Barèges have helped her aunt.  She relates that they will be travelling to Voiron via Tarbes and Toulouse and that they would like to visit Switzerland and Italy before returning to Louisiana in the spring.  She offers a travelling spot to either the recipient or to 'Uncle' Séraphin.  Duplantier adds that while her 'Uncle Tivollier' might not be able to make the trip because of his occupations, the addressee would find Italy interesting because of his interest in insect hunting.  The writer asserts that she is glad that 'Aunt' Henriette is better after having been to the thermal baths, and, in sending best wishes, she mentions her 'Aunt Allard.'

Amélie Duplantier to Antoine Allard Duplantier, 1840 July 30	1840-07-30	Amélie Duplantier, Cauterets, France, addresses her cousin Antoine Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, as 'uncle.'  She says that a Parisian doctor recommended that her accompanying aunt visit the Cauterets baths, and she reports that the latter, while still suffering in the shoulder, can make some movements that were previously impossible.  Duplantier says that she is sorry to hear about the sickness of 'Tante Henriette' [Henriette Paris d’Avancourt de Treffonds, wife of Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, and, therefore, actually the addresser's cousin-in-law].  Duplantier states that she hopes the waters at Uriage, France, will have the same effects on Henriette as the baths at Cauterets had on the writer.  She relates having seen Chartres, Tours, Bordeaux, and Pau, France, on the way to Cauterets, adding that she and her travelling aunt are enchanted by the beautiful mountains.  She recounts that they saw the Lac de Gaube, the Cascade du Ceriset, and the Pont d’Espagne, but not yet the Vallée de Campan, France.  She expresses the hope that her aunt will let her visit Marseille and Switzerland before returning to Paris and notes that her mother is anxious for her to return to Louisiana.  Among those to whom she sends her regards are 'Uncle Séraphin' and 'my little Isabelle.'	Peniston, Amélie Duplantier, 1821-1845.

She says that she has received news of her 'Uncle Antoine' through Mr. Albin, and she expresses her wish that her male cousin would come to Paris for treatment.  In describing a ball that she attended, the writer states that even though it was supposed to be one of the most beautiful in Paris, 'I found nothing extraordinary;  as far as I'm concerned, ours are better;  the room is larger and more beautiful.'  She mentions correspondence involving Augustine Favrot's step-sister;  the writer's cousin Antoine;  Mr. Dubayle;  a 'curious man' whose name Duplantier cannot make out;  and Allegret.  The addresser sends her regards to Isabelle [Euphrosine Cécile Marie Isabelle Allard Duplantier, the addressee's daughter] and to her aunt and cousins, including the little female Tivolliers.  The addresser refers to the addressee as her cousin in opening and as her aunt in closing.  Written in blank space appears 'Mr. Laughunier.'	Peniston, Amélie Duplantier, 1821-1845.

Jean Claude Trénonay to 'cher frère,' 1783 Apr. 21	1783-04-21	In another's hand, Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes a 'dear brother' in Europe, addressing him with the formal 'vous.'  Trénonay acknowledges receiving the addressee's May 26, 1782, letter but not the one sent through Mr. Manaut, who may be imprisoned in Jamaica.  He states that his correspondence will pass through Mr. Falze and Ostend.  Trénonay indicates that he has more than one sister, one of whom is Madame Guimard, whose finances are discussed.  He asserts that he learned of the death of his brother (called 'Montferra' in the postscript) only through the addressee's letter and asks the recipient to represent him in the succession, alluding to the succession of an uncle in Voiron, France, as well.  When recounting problems that an unnamed person is causing the family, the writer quotes Cicero's famous line to Catilina: Quo usque tandem abutere patientia nostra.  Trénonay states that the recipient's nephew Armand Duplantier married the writer's stepdaughter three months after his March 21, 1781, arrival at Trénonay's, and he describes the couple's economic situation.  He discusses Miss Masse's succession held in Louisiana by a Mr. Broutin and expresses his desire to sell all his possessions and return to his relatives.  He mentions the recipient's wife and daughter and expresses joy on hearing of Mr. [De Bord?  De Bard?]'s advancement.  Trénonay asks the addressee to procure for him from an ambassador a letter of recommendation to the governor of Louisiana so as to facilitate exit from the colony.  He requests peas called 'pois Lombards,' which he says the recipient has at 'Chamfret,' along with notes on their cultivation.  Penciled on the back appears 'Allard de la Louisiane.'

Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey ( also spelled Chanfret) was born into a family of minor nobility in Moirans, France.  In 1755, he joined his uncle, Claude René Trénonay de Chanfrey (1697-1768), in the French colony of Louisiana.  The elder Trénonay de Chanfrey had originally come to Louisiana to cultivate lands in Iberville Parish given in 1717 to his first cousins, the four Pâris brothers (principally Joseph Pâris Duverney, 1684-1770).  The elder Trénonay died in Pointe Coupee Parish.  Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey (known simply as 'Claude Trénonay') made his home on a plantation near New Roads.  He was a successful planter and land-speculator, but accusations of cruelty to his slaves made him unpopular with both the Spanish government of Louisiana and his fellow planters.  In 1771, he married Marie Augustine Allain, widow Gérard.  Her death in 1777 left him with a stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gérard, whom he married off to his nephew, Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier.  Although Trénonay had promised to care for the couple financially, he became estranged from them.  Trénonay was murdered in his home on July 10, 1792, by one of his slaves, called 'La Tulipe.'		http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.

Jean Claude Trénonay to Gabrielle Trénonay Duplantier, 1777 Apr. 01	1777-04-01	Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes his sister, Gabrielle Duplantier, about sending her son Armand to Louisiana, where the writer hopes to marry his nephew to his stepdaughter, Augustine Gérard, and to provide for the couple.  Trénonay states that he has changed his mind about leaving Louisiana, conditions having greatly improved in the colony, above all in matters of trade.  He mentions having lost his wife two months previously and having had no children with her.  He mentions his brother in Paris at the beginning and extends his regards to the Guimard family toward the end.  He offers Miss Masse, Mr. Bureau, and the Count of Aranda as conveyers of correspondence.	Trénonay, Jean Claude, d. 1792.

Jean Claude Trénonay to Gabrielle Trénonay Duplantier, 1781 Mar. 30	1781-03-30	Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes his sister, Gabrielle Duplantier, to announce the arrival of her son Armand Duplantier in Louisiana.  He speaks of economic conditions in the colony and of plans to attack Pensacola, Florida.  He mentions the Guimard family and Mr. Perrin and states that he fears Miss Masse is dead.  He suggests sending mail through Paul Bureau in La Rochelle, the Poupets in Cap Français, or the Count of Aranda via the 'Reverend Father' Lag[oyais?] and the Abbé Martinet.  He says that he is bringing the letter to a close so as to converse with Monferra.  He asserts that he is not going to write the 'reverend father,' who has refused to answer him (despite the opportunities that Miss Masse had afforded him to do so) and who (the author has learned) has a charming daughter with many advantages in store.  In a postscript, he recounts Augustin Mottin de La Balme’s death at the hands of Amerindians en route to the siege of Detroit.  He refers to his stepdaughter as his daughter and says that 'Edevige' is the subject of her conversations with Armand.	Trénonay, Jean Claude, d. 1792.

Jean Claude Trénonay to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1785 Apr. 10	1785-04-10	Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes his brother-in-law Joseph Allard Duplantier, whom he calls 'dear brother' and addresses with the formal 'vous.'  Trénonay announces that the recipient's son Armand has two handsome sons and that 'Armant' will be sending a portrait of his wife as well as one of the older boy.  Although at the time Trénonay is unable to sell his possessions and leave a country that displeases him greatly, he asserts that he wants to return to Europe as soon as possible.  He discusses the economic circumstances in which he finds himself and relates how slaves fit into it.  The addresser says Armand left Trénonay's house a year ago to reside a league away on his own plantation.  He recounts that whereas he did not want Armand's family to leave, rarely three days pass without their seeing each other, and they are more advanced with their indigo than Trénonay was upon his return from Europe.  Trénonay describes and seeks help for an eye problem, complaining against the absence of a doctor or good surgeon in the colony.  He states that he learned of the death of his brother 'Montferra' from Lagoyette (who seems to be the 'dear brother' addressed in the April 21, 1783, letter) and that the latter has not responded to Trénonay's letters, some of them concerning Montferra's succession.  The writer relates that Mr. Bureau in La Rochelle and Miss Masse in Paris, through whom Trénonay formerly sent correspondence, are both dead.  The author discusses the means, places, and persons through which to send correspondence, one of them being Mr. Poupet in La Rochelle.  Trénonay states that he has requested seeds from  Lagoyette and that he is fatigued by the latter's silence.  He mentions the recipient's wife, Madame Guimard, and Mr. Prévieux.  Trénonay relates conditions that could be leading to war between the United States and Spain as well as their effects on the economy and speaks disparagingly of Anglo-Americans, whom he considers worse than Amerindian 'savages.'

Jean Claude Trénonay to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1787 Jan. 03	1787-01-03	Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes Joseph Allard Duplantier, discussing the ways to send correspondence to Louisiana, the seeds he has received from France, his finances and business affairs (including slaves), indigo, and an eventual exit from the colony.  He mentions his late brother Montferra and the fact that the recipient's son has two children.  He relates his eye problems and states that he is still bleeding sick slaves.  Trénonay discusses 'Chanfret,' which he learned his brother in Paris would consider transferring to him, and he explains how the vicinity of Moirans, France, would not suit him after having spent the greater part of his life in a 'country of liberty.'  He insists that, contrary to popular belief, the Spanish government (at least in Louisiana) is not hard and that the colony enjoys more freedoms than 'English America' does.  He claims that the people in Louisiana are more decent than those in French colonies and that while religion is rigorously enforced in Spain, there are few constraints in the colony.  Trénonay speaks more favorably than before about Louisiana, relates how it is changing, and becomes so optimistic about the colony's future that he says he would never leave if his family were there.

Jean Claude Trénonay to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1788 Dec. 02	1788-12-02	Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes Joseph Allard Duplantier, 'avocat en parlement,' Voiron, France, complaining that the writer's sister must be as lazy about corresponding as is their brother Lagoyette, whom the author believes to be preoccupied with gardening.  Trénonay relates his poor health, due in part to renal colic, and how he has handed over the management of his affairs (rendered worrisome by the conduct of slaves) to a 'worthy Englishman.'  He mentions the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 and how victims are still waiting for aid from the Spanish king.  Trénonay reports that Duplantier’s son Armand has left the plantation on which he was residing to establish himself on a newly acquired one situated nine leagues from the writer's home.  As in the January 3, 1787, letter, Trénonay affirms that Armand and children are in good health, but Armand's wife is not.  The writer announces that he will send the recipient and Lagoyette some plants care of 'Messieurs Bassae Alegre et Compagnie' in Le Havre.	Trénonay, Jean Claude, d. 1792.

Jean Claude Trénonay to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1790 Mar. 11	1790-03-11	Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, adresses Joseph Allard Duplantier, « Député aux états généraux, » Paris, France.  Duplantier receives the correspondence at another Mr. Trénonay's address in Paris.  The addresser congratulates the addressee on being named deputy for their province.   As in the December 2, 1788, letter, the writer recounts how he and Duplantier’s son Armand differ concerning purchasing and running of plantations.  Trénonay states that he wanted to rear one of Armand's sons, but the boy's parents did not want the child to live elsewhere.  The addresser relates that he has three men with him, one of whom is a consoling seventeen-year-old and another is an Englishman who has been there eleven years.  Trénonay recounts his failing health as well as using pareira brava root for renal colic.  He relates the adverse effect on the colony's economy that paper bills have had, especially since the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788, the monetary situation and his health being the two main factors keeping him from returning to France.

Jean Claude Trénonay to Joseph Allard Duplantier, 1792 Feb. 04	1792-02-04	Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes Joseph Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, whom the addresser mentions as having been at Versailles.  Trénonay claims that he has kept up with the French Revolution and the new constitution (which he praises and which is also mentioned in his March 11, 1790, letter) through papers sent by European friends.  He declares that he has heard of an approaching war between France and Spain that England might join on Spain's side before the National Assembly adjourns.  He mentions Guillaume-Thomas-François Raynal in passing.  Trénonay pleads Louisiana's case in hopes that France will take its former colony back, recounting the progress there over the years and the region's potential for the future, which would include slave trading as well as agriculture and various industries.  He relates some of his slave purchasing and the fact that Armand Duplantier has a third son. Trénonay states his belief that the boys should leave home for education and recounts how dismissed, mostly drunken, and vice-filled soldiers are used to instruct the colonists' children but end up only corrupting the latter.  Trénonay reiterates that his health and the currency situation keep him from returning to France, and he blames the governors and intendants for ruining Louisiana.  The writer discusses the 'reverend father' and mentions that the so-called person has a wife.  Trénonay links the 'reverend father' to Montferra's succession and criticizes him for not writing.  Trénonay refers to the recipient's pastor, Monsieur Perrin, while joking in the postscript about the addresser's 'patriotic sermon.'	Trénonay, Jean Claude, d. 1792.

Armand Allard Duplantier to  Guy Allard Duplantier, 1807 August 02	1807-08-02	Armand Allard Duplantier, New Orleans, informs his brother, Guy Allard Duplantier, at Le Plantier, Voiron, France, that he has bought a plantation forming part of a New Orleans faubourg and is dividing it.  He says that he wants to hear from Dupuy about little Guy, whom he also calls 'little Guillaume.'  The writer also requests seeds and discusses vegetable gardening.  On the back appears an inscription and stamp indicating that the letter was forwarded by A. M. Labouchere and Trotreau in Nantes, France.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827.	Duplantier, Armand, 1753-1827--Family.;Suburbs--Louisiana--New Orleans.;French Americans--Family relationships--Louisiana.	Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Amélie Duplantier to Antoine Allard Duplantier and Henriette Paris d’Avancourt de Treffonds Duplantier, 1841 Apr. 12;  J.C. to Madame Allard Duplantier, undated	1841-04-12	Amélie Duplantier, Paris, addresses her cousin Antoine Allard Duplantier as 'uncle' in a brief note.  She says that she received a large package of letters from New Orleans and is forwarding one destined for his address.  She breaks off to write a note to her cousin's wife, Henriette, whom she calls both 'cousin' and 'aunt.'  She refers fondly to Henriette's little girl, Isabelle.  Although Duplantier implies that she is forwarding a New Orleans letter, the longer letter included with her notes to Antoine Allard Duplantier and his wife, Henriette, is from someone who had visited 'Eugène' [Augustin Séraphin Eugène Tivollier] at his French boarding school [possibly in Lyon] the day of the letter's composition and who lives or is staying in the same locale as Eugène.  The longer letter (undated but composed at 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday) is from 'J.C.' to 'Madame Allard Duplantier at Voiron.'  The addresser (a man) refers to the addressee as 'my very dear cousin.'  On the back appears, 'Mme. Nina is going to La Martelière next week.'  The addresser states that he is happy to receive news from the addressee concerning the Amélie who is Eugène's mother [Jeanne Amélie Joséphine Allard Duplantier, wife of André Louis Séraphin Tivollier and daughter of Magdeleine Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier and Guy Antoine Joseph Allard Duplantier].  He refers to Amélie’s being treated by bloodletting for an illness while pregnant.  The writer devotes the bulk of the letter to the sick and pregnant Amélie’s son Eugène.  The addresser defends Eugène's inquietude, as the boy, away at school, has been left in the dark concerning the gravity of his mother's illness and other occurrences at Voiron.  The writer criticizes both the fact that Eugène has not been informed of his brother Jules's first communion and the young age at which Jules received the sacrament.  He relates Eugène's reactions to being shown family correspondence and reports taking the child to the writer's place as well as to a shoemaker's during the 30-minute afternoon snack break the day before the letter's composition.  The addresser describes Eugène's preparations for first communion.  He states that on the same day that he wrote the letter, he procured the child a copy of The Imitation of Christ at the latter's request;  at the same time, the addresser took a bundle of letters to forward from Eugène to the child's mother.  The writer states that he is sending a package to Nicolas as well.  Aware that 'Mr. Séraphin' plans to visit Eugène toward the end of the month, the author provides the school's schedule for leaves.  The addresser gives a list of items and their costs for reimbursement.  They include purchases for 'Mme. Allard' and 'Mme. Henriette' and payment to 'Mme. Marcel.'  In closing, the writer sends his best to Antoine and Séraphin.	Peniston, Amélie Duplantier, 1821-1845.	French Americans--Family relationships--Louisiana.; Extended families--France.; Pregnant women--Health and hygiene--France.; Schoolboys--Religious life--France.; First communion--Catholic Church.	The eldest daughter of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier’s third son, Guy Allard Duplantier, and his wife Antoinette Azema Avart (d. 1881), Amélie Augustine Allard Duplantier was reared as a ward of her aunt the widowed Mrs. Louis Robert Avart (née Claude Augustine EugénieDelachaise).  Amélie and her aunt travelled to France, taking the grand tour from 1839 to 1841. While there, they visited the Allard ancestral home of Le Plantier in Voiron, as well as Paris, Lyon, Cauterets, and Bagnères-de-Bigorre.  Amélie married a young doctor, Thomas Peniston (1815-1863), in 1842 and bore him one son, Thomas Joseph Allard Peniston (1844-1881).  Amélie died in 1845.  In creating New Orleans' Faubourg St. Joseph in 1849, Mrs. Avart  named Amelia Street in her niece's memory and Peniston Street for Amélie’s husband.		http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/5060.pdf	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, Mss. 5060, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.
