The camp name is misspelled "Grouce" verso. It should read Camp Groce, which was a Confederate training facility and prisoner of war camp near the present day town of Hempstead, TX. Prisoners first arrived after the Battle of Galveston, 01 January 1863. By December 1863 all prisoners were evacuated to Camp Ford near Tyler, TX., and Camp Groce closed. Due to overcrowding in Camp Ford after the Union's Red River Campaign failed, Camp Groce was reopened in July 1864 and remained open until the end of the War. Gen. George Armstrong Custer and his command camped here 01 September - 01 December 1865.

Prince  (Studio : New Orleans, La.);Prince, Louis Isaac, 1832-1867, photographer	The camera stands on the river bank looking toward the USS Essex, a 1000-ton ironclad river gunboat. She was converted in stages from the steam ferry New Era. Originally constructed at New Albany, Indiana, in 1856, the ship was purchased in September 1861 by the U.S. Army for its Western Gunboat Flotilla. Modified into a 355-ton "timberclad" gunboat. Renamed Essex soon thereafter, she received iron armor and other changes and was then actively employed in operations during early 1862. On 6 February 1862, she was badly damaged by enemy gunfire during an attack on Fort Henry, Tennessee. During subsequent repairs, Essex' Commanding Officer, William D. Porter, spared little expense in upgrading his ship into one of the most powerful ironclads on the Western Rivers. Lengthened, widened, reengined, rearmored and completely altered in appearance, Essex was back in service in time for operations against Vicksburg, Mississippi, in July. On the 22nd of that month she ran past the enemy fortress city, engaging and damaging the Confederate ironclad Arkansas along the way. After joining Rear Admiral Farragut's squadron as the only Federal ironclad on the lower Mississippi, she helped repel an attack on Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on 5 August and was instrumental in the destruction of the Arkansas the next day. Essex was formally transferred to the Navy in October 1862 and remained active on the rivers through the rest of the Civil War.

The camera stands on the bank of a river looking toward the USS Chickasaw, a 1300-ton Milwaukee class twin-turret ironclad river monitor built at Carondelet, Missouri. She was commissioned in May 1864. After brief service on the Mississippi River, in early July she was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. She participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay on 5 August 1865, and was largely responsible for the defeat and capture of the Confederate ironclad Tennessee during the later stages of that action.

The camera stand on the bank of a river looking toward the U.S.S.Estrella, a side-wheel steamer. She was transferred from the Army to the Navy late in 1862, and commissioned soon after. Assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, Estrella served throughout the war off Mobile and New Orleans, along the Texas coast, and up the rivers flowing into the Gulf. During the first 13 days of November 1862 she took part in a series of engagements with CSS Cotton and Confederate shore batteries along the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Teche. With her captain serving as commander of the flotilla maintained in Berwick Bay Estrella led the attack on CSS Queen of the West 14 April 1863. Four days later, Cooke led his flotilla up the Atchafalaya once more, to attack the batteries at Butte-a-la-Rose. The batteries were captured intact, with their garrison of 60 men and large supplies of ammunition and commissary stores. From 3 to 6 May 1863, Estrella sailed up the Red River to join in the attack on Fort De Russy, and during June and July participated in the attacks on Port Hudson which led to its fall on 9 July. After being repaired at New Orleans in the first 4 months of 1865, Estrella served as flagship of the West Gulf Squadron, continuing to cruise in the Gulf of Mexico and its tributary waters until 30 June 1867, when she sailed for New York Navy Yard. There she was decommissioned 16 July 1867, and sold 9 October 1867.

The camera stands on the bank of a river looking out toward the USS (once CSS) Tennessee, a 1273-ton ironclad ram, was built at Selma, Alabama. Launched in February 1863, her outfitting was completed at Mobile, where she was commissioned in February 1864. As flagship of Admiral Franklin Buchanan, she was by far the strongest unit of the naval part of the defenses of Mobile Bay. To counter her, the Federal Navy had to bring ironclad monitors to the Gulf of Mexico. On 5 August 1864, Tennessee battled against Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut's fleet as it steamed past Forts Morgan and Gaines into Mobile Bay. Though she was able to inflict some damage on the Federal ships, Farragut successfully entered the Bay and anchored beyond the reach of the Confederate forts' guns. Admiral Buchanan then took his ship up toward the Union warships, engaging them in an intense battle that ended with Tennessee surrounded by her enemies and battered into surrender. The former Confederate ironclad was promptly taken into the Union Navy as USS Tennessee. With her combat damage quickly repaired, she was employed during operations to capture Fort Morgan later in August. In the autumn of 1864, Tennessee was sent to New Orleans, Louisiana, for further repairs. She subsequently served with the U.S. Navy's Mississippi Squadron until after the end of the Civil War.

Built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1854, she was chartered by the Navy in April 1861 and sent to enforce the Federal blockade of the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. In August 1861, shortly before Quaker City's charter was to expire, she was purchased for formal conversion into a warship. This work began in September and she was commissioned in December 1861. While serving in the Gulf of Mexico area in May 1865, she assisted in the chase of CSS Webb as that ship ran down the Mississippi River in an abortive attempt to escape from the collapsing Confederacy. Decommissioned in May 1865, Quaker City was sold a month later and resumed her commercial career.

	177 - U.S.S. Quaker City at Pensacola	unknown	ca. 1864	Yes		United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Photographs;Quaker City (Steamer)--Photographs	The camera stands ashore looking over near shore pilings toward the Quaker City, a 1428-ton (burden) wooden side-wheel steamship. Built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1854, she was chartered by the Navy in April 1861 and sent to enforce the Federal blockade of the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. In August 1861, shortly before Quaker City's charter was to expire, she was purchased for formal conversion into a warship. This work began in September and she was commissioned in December 1861. While serving in the Gulf of Mexico area in May 1865, she assisted in the chase of CSS Webb as that ship ran down the Mississippi River in an abortive attempt to escape from the collapsing Confederacy. Decommissioned in May 1865, Quaker City was sold a month later and resumed her commercial career.

She participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay on 5 August 1865, and was largely responsible for the defeat and capture of the Confederate ironclad Tennessee during the later stages of that action. Following the Battle of Mobile Bay, Chickasaw bombarded the Confederate-held forts in the lower bay. She remained on the bay for the remainder of the Civil War and participated in operations to take the city of Mobile, Alabama, during March and April 1865. In July of that year, she was sent to New Orleans and decommissioned. The verso inscribed, "Chickasaw."

Assigned to duty on the Mississippi River and its tributaries, Lexington took part in several actions with Confederate vessels and land forces during the last four months of 1861 and early 1862. She operated on the Mississippi River during much of the rest of 1862 and was formally transferred to the Navy in October. In March-May 1864, she took part in expeditions up the Black, Ouachita, and Red rivers in Louisiana, and helped defeat an attack on White River Station, Arkansas, in June.

The camera stand on the bank of a river looking toward the U.S.S.Estrella, a side-wheel steamer. She was transferred from the Army to the Navy late in 1862, and commissioned soon after. Assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, Estrella served throughout the war off Mobile and New Orleans, along the Texas coast, and up the rivers flowing into the Gulf. During the first 13 days of November 1862 she took part in a series of engagements with CSS Cotton and Confederate shore batteries along the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Teche. With her captain serving as commander of the flotilla maintained in Berwick Bay Estrella led the attack on CSS Queen of the West 14 April 1863. Four days later, Cooke led his flotilla up the Atchafalaya once more, to attack the batteries at Butte-a-la-Rose. The batteries were captured intact, with their garrison of 60 men and large supplies of ammunition and commissary stores. From 3 to 6 May 1863, Estrella sailed up the Red River to join in the attack on Fort De Russy, and during June and July participated in the attacks on Port Hudson which led to its fall on 9 July. After being repaired at New Orleans in the first 4 months of 1865, Estrella served as flagship of the West Gulf Squadron, continuing to cruise in the Gulf of Mexico and its tributary waters until 30 June 1867, when she sailed for New York Navy Yard. There she was decommissioned 16 July 1867, and sold 9 October 1867.

McPherson & Oliver, photographers	ca. 1864	Yes		United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Photographs;Tennessee (Ironclad)--Photographs;McPherson, William D., photographer;McPherson & Oliver (Studio : New Orleans, La.)	The camera stands on the bank of a river looking out toward the USS (once CSS) Tennessee, a 1273-ton ironclad ram, was built at Selma, Alabama. Launched in February 1863, her outfitting was completed at Mobile, where she was commissioned in February 1864. As flagship of Admiral Franklin Buchanan, she was by far the strongest unit of the naval part of the defenses of Mobile Bay. To counter her, the Federal Navy had to bring ironclad monitors to the Gulf of Mexico. On 5 August 1864, Tennessee battled against Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut's fleet as it steamed past Forts Morgan and Gaines into Mobile Bay. Though she was able to inflict some damage on the Federal ships, Farragut successfully entered the Bay and anchored beyond the reach of the Confederate forts' guns. Admiral Buchanan then took his ship up toward the Union warships, engaging them in an intense battle that ended with Tennessee surrounded by her enemies and battered into surrender. The former Confederate ironclad was promptly taken into the Union Navy as USS Tennessee. With her combat damage quickly repaired, she was employed during operations to capture Fort Morgan later in August. In the autumn of 1864, Tennessee was sent to New Orleans, Louisiana, for further repairs. She subsequently served with the U.S. Navy's Mississippi Squadron until after the end of the Civil War.  There is a 2-cent blue tax stamp cancelled 16 September 1864 on verso.

Quaker City at Pensacola	unknown	ca. 1864	Yes		United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Photographs;Quaker City (Steamer)--Photographs	The camera stands ashore looking over near shore pilings toward the Quaker City, a 1428-ton (burden) wooden side-wheel steamship. Built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1854, she was chartered by the Navy in April 1861 and sent to enforce the Federal blockade of the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. In August 1861, shortly before Quaker City's charter was to expire, she was purchased for formal conversion into a warship. This work began in September and she was commissioned in December 1861. While serving in the Gulf of Mexico area in May 1865, she assisted in the chase of CSS Webb as that ship ran down the Mississippi River in an abortive attempt to escape from the collapsing Confederacy. Decommissioned in May 1865, Quaker City was sold a month later and resumed her commercial career.

Work began on a fort at Mobile Bay’s entrance in 1819. The fort was built at Mobile Point, located at the western extreme of the peninsula that stretches across much of Mobile Bay’s mouth. Completed in 1834, the fort was named Fort Morgan in honor of General Daniel Morgan, a Revolutionary War hero.<br><br>The Mobile Point lighthouse was completed by June of 1822 at an expense of 9,995. The lamps in the lantern room atop the forty-foot brick tower were lit for the first time on September 29, 1822. The lighthouse stood on a bluff near the southwest corner of the star-shaped Fort Morgan.<br><br>Following the outbreak of the War Between the States, Confederate forces took control of the fort, and the Mobile Point Light was deactivated. At dawn on August 5, 1864, a fleet of eighteen Union ships commanded by Admiral David Farragut approached the entrance to Mobile Bay. A fierce exchange of cannon fire ensued at 7:30 AM, during which the Tecumseh, a Union vessel, struck a mine and sank. The incident threw the Union fleet into disarray. The remaining vessels sailed into the bay and succeeded in capturing the fort on August 23. During the battle for the fort, the lighthouse was struck multiple times, severely damaging one side of the tower.

Rogers, John (b Salem, MA, 30 Oct 1829; d New Canaan, CT, 26 July 1904). American sculptor. Beginning in 1863, Rogers decided to concentrate on the plaster figures and groups (known as the 'Rogers Groups') that were to remain popular for the next 30 years. His first major group, Checker Players (1859), was based on his own 1850 clay model (itself based on a design by David Wilkie) and was followed by several Civil War subjects, including Union Refugees (1863) and How the Fort Was Taken (1863), which appealed to the patriotism of many Americans. Such works as the Fugitive's Story (1869) reflect Rogers's abolitionist sympathies and illustrate his talent for combining recognizable portraits (of leading abolitionists) and accurate details of contemporary dress and furniture with a more generalized evocation of human compassion in simply composed groupings.<br>The small figures were mass-produced in molded plaster, built on metal armatures and painted in a single earth tone to reduce costs. Rogers developed a mail-order business, based in New York, and his groups were widely advertised. Catalogues of his works were issued from 1866 to 1895, latterly by the Rogers Statuary Company. Rogers produced about 100 different groups, with 87 titles and 13 variations, selling in all about 80,000 pieces. His work was also a popular subject for stereoscopic publishers, and at least 40 different groups were made available in that medium. Rogers's inexpensive groups, almost all selling for between $10 and $15, were seen by critics and by sculptors wedded to the dominant ideal tradition as pandering to the uneducated public, but he defended his scenes of everyday life and his groups based on the better-known writings of Washington Irving, Shakespeare, and even Goethe, as a way of developing a broad-based appreciation of sculpture among those who had never purchased it before. By the time of his retirement in 1894, changing tastes had relegated his work to obscurity. Only in 1937 did a representative selection of the 'Rogers Groups' enter a major public collection (New York, NY Hist. Soc.). Rogers was the only active representative in sculpture of the Realist and genre traditions predominant in mid-19th-century American painting, and his strongly anecdotal works remain a unique chapter in American sculptural history.

Work began on a fort at Mobile Bay’s entrance in 1819. The fort was built at Mobile Point, located at the western extreme of the peninsula that stretches across much of Mobile Bay’s mouth. Completed in 1834, the fort was named Fort Morgan in honor of General Daniel Morgan, a Revolutionary War hero.<br><br>The Mobile Point lighthouse was completed by June of 1822 at an expense of 9,995. The lamps in the lantern room atop the forty-foot brick tower were lit for the first time on September 29, 1822. The lighthouse stood on a bluff near the southwest corner of the star-shaped Fort Morgan.<br><br>Following the outbreak of the War Between the States, Confederate forces took control of the fort, and the Mobile Point Light was deactivated. At dawn on August 5, 1864, a fleet of eighteen Union ships commanded by Admiral David Farragut approached the entrance to Mobile Bay. A fierce exchange of cannon fire ensued at 7:30 AM, during which the Tecumseh, a Union vessel, struck a mine and sank. The incident threw the Union fleet into disarray. The remaining vessels sailed into the bay and succeeded in capturing the fort on August 23. During the battle for the fort, the lighthouse was struck multiple times, severely damaging one side of the tower. The camera stands at eye level looking toward and past the ruins of the lighthouse on the dunes.

	189 - Camp Life: The Card Players	M. Stadtfeld	ca. 1864	Yes		United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Photographs;Plaster sculpture--Photographs;M. Stadtfeld (Studio : New York City, N.Y.)	Rogers, John (b Salem, MA, 30 Oct 1829; d New Canaan, CT, 26 July 1904). American sculptor. Beginning in 1863, Rogers decided to concentrate on the plaster figures and groups (known as the 'Rogers Groups') that were to remain popular for the next 30 years. His first major group, Checker Players (1859), was based on his own 1850 clay model (itself based on a design by David Wilkie) and was followed by several Civil War subjects, including Union Refugees (1863) and How the Fort Was Taken (1863), which appealed to the patriotism of many Americans. Such works as the Fugitive's Story (1869) reflect Rogers's abolitionist sympathies and illustrate his talent for combining recognizable portraits (of leading abolitionists) and accurate details of contemporary dress and furniture with a more generalized evocation of human compassion in simply composed groupings.<br>The small figures were mass-produced in molded plaster, built on metal armatures and painted in a single earth tone to reduce costs. Rogers developed a mail-order business, based in New York, and his groups were widely advertised. Catalogues of his works were issued from 1866 to 1895, latterly by the Rogers Statuary Company. Rogers produced about 100 different groups, with 87 titles and 13 variations, selling in all about 80,000 pieces. His work was also a popular subject for stereoscopic publishers, and at least 40 different groups were made available in that medium. Rogers's inexpensive groups, almost all selling for between $10 and $15, were seen by critics and by sculptors wedded to the dominant ideal tradition as pandering to the uneducated public, but he defended his scenes of everyday life and his groups based on the better-known writings of Washington Irving, Shakespeare, and even Goethe, as a way of developing a broad-based appreciation of sculpture among those who had never purchased it before. By the time of his retirement in 1894, changing tastes had relegated his work to obscurity. Only in 1937 did a representative selection of the 'Rogers Groups' enter a major public collection (New York, NY Hist. Soc.). Rogers was the only active representative in sculpture of the Realist and genre traditions predominant in mid-19th-century American painting, and his strongly anecdotal works remain a unique chapter in American sculptural history.
