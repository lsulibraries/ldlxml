For thousands of years, a doll festival has been held on the third day of March. The festival lasts for three days. To the people of Japan, the doll festivals are expressionsof the ideal of Japanese womanhood--to be a good and true wife, a wise and loving mother. It was a happy inspiration on the part of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America to organize a movement to send American dolls as representatives to the doll festival of Japan in 1927. Eleven hundred dolls sailed from San Francisco to Japan. Forty-eight dolls were sent to the Imperial Museum representing the forty-eight states. Because of the arrival of the friendship dolls the Japanese Children's Friendship Association was organized. After receiving the many dolls sent to them by the united States, the Japanese Children's Friendship Association sent one thousand dolls to the children of the United States. This doll was one of these dolls.

Hawaiian Holoku man	48a: Male adult, Hawaiian Holuku man, cloth head and body, painted features, yarn hair, yellow felt cape on upper body, yellow felt head dress, brown printed loin cloth, he is holding a long stick, machine-made. Accompanying information describes that the Hawaiian holuku has an interesting history. It was a creation of the missionaries who came to Hawaii about 1820. The good New Englanders were shocked at the happy state of undress in which they found the Hawaiians and they set about it at once to clothe their converts. The trouble was to find a style which would adequately cover those ample brown bodies and yet be simple to sew. After some thought they hit upon the very thing, the Mother Hubbard, a style common to New England of that day. Additions have been made to the basic style since then--a train, a fancy petticoat, ruffles, and so on. But the sweeping princess lines of the original dress remain the same. At pUblic functions and even on the streets you will see these elderly dignified Hawaiian ladies in bright flowered holokus, the train draped over an arm and wearing either flowers in their hair or large hand-woven hauhala hats decorated with a lei of flowers or bright feathers. The holoku is worn by women of every race in the Islands but, none with quite the charm and dignity of the Hawaiians. The word holoku means literally stop-go referring to the movement of the sewing machine. The Muumuu (literally cut off-sleeves cot off) was used originally as an under-garment, a night-gown or even a bathing dress. The modern version has now become as popular a day time dress as its more aristocratic sister the holoku.	23 cm			Dolls	Asia	Hawaii	Honolulu	Hawaiian Holoku woman	Box 10																										2012-06-19	2012-06-19	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16313coll9/id/246	246	247.cpd	/p16313coll9/image/247.cpd

During that period all states were at war with one another. Moo-Lan's father, an officer of the Han State, was supposed to lead an army to defend the country, however, he was old and had no sons except the daughter Moo-Lan, therefore, Moo-Lan, who loved her father dearly, disguised herself as a man, to take her father's place as an officer, and to lead the country to fight the enemies. She fought side by side for many years with her fellow soldiers and officers but none had discovered that she was a girl except to respect her as a brave soldier and an able general. Finally her army defeated the enemies. She became the nation's great hero and then her father announced that she was a young lady, not a man, therefore, the Ruler of Han State paid special respect to her and proclaimed her as a most filial piety daughter of the nation (This description was written by a Chinese woman).	29 cm			Dolls	Asia	China			Box 10																										2012-06-19	2012-06-19	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16313coll9/id/259	259	260.cpd	/p16313coll9/image/260.cpd

Flora McFlimsey Madame Alexander doll	Female girl, all-composition doll, open mouth with four upper teeth, sleeping eyes, lashes, mohair wig with braid, swivel neck, jointed at shoulders and hips, white organdy underwear, under-skirt trimmed with lace. Green, yellow, red plaids knee length high waist dress, white lace trimmed pinafore, flat sole shoes, manufactured doll body, costume, machine-made. Accompanying information describes as Flora Madame Alexander doll. This Madame Alexander doll was very popular in the 1920s. The costume is that of the 1890s. The dolls of Beatrice Alexander Berhman and the Alexander doll company are so popular with modern doll collectors that entire books could be written about them (and have been). The reasons for this popularity are not hard to find. Not only have Madame Alexander dolls been comparatively well made, but many of them display an incisive feeling for subject matter that is popular at a given moment. Madame Alexander has had a knack at least since the 1930s for making portrait dolls of the very people and literary characters who seem to personify an age.

Frozen Charlotte	Female child, frozen charlotte, glazed China pillar doll molded and painted features and hair, molded and painted boots, lace underwear, white lace trimmed dress, ribbon sash tied at back, manufactured doll body, dress, hand-made, Frozen charlottes are one-piece molded porcelain dolls that are completely unjointed. Known as pillar dolls, solid China dolls, or bathing babies, they were produced either glazed or unglazed and in a variety of grades and sizes. Most Frozen charlottes are chubby nudes of indeterminate sex with clenched fists and bent elbows. The wide variety of hair styles would suggest that the dolls were indeed intended to be female, although it should be remembered that through most of the 19th century male and female children were dressed and combed identically. Modern doll collectors who insist that they know a male frozen charlotte when they see one and call such dolls 'frozen charlies'. Pillar dolls range in size from one to over eighteen inches high and occasionally wear molded bonnets or hair ribbons, despite their nudity. Of the several explanations of the term 'frozen charlotte,' the most plausible derives from a civil War ballad about 'fair charlotte,' who, eager to be wooed by her suitor one winter's night, went out into the Vermont cold wearing only a silken cloak and promptly froze to death.
