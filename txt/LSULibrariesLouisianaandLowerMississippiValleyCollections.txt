It has been defined, " Highly figurative language, written in verse or measured lines: "but this definition  is far from perfect. It describes, it is true, the exterior form,  but the soul, the aerial part is overlooked. There is a hid-  ,l,n something in poetry, which cannot be defined or described. It can only be felt. He who has never read a fine  poem, can form no more accurate conception of it, than a blind  man can of the beauties of the rainbow.  Still, though we be unable to define all that is conveyed by  the term, there arc some features so strongly marked, that  something like a delineation can be effected, we will attempt a portraiture of these.  Verse is a succession of long and short, or what is very  similar, accented and unaccented syllables. The pronunciation of these produces rhythm of the same kind, though not  equal in variety, to that of music. Lines of poetry maybe  divided by bars, and set to music with perfect propriety, A  succession of long syllables gives the expression of majesty  short, give life and vivacity; and a judicious mixture gives  variety. It possesses likewise the like pauses. Now as the  love of music is natural, we may ascertain the reason why  the most ignorant are fond of poetry; and "the dwellers on  the rocks" and in the caverns of the earth, have their songs  and ballads, and relate their deeds of arms and tales of love in  verse. Poetry is invariably anterior in date to prose; for the  same reason, that it makes a vivid impression on the mind  when the apprehension is so obtuse, that prose is unintelligi  hie. Hence it is, that the earliest monuments of history of  laws and religion, are found in verse. Even before the art  of writing was invented, traditions were preserved in rude,  barbaric measures.  The imagery is chosen from nature.    The poet, to please,  '•alls up every beauty that meets the eye, and every agreeable t  sound that salutes the ear:   the mountain steep,  the dizzy ■  precipice, the rugged crag, and the carpet-clad plain.    The o  gnarled oak, and the fragile lily; the odoriferous shrub, and p    ° _   , .......    1   .l.„c.„..r,|   f.  ■adding rose; the giant roar of. h e cataract, and thesweet features, that of Egypt.  the .. ,,...  voice of the " silver-footed " stream, that trips melodious over  Ws of polished  pearls; the dark cavern, whose Avernian  Poetry speaks the language of nature, and speaks it to the  heart.  Its subject is the human heart. It describes emotions and  manners living as they rise. When it addresses the virtuous  susceptibilities, or cultivates the vicious propens.'ties of our  nature, it speaks a language which cannot be mistaken, and  must be obeyed. These are some of the reasons why poetry  has ever exerted so great an influence. Nature makes the  heart warm; but science makes the head clear. *  »        * A very large proportion of the ignorant, and  even many who do not deserve this opprobrious epithet, are  impelled to action by feeling and passion, rather than philosophy. They act with enthusiasm, feel intensely, but reason  tamely. It is a truth which must be admitted on all sides,  that a very large proportion of even civilized people are littlo  in advance of their ancestors. The same poems remain popular, that were admired in remote antiquity, and the same  or similar feelings pervade certain classes. With this class  in England, " Chevy Chace" is more universally read, than  our highly finished poems, and has more weight, because  it is better understood, and better accoids with the fierce  spirit of the lower classes. Robin Hood is the poacher's  text book, and has caused more offences against the game  laws than unjust rigor could prevent. Men understand and  obey the language of poetry, long before they comprehend  the laborious deductions of philosophy.  It will not be. deemed irrelevant to our present purpose, to  glance at some of the chief poetic works, stating the known  -md probable effects upon the character of their readers.

These circumstances alone would tend to  produce vivacity and genius among the people. But theirchar-  ucter was at least modified by these two great poets.   As re-  p-ards mythology, there is little doubt, that, prior to the I he-  o-ony and Iliad, nothing like a system existed.    Paganism  availed, and probably resembled closely, in its prominent  Sgypt.

From these materials he composed his Theogony,  which very soon after became a text look in pagan theology.  Fables, which, related in prose, would have been ridiculous,  by the charms of his verso weie rendered fascinating and  delightful. The moral, if moral he intended, was overlooked by the enchanted reader; he received fable as truth, and  adopted it as an article of his faith. Homer followed, and  using the same deities as the machinery of his inimitable  poems, attached new and increased importance, by the grandeur of his "surpassing genius." Olympus and Ida became  the residence and court of Jove; Cyprus, the favored seat of  Venus; Vulcan established his officinvm in /Etna; and At  las groaned under the weight of the skies. Many fables o(  Homer, which were doubtless understood by his hearers,  when the wandering minstrel recited his detached pieces,  which, afterwards, having lost their point, or moral, were  taken as sober truth. Homer was the perennial fountain,  whence flowed a thousand streams through all the poetry of  the ancient world. lie was the sun from which all lesser  orbs derived their borrowed light, All the influence which  was created by the poetry of Greece and Rome, is traceable  to this grand source. How far Homer ruled the ascendant  in Grecian literature', is well understood. His Iliad and Odyssey were the foundation on which was reared that bi aiiliful  superstructure which continues to instruct, eh light, andcharm  the world, It is the eflect on character of which I speak.  When Pisistrntus obtained the supreme power of Athens, the  character of that afterwards refined and gallant city was not  formed. He had become acquainted with the works of the  Ionian bard, and must receive credit for collecting and arranging them in proper order. The Iliad and Odyssey became  known to the Athenians, and were read with avidity. The  spirit of the people changed, and the fate of Hippins mid  Hipparchus, may, in part, have been the result of the  introduction of the works of Homer into Athens. " Homer,  (says Agis,) is the poet of the Spartans, because he teaches  men how to light; llesiod is the poet of the Helots,because  he teaches them lo work." No one, even at this time, can  read the Iliad, without being wrought up lo the highestpitch  of enthusiasm, by its fire, sublimity and beauty. The reader  must he-come a Greek or a Trojan: he must fight on the side  of Hector or Achilles, and weep over the premature fate of  Palroclus or Sarpedon. Now if a poem, written three thousand years ago, narrating the history of a siege/, and sacking  of a city, in which we can take no other interest than common sympathy, can have such an eflect, what must have been  that influence on the people who spoke its language, whose  ancestors were the heroes immortalized in its pages; what  vast influence must it have had on an ardent, enthusiastic people like the Greeks? Who will say it is visionary to suppose  that Leonidas,and Aristides, Cimon and Agis, received their  first lessons of patriotism from the magnanimous, yet unfortunate Hector? Alexander had always a copy of Homer in  his tent, during his campaigns; and boasted himself an imitator of Achilles, and, like his fierce prototype, was guilty oi  deeds of cruelty and blood.   The K )rnan Scipio did the same,  though he improved upon the model, and softened down its  asperities.  But, in a religious point of view, these two poets exerted  an influence still more lasting and pervading. As a knowledge of the Jewish faith increased by intercourse with din  East, the Greeks, and their servile imitators, the Roman,  borrowed, from thissublime source, many beautiful fragments  of their creed. They affected to despise the credulity of t|1(,  Jews—their poetic genius induced them to seize with avidilv  every thing that suited their taste. After the Christian religion had opined a new dispensation, the Grecian mythology  was so firmly established, that all the reasoning of i&gt;)iilasci-  phy could not defeat its advocates. The ludicrous, and  therefore more caustic satire of Lucian's dialogues, was alone  able to make men ashamed of their childish superstititon   liven after Christianity was established by law, when the  bishops of Constantinople and Rome controlled almost entirely the sceptre's of the e-nslorii and western empires, ninny  of these ancient fibles still clung to the church. Nay, even  no classical scholar can witness the ceremonies, or read tin,  hypoehrapbul doctrines of the Greek and Roman churches,  without discovering a very strong resemblance to mythology, from the pontifex to the vestal, from the sacrifices of Juno to the worship of Ceres. The reason 1 would give for  this inordinate love of mythological fables and ceremonies,  is, their poetical origin and nature. Nothing but the severest system of ethics, can ever eradicate such deep impressions.  The poetry of the Romans was but the reflected image of  that of the Greeks. Virgil was but a copyist of Homer ami  Theocritus, and by consequence lost the fire and energy ef  his great prototypes. However, in refinement of taste, the  son of Mantua has no superior. The age in which he lived  became remarkable for literary excellence. Anil nil will  admit that the corrupt and pusillanimous Octavius became a  better sovereign and a more upright man, after his acquaintance with the virtuous and modest poet. Horace and Ovid  had a tremendous influence on the morals of Rome. It  were impossible to estimate the evil caused by the "De Arte  Amandi." Enough, that even the licentious citizens of the  imperial city were scandalized by it, and the exile of the  hard shows that he was feared. Horace, in his Satires,  created a salutary check- on minor vices: but it is very much  to be doubted whether this was not more than counterbalanced by some of his odes. 1 need enumerate no more of the  profane poets: the above remarks, with little modification,  will apply to all the rest.  The poetry of the Hebrews will sustain the position I have  taken. When the descendants of Israel passed the Red Sea,  and, from its eastern shore, beheld the hosts of Pharoah overwhelmed by the waters, through which they had passed in  safety, had Moses returned thanks to the Deity in plain prose,  his followers would have been outraged by his apathy. By  the beautiful ode composed for the occasion, he swayed all  hearts, and fashioned all feelings as his own. Moses knew  well the human heart, and power of music over the passions  of an ignorant and stubborn race. The commencement of  the song is surpassingly beautiful.

Then Miriam, the  roLihctess, took a timbrel in her hand : and all the women  •,nt out with timbrels and with dances, and responded, with  thrilling accents, "Sing ye to the Lord ; for he hath triumph  ,.| rrloriously. The horse and his rider hath he thrown into  the sea."  For the same reason, do doubt, was it, that some of the  doctrines of 'h« Jewish faith were taught in poetry. The  song of Solomon and the Psalms of David contain much of  die Christian religion. The same truths, related in prose,  would make not hall so deep an impression as they do in  lb,- sublime odes of the monarch bard.  The character of the ancient dwellers in Judea, was similar to the character of their poetry, simple in structure and  raits, hut grand and noble in its subject, and possessing a lofty  morality.     The service of the temple at the daily sacrifice's,  anil the great feasts, and the noble poetry of the psalms, sung  by a thousand voices, swelling in rich thunder on the morn-  iiin- breeze, and melting in waning majesty on the evening's  ear, tended greatly to elevate and solemnize the minds of an  enthusiastic people.     The love of the temple and their pecu  liar rites, was the last feeling which clung to the Jewish heart  when God, in his wrath, gave them up to hardness of heart  an I their numerous crimes deluged the devoted streets of Je  riisalcm with blood.    And never was there a more tremendous outbreaking of bitter anguish, than when the last victim  was slain upon the altar of the Most High, and the solemn  services of the temple ceased.*  The sacred poems seem designed by the God of Israel to  answer a great end.    The descendants of Abraham were a  peculiar people; and  their  peculiarities  were   induced   as  much by prophecy, as the institutions of Moses; and almost  all their prophets wrote in  poetry.    Jehovah spoke by them  in the noblest language.  All descriptions of that great Being,  "who maketh darkness his pavilion, and thick clouds of the  sky;" most of the sublime doctrines of the atonement, and  regeneration of the world by the promised Messiah, are poured out in loftiest strains of majestic verse.    Isaiah, and  Ha-  bakkuk, and Jeremiah, and David, contain thoughts too great  lor mortal grasp, too mighty for utterance; and while we  lean over the sacred page, we can but weep, and pray, and  tremble.    Not only is  it among the ancients that poetry has  exerted so great an  influence.    The moderns arc equally  subject to its control.     The great poems of a language give  character,  in  some  degree,  to those  who speak  it.     The  I''reach, though a highly polished people,  must ever be destitute of superior epics; the genius of the language forbids,  lo the refined and tasteful, they excel; but in the awful grandeur and majesty of epic poetry, they must ever be behind  l™ English.    Their national character is of the same type;  "ght, gay, and sprightly, forever changing, yet always generous, brave, and enthusiastic.  Perhaps in no language on earth, not even excepting the  week, has epic and dramatic poetry reached the same cleva-  110,1 "lat it has in English.    The Greek may claim pre-emi  nence in refinement and polish of diction ; but in moral majesty, it must yield the palm. There is a stern grandeur a  gothtc magnificence, which is equalled only by inspired poets  of the scriptures. I„ these characteristic excellencies, our  Milton is second to none. His Paradise Lost elevates the  mind to an eminence far above all sublunary things. Whether he leads you through the crystal fields of paradise, in the  winged chariot, instinct with life, to the mount of presence,  where resides the Ancient of Days, who, » in the majesty of  darkness, round circles his throne, his glory unobscured •" or,  on the untiring wing of the Archangel, "where utter'nothing dwells," the same mightiness of intellect and perfection  of harmony appears. An imagination unaccustomed to dar-  ing flights, shrinks into itself, and trembles at the vast, the  deep, the gloomy, and the terribly sublime conceptions.  Does he lead you to the perennial fountains, and ever-ver-  lant plains of bliss?  ' Heaven opens wide :  Her everduring gates harmonious sound,  On golden hinges turning,"  to receive the welcome visitant,  mansions of Despair?  Docs he lead you to the  " On a sudden open fly,  Willi impetuous recoil, and jarring sound,  The infernal doors,and on their hinges grate  Harsh thunder."  "'.i"' Batttthlol,  Beings, not the offspring of a diseased mind, hideous, deformed, satyr-like, meet your gaze; beings who have not lost all  f their "original brightness, whose expansive forms and  noble countenances, show proud intellect, blasted by sin,  "great, though in ruins, horribly illustrious: " as you urge  with fevered haste, your way "through the palpable obscure,"  the vivid lightnings "blaze sulphureous," the thunders crash,  and globes of iron hail, glowing with the terrors of Omnipotence, fall, with fearful weight, on objects of eternal wrath.  Trembling, you seek the upper light.  Few can read Milton, and not be deeply impressed with  the fearful consequences of crime, and the beauty of virtue.  [ really do believe, that no one can read Milton's Paradise  Lost, without receiving lessons which he can never forget.  Nay, he who can pass through that work, and not stop to  ponder on the sense, and even pray, must have more stoicism  than commonly falls to the lot of man. The moral and reli-  ious influence of such poems, must be powerful. One fact  ■ill suffice. Nothing is more common than the quotation of  this poet by enthusiastic Christians So universally diffused  are his thoughts on religious subjects, that they arc confounded with revelation. And not unfrequently the eloquent  preacher draws as largely from this fountain of sublimity as  from the Bible itself.  Cowper, as a religious poet, stands next to Milton. In  reading the works of the latter, we do not think of the poor,  old, blind man; but, in the works of the former, we become  .ill acquainted with the author. A man of excellent heart  d great genius, but one who shows his weakness in every  page.

He has not, it is true, the majesty of Milton ; but his winning mildness has moral influence  quite equal to that or the prince of English epic. No bad  man ever loved to read Cowper, The following extract exemplifies this remark:  "Oh, for a lodge in some vast wildclncss!  Some boundless contiguity of shade,  Where rumor of oppression and deceit,  Of unsuccessful or successful war,  Wight never reach me more!    My ear is pained,  My soul is sick with every day's report  Of wrong and outrage, with which earth is filled.  There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart:  It does not feci for man: the natural bond  Of brotherhood is severed, as the flax,  Thai falls asunder at the touch of fire."  In moral and religious poems of excellence, the English  language is very rich. Our Young, Banyan, Rogers, Campbell, Montgomery, challenge competition. It is a fact, likewise, that those who speak the English, have more weight ol  moral and religions character, than all the rest of the civilized world. Whethet this character or our poetry be th  cause or the eflect, the case is a strong one, in favor of the  position I have taken, that poetry forms the character.  No kind of writing is so captivating to most readers as  dialogue, because, perhaps, various opinions are expressed on  the same subject, and the charms of sprightly conversation,  mid the powers of poetry arc combined. There are delicate  shadesof character, which cannot be described. It requires  the voice and expression or countenance, and graphic gesture,  fully to exhibit them. There is a mingling of opposite  principles, a blending of good and evil in the human heart,  which nothing but the skilful hand of the dramatist can bring  out in their just proportions. The theatre has become a  school of vice; because intrigue, treachery, and licentiousness, are the distinguishing characteristics or the plays. The  fatalism resorted to by writers who are incapable ol' inventing a consistent and natural plot, to bring about the catastrophe, is another feature highly objectionable. It destroys that  balance of powers in the young mind, and saps the foundation ol healthy morals. The fearful corruption of morals in  France, and the desperate depravity of taste, first began to  show itself on the stage. Thence it descended to novels and  tales; and now a novel, to be popular, must contain at least  murder or adultery.  English comedy, though not so bad in this respect, is by-  no means free from the charge of immoral tendency. Our  tragedy is of a different character. To Shakspeare, we are  no doubt, indebted for its high moral tone. It is fastidious  affectation to condemn the great masterof the drama for want  of delicacy, lie wrote to represent human nature as it is,  with all its beauty and all its blemishes. So peif'ect are his  portraitures, so exact in every lineament; with such a master  pencil does he blend the lights and shades of character, thai  we become acquainted with every dramatis persona. II  there be any legitimate objection to   reading Shakspeare, it   stbe.reduced to  this, that a knowledge of the human  heart is dangerous to a feeble mind.  Shakspeare, I have always regarded as the father of mental  philosophy. He presents the workings or mind Under so many circumstances, that every faculty is laid open to inspection.  In his plays we have every grade of intellect, from the p,„  fesscd buffoon to the grave philosopher, each speaking hi,  own language. Take one example—Hamlet. Observe bow  the great mind of that unhappy prince strives (or inasterv  over ferocious passions, and struggles with temptations too  [strong for even his generous and virtuous disposition to overcome. And in tin; general breaking up of mental and moral  restraints in the sad catastrophe, the desperate energy and J,,  termined revenge, give one of the finest bird's eye views of  the mind diseased, to be found on earth. This is but one  from a thousand instances ol' his matchless power, '["y  influence of such a poet cannot be calculated. If all thc-  ideas, all the insight into human character, all the language  of passion, that come directly or indirectly from Sliakspeare,  were to be subtracted from the English language, they could  not be supplied in a century. People who read such worta  must and will think, and their modes of thinking will [,,,  fashioned on their models.  Lyric poetry has always occupied a prominent place in  the literature of every country. Its influence is not so pervading and permanent as the epic, because its compass ii  more circumscribed. But in its own proper sphere it acts  with even more power. Perhaps the reason is that tlio point  of an ode being single;, the mind fastens on it more strongly,  than if it were complex. The immoral tendency of Anac-  reon and Horace is urged by those who object to the study ef  thenncient languages, as an ai jument to support their case.  Many a pure mind, say they, has been poisoned by the licentious odes of Horace. 1 do not adopt this argument as tiin.  but to show that I am not singular in my opinion, that potts  exert great influence on character. Some one, I know not  who, has very justly remarked, "give me the writing of th«  songs and ballads of a nation, and I care not who makes the  laws." The songs of Burns, in the Scottish dialect, are quite  equal to any lyrics of any age or country. His name is held  in such detestation by the Kirk, that it cannot be mentioned  in the presence of u rigid deacon, without receiving an anathema. And why? Not because he wrote bad poetry, bill  because he attacks the dogmas of the church in his songs, and  it fears him. I need not speak of the demoralizing influence  of Byron and Rochester. These, and some others, contain  mines of putrid thought.

They are constructed with flat roofs, and ,  intf crothe jocund sun hail lilted up his ruddy face to light    ' "  ihc day, the announcement of a sail ahead broke short the  ■bread of our indifferent dreams, and, among the rest, we has-  trued to the deck, and, with eager eyes, peered through the  mists of the receding night, to catch n glimpse of the imperfect object. Perhaps it is an island, perhaps a phantom, or  the Flying Dutchman, of wizzard memory, who comes to  ask, what news from Holland, and honor us with letters to  his consigners ; were speculations uttered by the yawning  crowd, as they leaned wondering over the rail. But no: it  proved to be a ship—an English ship—bound to the Indies,  and carrying human beings like ourselves. Our swifter ves-  F,.| socn brought US under the stranger's lfp, where we exchanged the usual salutations of Ship ahoy ! What is your  name! Where arc you hound? &c. These courtesies  performed, our jolly-boat was lowered, and, half prepared,  some ol'us jumped into the leaky craft, and pushed off fir  the English ship, unmindful of our danger, determined, at all  hazards, to view once, more the human face divine in woman's  garb; for we had not omitted to observe, that our more favored friend could boast of softer forms and brighter countenances, than the rough specimens of the human race by  which we were surrounded.  Our hasty \isit was soon paid, and we returned, well satisfied lo bear the remnant or our lengthened voyage, without a  murmur, and everyday we thanked our propitious stars for  si tilling us an incident for such pleasing reminiscence.  A lew short weeks or prosperous winds wafted  us across  the southern ocean, and brought us off the island of Ceylon,  with its spicy groves, and ever-living verdure, that garden-  spot in which some  eastern  sages have located the  place  where our first parents learned the punishment of their disobedience; and, as we approached, the land breeze sent sweet  odors from the aromatic herbage forth to meet us—a fitting  welcome to a land made sacred by its fairy fable, its genii, its  necromancy, and enchantments,    My imperfect pen cannot  describe the beauty of the scenery that gradually opened to  our view, as we sailed pleasantly along the Coromandel  coast.     The gorgeous brilliancy of an eastern clime, mad,  more impressive by its novelty ; the sanded beach here and  there studded with a tall cocoa-nut or lalipat, lifting their lofty  summits to the clouds; the distant foaming surf reflecting  hack the vivid lustre or a tropical sun, glimpses of swarthy  forms afar, dressed in the peculiar attire of the country, conspired to fill the mii-.d with a thousand pleasing emotions, pe  culiar to one about to visit a remote country,  and, in this  easc.a land made mcmoiublo by its antiquity, memorable by  its connection with history during its romantic ages, renowned as the land of the Brahmin polytheism, with its temples  and altars, and sacred  Oanges, renowned for its  moslem  mosques, and as the favored country of the song-honored  bulbul.  We came to anchor off Madras, a beautiful city situated  directly upon the coast, and, as seen fioin the offing, exhibiting  a very striking appearance. The houses are large, and have  about them an air of elegance and comfort, that is extremely  . , ,  surround  ed by verandahs, with large columns,  covered with a hard  plastering, called chunam, or great smoothness and beautiful.  ly white.    These, seen against the background oU brilliant  sky, exhibit a tableau of uncommon and  pleasing beauty-  No sooner were we moored, than we descried a small black  speck moving towards us from the shore, resembling somewhat a porpoise swimming along the surface of the water,  with a chaplet of grey moss fastened to his head, hut as the  object approached, we discerned that the subject of our curiosity was a small raft, constructed of two imperfectly hewn  logs fastened together, and denominated a caiamarcn.    On  this were seated two delicately formed men, or diminutive  taturc.    They came along-side, and actively mounted to the  deck, calling out in broken English for " de capum," to whom  they presented a message from the  Custom House.    The  catamaren boatmen live half of their time in the water, and  on their apology for a boat, trust themselves three or four  miles from the shore, at times when the terrific surf forbids  all other communication between the vessels and the shore. At  such times, these little creatures will venture out, and brave,  the fury of the breakers, when they seem to threaten with  destruction every object that dares encounter their violence.  They seem to lie a kind of amphibii well calculated to form  the connecting link between the human species and the residents of the deep.    The morning after our arrival off Madras,  we prepared to go on shore, and entered a boat  constructed  especially lor riding the surf, made or flexible materials, arid  loosely put together, the joints of which are united by twine  made of a tough sea grass, the fissures between the planks  being stuffed with the same material—though so imperfectly  is this part or their construction accomplished, that innumerable chinks are left, through which the water and day-light^  that enter on one side, may find egress on the other.    This  boat was managed by eleven mer, the whole equal  in force  lo two or three stout-bodied Americans.    Having pushed off.  they pulled us steadily along, keeping time with their voices,  n a tone half singing and half grunting, until we reached  the breakers.    They then broke forth into a louder and more  earnest vociferation, at the same lime making a more rapid  mount with their oars.    Taking advantage of the swell, we  soon reached the beach; and while the boat floated in the still  water of a broken wave, the boatmen jumped into the water,  and quickly hauled the boat sidelong upon the beach, rolling  us all out, like so many fish tumbled from a seine, while the  waves, striking the side of the boat, dashed their salt spray entirely over our heads, to the no small discomfiture  of our  carefully adjusted garments.    We had not fairly made our  escape from the spray and the surf, when we were beset by a  crowd or clamorous natives, who thronged around us, offering  their services with an importunity that seemed unconscious of  the natureof a negative.    Some we pushed aside; others we-  threatened to knock down with our umbrellas; but we soon  found, like the fox in the ruble, that it would be belter to sub  mit to the annoyance of one crowd, which would keep off all  other intruders, than to be tormented by a repetition of new  comers, since all the reply they deigned to make to one's men  ■■3 ,  • ■A ij\ i  '■'^4s i  ■ ■'• •* ;:i i  - '•*■; 1  Si  '■".'.  :,  '  i  i 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/349	349	350.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/350.jp2

As soon as the news of the arrival of a new ship had been  bruited about, we were visited by all kinds of jugglers, necromancers and musicians, all equally anxious to do something  for our amusement, and all equally averse lo any rejection of  their kind proffers for our entertainment. The jugglers of  this place are probably no! excelled in skill by any in the  world. They perform their legerdemain with a perfection  that will deceive the most rigid scrutiny, 1 bail one of them  brought to my room, and there seated on the Hour, directly  before me, I watched him with tie- closi st attention, without  hopes to propitiate the favor of heaven, and earn eternal honors hereafter. This eminence overlooks a large extent of  beautiful country, generally flat, but here and there relieved  by undulations, that serve to destroy the lameness of a nr,  feet level. The delicacy of the scenery, the softened vista of  objects rendered enchanting by the distance, together UlIj  the proximity or the sacred fire, which is perpetually sending  up its holy incense as an oblation to the throne ol' the most  high, conspire to consecrate this spot to martyrdom, and lo  cast around it a melancholy and unearthly enchantment  which raises the soul above its attachment to the thinc,s „f  earth, and reconciles it to the separation or those ties that bind  it to mortality.  On the road between Madras and the mount, the friends of  being able to detect him in the least particular;  lor.  so per- the lamented bishop  Ileber, have erected a very handsome  fectly was  he enabled to elude my vigilance, that the rogue)cenotaph in commemoration of their respect for his virt  contrived to put a loathsome looking snake into my hand,  which I hud extended for a piece of cork that he held between his thumb and finger. This surprised me the more,  as he wore no garment about the upper part of his body, in  which it might have been concealed; he performed a hun  dred other tricks mid antics, that want of time will not permit me to mention. There were other fellows who exhibited themselves out of doors in the performance of foats of tin  exnmpled dexterity. 1 saw a fellow balance himself upon an  unsupported pole, about eight I'eet high, and, in that position,  (which he preserved without apparent effort,) dexterously  threw into the air three large swords, and caught them again  as they descended. He then took a large round stone, weighing eight or ten pounds, and threw it with great force liir  above his head, and caught it again exactly upon the back or  his neck, where it lodged as firmly as if it had been received  in a socket, lie then lay down upon his back, and, taking  a three-pronged, spear-pointed instrument, hurled it into the  air. and allowed the weapon to fiill directly upon him; but  his dexterity had so directed it, that the spears, in their descent, passed one on each side of his legs, and buried themselves in the earth, without wounding him in the least. This  rash I'eat he performed several times, until we desired him to  desist, and we dismissed him and his companions, after giving  to each a dram of brandy, which, however contrary to their  creed, they plainly evinced was not contrary to their tastes;  for three of them drank oil'a pint or raw brandy, without  one drop of water or other diluent.  One or the first things that a stranger is apt to notice in  Madras, is the beautiful smoothness of the streets and of the  roads in the vicinity. No heavily loaded wagon or cart is  permitted to travel on them; and by this precaution, they are  preserved in a fine condition for carriages and vehicles of  pleasure. One of the most beautiful of these roads, is that  leading to the Mount of St. Thomas, an eminence about ten  miles from Madras, so called from being the reputed spot  where the saint was crucified whose name it bears. In commemoration of the sacred event, a small Catholic chapel  has been erected upon its summit, and upon the altar of the  chapel a fire is kept constantly burning, attended by a holy  father, who thus in humble solitude, has devoted himself to  i lod, and by the penance of his estrangement from the world,  and talents. Almost every spot in India abounds with the  remembrance of the labors and virtues of this worthy mntl  and to none could they more appropriately erect a monument  that should transmit to posterity the honorable distinction of  his name and the glory of his episcopal labors.  The evening after our return rrom St. Thomas, we strolled forth to visit the bazaars; to peep into the temples and spy  out if possible the manners and customs or the natives. During our rambles about the city, we encountered a number of  young persons, male and female, preceded by a man riding  iqion a very small Brahmin ox, blowing a trumpet, followed  by others on foot, making hideous noises on other wind instruments. These were followed by girls bearing baskets,  decorated with flowers, anil chanting some words to which  the discord or the wind instruments, seemed a very appropriate accompaniment. Our curiosity prompted us to make inquiry respecting the object and nature of this procession, and  we learned that the girls were bearing presents of congratulation to one of their young acquaintances, who had recently  been admitted to the rights and privileges or a woman.  The precocity of physical development, induced by a warm  climate and by peculiar habits of life, is no where more  strongly exhibited than among the natives of the East Indies,  mil particularly of those on the coast of Coromandel. It is  no uncommon occurrence to see mothers or not more than  eleven or twelve years or age, healing children in theirarms  so delicately small that one might almost imagine that Dean  Swift's story of the Ijilliputs was no fable.  Having transacted our business at Madras, we weighed  anchor, and by*the assistance or favorable winds, were in a  few days oil" the sand heads or the Hoogly. Here we hove  to and anxiously waited for a pilot to guide us safely through  its dangerous passes. We were not however doomed to wait  many hours, as the pilot schooners are ever on the alert to  render their assistance to vessels going up the Hoogly, and we  soon descried something, moving down toward us like a spirit  upon the fiice of the waters, which proved to be the wished  lor pilot vessel; its boat was soon manned and pushed oil,  bringing to us a pilot, not a rough man, in sailor's garb, as I  expected (o see, but a person of very gentlemanly appear-  anco, bringing with him a leadsman, servant and appurtenances to boot—such as trunks, bags, dressing cases, segar.-,  ■E 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/350	350	351.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/351.jp2

Our first business after arriving at Calcutta, was to pro-  tare a house, with servants, furniture, palanquins, baths, and  the other necessary appurtenances of comfortable living in  the east. To live in any thing like respectable style, one  tans! bo encumbered with innumerable expenses, which  though individually trilling, are very important in the aggre-  p"e, Each individual must have his private servant and his  Palanquin, with five bearers. The first performs all the ac-  tustomary duties or a valet, helps to dress and undress you,  rails for your palanquin, carries your keys, secures tho best  dishes for you at table, brings you a bamboo tooth-pick af-  u'r Jour meal, and steals whatever he thinks you have no  "iventory of.

These beautiful roads are watered night and morning, by men who carry water from the tanks in bottles made  of goat skin ; by this process the atmosphere is cooled and  the dust settled, rendering a promenade upon the roads 'extremely inviting nfter the debilitating heatofa tropical day.  In observing the manners and customs of the natives, 1  was forcibly impressed with the uir of antiquity, with which  every thing seemed to be impressed; every custom and habit  teemed to be a perpetuation of the same that have been in existence from time immemorial, faithfully transmitted from  lather to son, and from generation to generation, without the  slightest deviation from the original. Indeed, a rigid adherence to ancient forms, to caste, and to hereditary trades and  professions, is one or the strongest features in the Brahmin  policy and religion. The wise founders of the Hindoo religion, foresaw that a policy which would give employment lo  every member of a redundant population, and specifically assign to each the nature or his occupation, was the only means  lo prevent the distress accruing from the introduction or improvements and innovations or any kind tending to diminish  the number of laborers or materially shorten the lime for the  execution or any branch of industry. The result or such a  policy was the division or the people into a variety or distinct  classes, denominated castes. These divisions have been scrupulously preserved, and every individual is extremely averse  to the performance of any duty not assigned to him by his  particular caste or profession. I once directed one of my  bearers to lead to me a dog that was tied in the yard; he oh  jected to comply on the grounds that he would be transcending the duties of his order, and would consequently lose cast  but this fastidiousness is often a mere subterfuge, in order to  avoid doing any thing for which they are not specifically engaged. But, nevertheless, there is a tenacity in their adherence to the principles laid down and inculcated by the policy  and religion of Brahma, which all the august power or the  English government, and all the force of an example,  strengthened by a relation like master and slave, now exerted  since the time of queen Elizabeth, have not been able to  change. Nor have the ministers or catholic and protestant  Christianity been more succcssnil in their efforts to subvert  the foundations upon which these religious and civil customs  have been erected. For hundreds of years have they withstood the attacks of the sanguine advocates of the tenets of'  Christianity, but so far from gaining proselytes, these latter  have too often only exhibited to the Hindoo the insincerity of]  their pretensions, and by their course of lifo, riveted upon the  heathen a stronger belief in the infidlibility or his own no  lions of Divinity and in the superiority of his own modes of|  religious worship. Some humorous stories are related of|  the happy versatility with which some of the rigid promulgators or the christian faith, have relaxed in their observance  of the stern precepts of religion, and with an easy grace, fallen into the habits of a country and people not a little loose  in their adherence to the rules or a strict morality. A fow  years ago, a company or pious ladies in Boston, a band o(\  christian philanthropists, viewing with painful emotions, the  calamitous ignorance that enshrouded the heathen mind and  obscured the light of revelation and the radiance of that «ni  which is to free the world from the bondage of darkness ft.  led out a missionary, who with liis self-denying spouse, h,-|.|  himself prepared to disseminate ihe principles of chlisliam'h  wheresoever a proper field might open for his labors. Al  that lime, the sickly climes of the east held out honorableit,,  ducements to those who had consecrated themselves to tb.  cause of religion, and as the most appropriate sphere ford-  labors of so devoted a servant, Calcutta was fixed upon as tin  point from which the light of his missionary efforts wast»  radiate upon the inhabitants of that benighted country. ijj,  success, no doubt, was equal to that of hundreds who had ,ltt,.  ceded him, but the number of his converts, it was never n;»  good fortune to learn. My acquaintance with him was alio-  gethei of the convivial order, and I can bear ample testimony  to his hospitality, which it was my good fortune to enjoy spy  oral times at his villa, near Calcutta, where the brilliancy of  his soirees, and the excitement or cards, music, wine unJ  dancing, were wont to make the merry hours pass briskly on.  There is another custom, barbarous and cruel in itself, but  holy in the eyes of the Hindoo, and consecrated to him by its  antiquity, which the severe enactments of English legislation  have had but little influence in preventing. I have allusion  to that religious infatuation which prompts the deluded widow to purchase exalted honors for herself hereafter by a  dreadful immolation upon the pyre or her deceased husband.  All widows do not subject themselves to this dreadful ordeal,  but occasionally some woman, more ambitious or immortal  fame than her fellows, comes forward as a voluntary sacrifice  to gratify the tastes of a people who exult in the exhibition of  any torture that is endured as a religious penance. I waj  twice deceived, when I expected to be present during the ceremonials or this painful rite, for the native who had promise!  to give rne secret information of the contemplated burning;  took the precaution of informing me too late, that I might not  have it in my power to prevent the ceremony by any him  given to the officers of government.  The higher castes of Hindoos usually hold themselves aloof  from all persons save those of their own order. They will  hardly condescend, under ordinary circumstances, to enter a  room when you are sitting- at meal, and would feel themselves highly degraded by touching any vessel fiom which a  Christian had eaten : but they will sometimes so far lay aside  their prejudices, as to give sumptuous entertainments, at their  own houses, to their American and European friends.

He even scrupulously avoided touching anythingthat  had been handled by the unholy fingers of his guests, but I  could not help suspecting, that he had too much good sense to  relinquish to his paynim friends all the good things that  gastronomy has invented for the world. Indeed his rich  looking complexion, and well developed proportions, bore  practical testimony against his ascetic abstinence. The  amusements or the evening consisted or rough music by native' performers, who emulated each other's skill by making  all kinds of hideous noises upon wind instruments, adapted  both for the nose and the mouth. During the concert, a troop  of dancing girls made their appearance, tastefully dressed  ami decorated with large silver rings upon their arms and  ankles, and suspended from their noses and ears, which kept  up a constant jingling during the exhibition of their performances. Their dancing consisted of active gesticulations  with their feet and arms, and a variety of constrained postures and proportions, which, upon the whole, seemed very  much in accordance with the harsh sounds called music to  which they were moving.  Near Calcutta, resides one of those Hindoo princes, whom  the crafty policy of the English government has permitted  to enjoy a nominal existence.    But the once powerful authority or the Rajah has departed with the usurpation that made  his ancestors slaves, and subjected his hereditaments to the  control of foreign potentates.    The residence of this princ  is usually denominated the Rajah's garden, and is acccssibl  to all strangers who will observe the formality of leaving a  card at his house.    Of these he has a great number, some  with names of exalted personages, of which he is not a little  vain.    His demesne is handsomely enclosed, and tastefully  laid out in well kept walks.    The garden, in lieu of the  usual decorations of such places, is lilted up with spacious  and commodious cages, in which are confined a multitude or  animals of great variety and beauty, wdio seem to have lost  nothing or their natural fierceness by the kind or imprisonment to which they are here subjected.    Other apartments  are fitted up for birds or most singular and beautiful plumage,  While the tanks afford accommodation to fishes and aquatic  hinls.    Of the latter,  I noticed  several  fine specimens of  'he black swan.    Among his animals, arc a few or the large-  tailed sheep rrom the Capo or Good Hope.    Two or three  °f Iheso sheep had tails of such enormous size, that it was  found necessary to relievo the animal of the weight, by means  °' a contrivance like  a cart, fastened to the sheep by means  °' straps, and in this way dragged about with the tail in it.  When I witnessed this singular and laughable spectacle, it  forcibly brought back lo my recollection the words of the  ol  nursery song, that I used to hear when a little child:—  Lnlle Bopecp has lost his sheep, and don't know where to  find them.    Let them alone, aud they'll come home, a dragging their tails behind them."  Heretofore the lucrative trade of the east has been a prolific source of wealth to the merchants engaged in that business, and many persons have amassed immense- fortunes in  that country, some of whom have returned to Europe, to enjoy their ill health, and disburse their treasures;  but  others  have become so wedded to the habits and luxuries of the  east, that they arc unwilling to encounter the disruption ol'  their old associations and the formation or new ones. Among  those who have learned to be contented with the place where  they acquired the means or purchasing pleasure, is an opulent Spaniard, formerly a merchant or Calcutta, but now residing a few miles below the city, at an elegant villa upon  the bank or the Ganges.    There he lives in all the splendor  of an eastern nabob, keeping for his amusement two or three  elephants, trained   to the sport or tiger hunting.    Several  times a year, mounted on one or these powerful and sagacious  animals, and attended by his servants,  he makes excursions  into the adjacent country, and, attacking the tiger in his native jungle, drives him from his retreat, and 'mid the exulting  yells of the native population, forces his untameoble nature to  yield sovereignty to man.    A tiger hunt is an occasion of no  small interest to the natives, as this prowler of the wilderness  not unfrequently makes incursions into the villages, carrying  ofl goats and bullocks, and when pressed  by hunger, he is  not fastidiously particular in  avoiding their children, and  when the huntsmen  are known  to be in pursuit of one of  these terrors, they turn out with spears, knives, and other  missiles,  to assist, if it be necessary, in his extermination.  The elephant is prepared for hunting, by having a frame  work, something like a carriage body, firmly strapped upon  his back.    It is denominated a houda, and  usually contains  two compartments: one in front, with a seat large enough to  accommodate two or three persons; and the other for the servants, who stand behind and  load the rifles.     During a visit  that I was paying to this gentleman, news was brought that a  tiger or immense size was prowling about one or the native  villages, a mile from his residence.    The next morning we  got all ready and started at day light, pursuing a rough road  through the woods and bushes, until we arrived at the aforementioned village.    Here we were met by a great number  of natives, armed with spears, knives, and bludgeons, who  hailed our approach with shouts and acclamations of joy.—  We then took the direction of a jungle a mile and a half  from the village, the elephants pushing along at a sweeping  rate, seeming to feel that they were in pursuit of some object  of great interest.    We had not proceeded far in the jungle,  ore the elephants gave intimation of our approach to the beast,  by a restless movement of the proboscis and a quicker step,  flu's put every one on the qui vivc, and while awkwardly  looking about, 1 was startled by the report of a rifle, fired by  my companion, whose keen and practised eye had discovered  the tiger skulking at the edge or a thick body of long grass  and reeds.    A shout from some natives, and a loud yell from  the elephant, followed the report of the rifle, and I turned  ny head with the expectation of seeing the body of"a dead or  dying ti"-er; but with astonishment I beheld the terrific moa-  ° VOL,   I.—IX.  • htm  ■ml  i   .

Belying, perhaps,  upon an instinctive consciousness of their own power,these  animals never go any great distance from the place where  they are first disturbed. Consequently, we soon came up  with him again, and fired four rifles at him in quick succession, all of which took eflect; but there is a tenacity of life  about the feline species, that sometimes verifies the adage,  that cats have nine lives; for notwithstanding the tiger appeared lo have been rendered poweiless by the leaden missiles that had entered his body, as we approached him, he  speedily evinced that he was neither dead, nor his nature subdued : his fierce rolling eyes flashed defiance, and he sprang  towards us with a ferocity that indicated a determination to  sell his life at the price or human sacrifice. I was tremulous with apprehension, lest he would attack the unprotected  Hindoo, who was seated upon the head of our elephant; for  vengeance was depicted in every movement; but he could  not withstand the repulsive power of the rifle balls that were  rapidly fired at him, and, bristling with agony and rage, he  retreated to a small cluster of trees, where he awaited our  coming with an aspect of dogged enmity. We fired upon  him again, as we approached, when, as if aroused by the incarnation of a dozen demons, he made a fierce and terrible  assault upon us, and, uttering a savage growl, he sprang upon our elephant, and buried his sharp teeth and claws deeply  in the fleshy proboscis. This was a moment to me or indescribable excitement. But the sagacious creature upon whom  we were mounted, did not wait to be lacerated by the vindictive weapons ol" his foe; for, quicker than thought, lie hurled  him to the earth, and then, planting his ponderous foot upon  the body or the tiger, crushed him to death. Thus terminated our tiger hunt, and f now have in my possession the  enormous head and skin vi' this animal, that were preserved  as- trophies ol' the exploit.  The day after our adventure down the river, I was invited  to visit an antique looking ship, belongingto the government  ol' Cochin China, which had but just arrived for the purposi  ol' c igotiating some facilities of trade between the East Indie  Company and the Cochin Chinese, but instead of gratifica  tion, which such a visit at any other time would have afforded me, I was doomed to encounter one of those revulsions of[  feeling, that the members of oil' profession are too often call  ed to experience. On board was a young man, who had  been employed in the capacity of navigator, and while coming up the river he had been nssailed by the terrific scourge  which in that country carries off its thousands and tens of  thousands, and whose destroying besom more recently visited our country, spreading desolation and woe through our  streets at mid-day. He had partially recovered from the first  shock of the disease, but had fallen into that typhoid condition that not unfrequently ensues after reaction. 1 saw him  just as the flame of life was flickering in its socket, emitting  those vivid and transient bursts or light which indicate the  approach of a speedy and total extinction. He informed me  that ho was an American, rrom the neighborhood ol' .,  and impelled by the feeling of satiety that some limPS I(,|.  possession of young and ardent minds, had left his home and  kindred to seek for that pleasure and happiness which be  had regarded as an entity to be found and then to be possessed. He was disposed to dwell upon the premature intorrtin-  tion to the career which his fancy had marked out for him  and decorated with the most pleasing anticipations; not however with a spirit of animadversion upon the unphtlosophi-  cal tendency of his imaginings, for he still clung to the belief that this world contained all the elements necessary for  completing the measure of man's desires. All reference to  the future was received with gloomy apathy, and he evinced  a painful contempt in the belief of any consequences that i„.  volved a misery more poignant than what he endured in being thus abruptly cut off from the world and its flattering il.  lusions. The feeling with which he looked forward to his  coining fate, was not that of resignation—there was no pious  quiescence in the justice that had marked the unavoidable  nature of the event which he saw rapidly approaching.   He  desired me to take charge of his effects and to communicate  to his friends the mournful intelligence of his demise, and  then he spoke of dying among strangers anil in a strange  land, with no eye to pity, and no soft hand to smooth hit  aching pillow and wipe from his cold brow the death drop  that had settled there, and in spite of his efforts to maintain  omposure, the thoughts or home and kindred, of a sister's  ;entlc solicitude, and a mother's tremulous affection, wrung  A-oni his susitic heart lamentations that entirely upset all our  abstract notions or manly seff possession.    But he died, and  at sunset we followed  him to his grave, and as  we lowered  him to his vesting place in  the cold earth, the moon rose to  bed her consecrating rays upon the spot where his last sad  ites were solemnized.  The short limits or an essay, forbid the notice or many  places of interest that wc visited, and the many incidents that  were witnessed during my stay in Calcutta, each or which  would demand a separate and lengthened account. In the  mean time, between business and pleasure, the time passed  rapidly away, and after bidding adieu to the pleasures or the  east, our ship was again loosed from her moorings, the anchor weighed, the sails unfurled to the breeze, and every  heart beat high with the anticipation of a safe and speedy  voyage home, but we had not escaped from the dangerous  sand-heads of the Hoogly, when one of the terrific storms of  the south-west monsoon, burst upon us with all its fury. The  very spirit of the tempest seemed unloosed and the waters of  the deep were shaken to their foundations; (he tempestuous  waves rushed from their distant caverns, and dashed their  hoary heads, in wild defiance of the power that bade them  rise; the pregnant clouds gave up their progeny or storms:  the sun withheld his light, arid the pent up winds came forth  to howl their mournful requiem o'er his departed rays. For  nearly two long weeks, our little ship withstood the conflict  of the elements, and finally unscathed escaped the leeward  Andamans, and then capricious nature, aptly called a dame,  deigned once more lo show herseir all smiles and sunshine,  she breathed upon us pleasant and propitious breezes, and  amiable expression shone forth in every feature of her beau- 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/354	354	355.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/355.jp2

As then, preceding dispensations dimly pictured  Forth our own, so Christianity may adumbrate  The grand economy of heaven.

The following is the conclusion of an able essay, published in the Southern Literary Messenger, from the pen of a  itlldent at the  University of North  Carolina:    "ft is now  generally admitted by competent judges, that it is impossible  ,o understand English in all its power, beauty, copiousness,  without a previous acquaintance with the Classics.    Buttle  multitude, in the true spirit of English vanity, arc constantly  proclaiming the entire independence of their language, and  ■amiiingly assert, that it needs no plumage borrowed from  any tongue under heaven.     Mark you ! this was not said  mlil the huge,  misshapen skeleton of the Anglo-Saxon had  received a filling up—a beauty and proportion from the much  ibiiseel Latin and Greek.    Now, as the English language  has declared her Independence,and set up for herself, it isbut  air that she should surrender back  to Greek and Latin the  lnrmonious and expressive words, the poetical imagery, ami  ich mythology which she has stolen from them, but which  ihe has just found out she does not need.     Let  her do this,  tnd what does she become ?—what she was originally.   ii«-  dis indigestaque mole*.

We however have no fears that our boasted vernacular  will be able to sustain her declaration, since Greek and I&gt;0'  man ideas, illustrations, and allusions, are so interwoven »'itk  it, that they have become an inseparable part and parcel of it.

As the bards of antiquity wero the first  to walk forth into the garden of poetry, they did not fail to  appropriate to themselves their most beautiful flowers; they,  having the gathering of the harvest, have left to the moderns  in many branches of the poetic art naught but the mere gleanings of the field. These ancient poems have been so translated, paraphrased, metamorphosed by modem poets, that a  mere English scholar would find nearly as much difficulty  in the works of the latter, as in those of the former. A  glance at one more argument in favor of the learned languages, and this discussion is closed. The history of the forum arid halls of legislation, proves that, in the actual conflict  of mind against mind, the Classical orator has a decided advantage over an antagonist who lias merely an English education, though in every other respect they be entirely equal.

The March number of the Knickerbocker contains the  following notice: The work announced three or four years  since by the Royal Society of Northern Antiquities, of Copenhagen, has just appeared, and reflects great credit on the  society, both for the beautiful style in which it is got up, and  for the valuable historical matter which it contains. The  limits of this article will not admit of a particular synopsis  of the contents of this work. The following Sagas appear  at length in it, and sundry extracts from ancient Danish  manuscripts:  "First the historical accounts of Erik the Red, and the  Greenlanders, extracted—and now for the first time accurately published—from the celebrated Codex Flateyensis, particularly concerning Biarne FIeriulfson's and Leif Er-  ickson's first discovery of the American Islands and Coasts,  and the several voyages thither, performed by Lii.fs brothers  and sister.

The Season of Flowers.—The glad forests, as well  as the fields and each copse of shrubbery, are bursting into  the full bloom of the season of flowers.    The birds, intoxicated with th" aroma of the trees, pour forth their morning  anthems with a more ecstatic note than is their wont; and  life, in mass, seems applausive of nature's vernal array.    But  there are those belonging to humanity, upon whoso lack-  lustra orbs, these splendors fall unheeded.    There are sor  rows and disappointments in life that nullify nature's ministry of pleasure.     Talk not of roses to him of the hollow eye  and the wasted cheek, who feels that ere long his slumbers  shall be too deep for the matins of the birds to waken.    Talk  not of gushing waters, or pearly dews, or spice-scented zephyrs, or the flaunting white and red of the vocal forests, to  him who is doomed by hasty steps to descend into the cheerless vale of poverty.    Lonely, bleak solitude, and deep black  waters are more of the "color of fate."    Yet nature intends  land left by the Iceland Farmer Biorn Johnson of Skardso.  It is now for the first time submitted lo the literary world in  a complete form. The woik here announced, moreover,  contains every thing else that the Society has been able to  collect and discover relating to that knowledge of the New  World which our forefathers obtained from the early discoveries and researches of the Northmen. Among these we  may mention, 1. Adam of Bremen's accounts of Vineland  (in America) written in the eleventh century, being in fact  communicated lo him by the Danish King Sweyn Estrithson,  and compiled from authentic accounts furnished to him by  Danes, and now for the first time published from the excellent Codex in the Imperial Library at Vienna, of which a  fac simile has been transmitted to the Society by the Chief of  the Library, Count Dietrichstein. 2. Are Frode's account  of Vineland, written in the same or in the following century;  and also 3, of the eminent Icelandic chief Are Marson,  one of his own ancestors, who in the year 983 was driven to  a part of America situate near "Vineland, then called Ilvir-  rajiannaland or Great Ireland, whose inhabitants (0!

Ancient  accounts of the most northern districts of Greenland nnd  America, chiefly visited by the Northmen for the purpose ol  hunting and fishing; among these a very remarkable account  (from a letter of a Greenland clergyman) of a Vovaoe of  Discovery undertaken by some clergymen from the Bishopric of Gardar in Greenland, in the year 1260, being—as is  corroborated by an astronomical observation—throuoii  Lancaster Sound and Barrow's Strait to regions  which in our days have for the first time been made correctly known through the zealous exertions of Sir William Parry, Sir John Ross, and Captain James (.'lark Ross, and other  British navigators. 8. Extracts from the ancient geographical works of the Icelanders, to which is added an outline taken in the thirteenth century, representing the earth in four  inhabited quarters, 9. An ancient Faroish Ovaji wherein  Vineland is named, and allusion is made to its connexion  with Ireland. "  There is another class of antiquities, to which allusion has  been made, which are of great importance in elucidating the  history of the North. They are lo the Scandinavian people,  what the monumental inscriptions of Egypt and Greece are,  in investigating their history. No architectural remains exist, like those of the latter countries, nor do their rude sculptures denote any proficiency in this branch of art. Like the  people by whom they were executed, they are marked with  the rudeness in their execution which characterizes their  works. In archteology, they are denominated 'Runes,' and  consist of rocks sculptured with ancient Runic letters, recording important events which have transpired in the countries where they arc formed. ' Runes ' are common throughout the North of Europe, and have also been found in Asiatic Russia, Siberia, and Tailary. In many instances, rude  obelisks, from t.-u to twenty feet in height, are found with inscriptions, an I in others, smooth or natural-faced rocks on  the banks of rivers, or on prominent points in the interior.  In America, and particularly in the northern states, inscribed rocks are known to exist, which, in some respects, are  analogous to those of Europe and Asia. The most celebrated of these is the. Dighton Rock in Massachusetts.    It is situ  ated on the banks of Taunton river, and has, since the fl™  settlement of the country, attracted the attention of the ami.  fjuarians, both of America and Europe.*  A BEDOUIN CAMP,  n v   no.v.  j. s.   u u e k i n o m a m ,  We reached the Bedouin camp about sun-set, and our reception there was every thing that hopitality could dictatr  Our bands were embraced, and the salutations of peace and  welcome exchanged a hundred times; but as no one claimed  the exclusive privilege of entertaining us, we were taken lo  a large square, formed by embankments of the soil, heighten-  ed by loose bushes, and completely sheltered from Ihe wind,  where the elders of the tribe assembled to smoke their evening pipes, recount the tales of the day, and regale such guests  as business or accident might bring among them from opno  site quarters.  A young kid was immediately killed, and dressed upon the  embers of a brush-wood fire; the milk of goals and camels  was laid before us in bowls, coffee was burned and pounded  upon the spot, and the tobacco-purse of the venerable old  sheik was replenished from his tent for our use. There was,  n short, abundance for the hungry, rest for the weary, and  security for the apprehensive traveller, to be found beneath  the protecting shadow of their encampment, nor could the  feasts of the ancient heroes, which Homer so happily describes, have boasted a more unbounded liberality in iheir  provisions, or a more unadulterated hospitality in the rude simplicity of their preparation.  Delighted with a conversation which brought me acquainted with their manners, customs, nnd opinions, and that, loo,  from a source so satifactory as a large assembly of themselves, in which misrepresentations could not have passed unobserved, I was happy in prolonging our interview, and in  remaining awake through the greater part of the night, engaged in mutual inquiry and reply.  The ground chosen for the encampment of this Bedouin  tribe, was a gentle hollow of the plain, as it could scarcely do-  sorvo ihe appellation of a valley; and their tents, to the number of about three hundred, occupied a space of less than two  miles in circumference. No other order was observed in  their erection, than that of being all open to the eastward, 10  receive the warm and cheering beams of the morning sun:  in summer, when the heats are oppressive, their openings face  the north, to enjoy the refreshing coolness of the winds from  that quarter. These low and brown habitations, formed of  woven goats' hair, differing in shape, size, and manner ol arrangement, and rudely supported by rough boughs of trees,  and cord spun from the wool of their own flocks, were barely  large enough to enclose their respective families at night, and  shelter the infants and infirm in the day.

SOUTH- VV E S T E R N JOURNAL.  143  i husl  band, two wives, and fifteen or sixteen children, besidi  uated wife or mother.  a superomi  The smoke of the morning fires ascending in columns  through a calm and unagitated air, the bleating of the lambs,  which wore carried in the shepherds' arms from tenderness,  Xj, skipping of the hardier kids, the shrill crowing of the cock,  and the barking playfulness of the faithful dog, the departure  of the boys with their respective flocks, nnd of the girls in  .•roups, with pitchers to the wells, the busy occupation of the  wives in kneading cakes of meal for the hearth, with the com.  putative dignity of their grave and bearded lords, presented  altogether so admirable a representation of the patriarchal  life, that I found myself transported back, in imagination, to  the days of the venerable Abraham, and stood in wonder at  the preservation of usages and customs so unaltered among  his descendants, through years and ages which have destroyed  ihe haughtiest empires, created new successors, and swept away  kingdoms, nations, and people, into oblivion !  SAND TEMPEST IN THE DESERT.  The celebrated oriental traveller, now in this country, J.  S. Buckingham, late member of Parliament from Liverpool,  has communicated to the Knickerbocker an account of his  survey of the ancient canal of Sesostris amidst the sands of  Egypt,   He encountered a sand tempest:  "On leaving the site of thase now evaporated lakes, we  entered upon a loose and shifting sand again, like that which  Pliny describes when speaking of the roads from Pelusium  across the sands of the desert, in which he says, unless there  bt reeds stuck in the ground, to point out the line of direction, the way could not be found, because the wind blows up  the sand and covers the footsteps.  "The morning- was delightful, on our setting out; and  promised us a fine day; but the light air from the South had  increased to a gale. The sun became obscure; and getting  every hour into a looser sand, it flew around us in such  whirlwinds, with the sudden gusts that blew, that it was im  possible to proceed, We halted, therefore, for an hour, and  sheltered ourselves under the lee of our camels, who were  Inemselves so terrified as to need fastening by the knees, and  uttered, in their moanings, but a melancholy symphony.  " 1 know not whether it was the novelty of the situation  ;™ gave it additional horror, or whether the habit of magnifying evils to which we are unaccustomed had increased its  ellect; but certain it is, that fifty gales of wind at sea appear-  "1 lo me more easy to bo encountered than one among those  snids. It is impossible to imagine desolation more complete.  " c could see neither earth, nor sun, nor sky. The plain at  '•''" paces distant was absolutely imperceptible : our animals,  !'s well as ourselves, were so covered with the sand as to ren-  '"■''' breathing difficult. They hid their faces in the ground,  and we could only uncover our own for a moment, to behold  "ns chaos of mid-day darkness, and wait impatiently for its  •oaternent. Alexander's journey to the Temple of Jupiter  Amnion, and the destruction of the Persian armies of Cam-  while Addison's admirable lines, which I also remembered  with peculiar force on this occasion, seemed to possess as  much truth as beauty.  ' So where our wide Numitlian wastes extend,  Suiblcn ihe impetuous hurricanes descend;  Wheel through Ibc air, in circling eddies play,  Tear up the sands, anil sweep whole plains away:  The helpless traveller, with wild surprise,  Sees ihe dry descel all around him rise,  And smothered in the dusty whirlwind dies.'  " The few hours we remained in this situation were passed  in unbroken silence. Every one was occupied in his own  eflectior.s, as if the reign of terror forbade communication.  " The fury of the desert gale spent itself, like the storms  of ocean, in sudden lulls and squalls; but it was not until the  third or fourth interval, that our fears were sufficiently conquered to address each other; nor shall I soon lose the recollection of the impressive manner in which that was done.  ' Allah kcreem!' ' God is merciful I' exclaimed the poor Bedouin, although habit had familiarized him with these resistless blasts. 'Allah kereeml' repeated the Egyptians, with  terrified solemnity; and both my servant and myself, as if by  instinct, joined in the general exclamation. The bold imagery of the eastern poets, describing the Deity as avenging in  his anger, and terrible in his wrath, riding upon the wings of  the whirlwind, and breathing his fury in the storm, must have  been inspired by scenes like these.  " It was now past sun-set, and neither of us had yet broken  our fast for the day. Even the consoling pipe could not be  lighted in the huriicane, and it was in vain to think of remaining in our present station, while the hope of finding  some bush for shelter remained. We remounted our camels,  therefore, and departed. The young moon afforded us only  a faint light, and all traces of the common road were completely obliterated. The stars were not even visible through  so disturbed an atmosphere, and my compass was our only  guide. The Arabs knew a spot, near Sheick Amedid, where  banks and trees were to be found; and confiding in my direction for the course thither, we resumed our journey.  " After a silent ride of five tedious hours, this garden of repose appeared in sight; and, bleak and barren as it was, in  truth, fatigue and apprehension gave it the charms of Eden.  Here we alighted, fed our weary animals, and like sailors  scaped from shipwreck, rrjoiced in that delightful consciousness of security, which is known only in the safety that succeeds danger."  yscs in the Lybian  Desert, rose to my recollection, with  W impressions made by the horror of the scene before me;  An Extraordinary Mkteor.—The Liverpool Chronicle contains an account of an immense meteor, which had  fallen about sixty leagues from Rio Janeiro, as large as a balloon. It shivered to pieces, and the aerolites, (meteoric  stones) were buried deep in the sand. It was accompanied  with a noise like thunder. One piece of the stone weighed  eighty pounels. No human lives lost; but several cattle  were killed.  Sorrows are but the clouds which darken our skies, while,  at the same time, they shelter us from the fierce glare of the  sun of prosperity.  1  $&\\  1 lv  I /  A 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/359	359	360.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/360.jp2

Perti-  nncity, the sin of imbecilo minds, will ever find an antidote in  open and manly discussion.  It is presumable that tho utility of such associations as  Ibis will be disputed by none, though the field of their operation rnny not be apparent to all. A few remarks on this subject, therefore, will not be deemed irrelevant.  Unassisted individual effort, with no other facilities than  those derived from ihe present advanced slate of science, may  achieve great things; but the combination of many energies,  will accomplish more, tine innn, by patient study, may perfectly master any subject; but the united industry of many  can perform the same with at least as much ability, and certainly with less labor to each. Thus, an essay may be written with taste and talent, yet when tried in the ordeal of criticism, faults of both style and thought may be discovered,  which have entirely escaped the writer's notice. So, likewise,  .1 lecture or other paper may be composed with profound  erudition and reach of mind, yet from the misapprehension of  a principle, errors of magnitude may have been made, which  free discussion will point out and correct.    Few persons  But when many branches of learning are cultivated and discussed, ench person may easily perceive the adaptation of his  talents for any one. A force is thus applied, and a direction  thus given, that may eventuate in consequences valuable, exalted and illustrious.  We must not, however, expect to have in our little society  those towering geniuses, that   "through learning and tlirough fancy take  Their flight sublime: and on the loftiest top  Of Panic's dread mountain sit."  Our imaginations must not lead us to anticipate more than  can be performed by common minds. It is the genius that  invents and disc.oveis, but it is the man of common, everyday  sense, who matures, and reduces to practice the suggestions of  the former, which were perhaps accidental and but half understood. Common men constitute the mass of mankind; a  genius appears hut once in an age, and like the comet may attract all eyes by its eccentric flight, and perchance, show,  through its luminous emanation, some little star before unseen.  Union of effort, in ordinary men, will generally effect more  beneficial results than any solitary genius. The lightning,  that springs from the bosom of the slorm, carrying havoc  and devastation in its course, and making the solid eaith tremble, slumbers unseen and unfelt in the subtile vapour that floats  iew n subject in the same light, and various presi illations oflin the atmosphere: so in n community there may not be one  ilie same idea may be, nnd generally are, of great importance person whose capacity distinguishes him above others, yet,  lo ensure accuracy and precision of thought.

In another light are associations of this kind useful to the  members. The taste of the present age has been much deteriorated by torrents of light, trifling matter, called literature.  "The press teems with books and other productions that bear  this imposing title." Perhaps a better definition of fnshionn-  able literature could not bo given, than this: words of learned  length, end beautiful phrases socollocaudund arranged as to  produce harmonious sound, witli little regard to sense.    The  suns does not give rise to the same association of ideas. To  increase the number of ideas in an association of ideas, on  given subject, is not only lo increase the amount of know-  any  ledge on that subject, hut In enlarge the powers of appn hen-  sion and perception. Besides, truth is more certainly obtained by a comparison of diverse opinions and various processes  of reasoning.

Both may do much to honor their country: But it  is tho steady, silent efforts of the unobtrusive citizen, that form,  strengthen and dignify the national character.  Never since the creation of the world, has there been such  a universal thirst for knowledge.    " From tho rivers to the  ends of the earth," from the mountains to the sea, the desire  seems insatiable. Among people, over whose benighted minds  scarcely a ray of intellect has ever beamed; over whom superstition, with her iron sceptre-, has long ruled, enthroned in  bloody rites nnd surrounded by revolting ceremonies, the way  is open for the introduction of science and religion.    The cry  for truth comes floating on every breeze.    All are alive lo  the glorious hope of moral and mental revolution.    This may  he the direct agency of an all-bountiful providence, or it may  he the legitimate results of the benevolent efforts now making  by American and European Christians.    Be the cause what  it may, the effect is astounding.    The whole mass of human  mind isin motion, and, like the ocean tossed by storms, it cannot be restrained.    Mighty swell after mighty swell breaks in  resistless thunder over kingdoms and empires ;—thrones, and  principalities, and powers, that seem founded in adamant nnd  h mss, quiver under the deafening shock ; and their sandy foun  dations are laid bare.    Despots are making their last desperate  efforts to arrest the rapid advances of mind.    They mio-ht as  well attempt to "gather the beams of ihe noon-day sun and  weave them into a mantle of darkness;" ihey might as well "-o  stand upon tho beach, and tracing u line in the sand with theii  sceptres, say to the ocean, "thus far shall thou go and no firth  or;'' they might as vvellgoto (he giant cataract of the North  and say, Niagara, stand still!    Nay, the cataract may be si  lince.1, thestormy sea may he calmed, the "sun may he turned  lo darkness," but Ihe intellect, once awakened, cannot bo restrained,    liaise obstacles high as heaven, it will surmount  them ; sink barriers deep us ihe centre of ihe world, it will up-  stand forth redeemed and disenthralled. But this influence  will not stop here; it will pass through Europe, Asia and  Africa, and move on until every nation and tribe under heaven, shall feel tho renovating spirit of our free institutions,  breathe the pure atmosphere, and Freedom find a home  among every people.  But it is not our political institutions alone that are held  up lo tho gaze of the world. Americans are too much disposed to think, because their country is esteemed the polar  star by which all steer to the sure haven of political liberty, that  ill is done that need be done. They are grievously mistaken who think so. We cannot remain stationary a single  moment. If we improve our advantages, wc shall advance  with the same rapidity that has characterized our rise heretofore. If wc neglect them, our fall will be covered with double shame.    It argues want of magnanimity to rest content,  " To be known because our fathers were."  The founders of our republic began a glorious work, which  wc, their descendants, must finish or destroy They achieved,  by the sword, our independence; it remains for us to earn a  reputation for learning and intelligence. Our claims in this  respect must not bo too arrogant: Honor must be clearly deserved before it is received. Military fume alone cannot  render a nation illustrious; nor can the excellence of political institutions alone. Athens could not boast as many free  men as some of our smallest cities, though, in inhabitants,  she far out-numbered the largest; yet Athens ruled Greece,  and formed the taste, and softened the manners of her fierce  conquerors; and victorious Rome yielded a willing obedien  to the superior genius of conquered Greece.

THE LIMITED NATURE OF HUMAN RESEARCH,  \s Ussav, r,-.,il boforo (in- JcnVrson College nnd Washington Lyceum,  . V,-. M0M8TTH) .'I  U,  Mr, President, and Ladies ami Gentlemen,—The  Psalmist lets beautifully observed, " When I consider ihe  heacens th&lt; work of thy fingers, the moon, ami the stars  which thou, hast ordained, what is man Hint thou nit mindful o/him?"  I low vain lor man to suppose, that nil nature was made  tor his use; to supply his wants: to minister lo his pleasure;  &lt;ir to contribute to his exaltation: that all tho grand operations  of earth and heaven, with all their diversified relations, are  carried mi solely for his good; tiny the sun holds his throne  in tie- heavens, with all his system of planets revolving  around him; thai (he seasons perform their annual rounds;  that tho ample storehouse of naturo's mysteries is provided,  all for his use! Truly they must have an overweening estimate of man's importance, who can adopt such a conclusion.  Tho whole creation, this as wi II as oilier systems, none  can doubt, boars evidence of the wisdom anil goodness of]  (!od, in adapting every thing, however great or small, to one  : al .' i. ,\-:i us:-, as well as to the particular use, nnd happi-  i. .-   .; ■'.'   individual creatures, constituting tho great chain  '• .'■ ..'-. 'flu's adaptation of parts and uses,is traced,|  i.t ;,-! :,i.-.i to each other, no', only in the grad :s of animal  a.i.l ,,i' vegetable life, bui also to the greater relations of oni  planet to another. Even in the structure of the earth, while  the superficial strata are performing an agency i-'.- sustaining  and perpetuating animal and vegetable life, in tho various  orders which exist upon, or ni ar its surface, we have reason  to believe, that tie- interior strata, to its c, ntrc, may he elaborating tint powerful, invisible, and mysti rious fluid, which  holds the earth in its relative station, and regulates ail its  motions; while, at the same time, it retains smaller bodies in  their duo relation lo the t arth.  Ail the orders of animals, from the largest down lo the  smallest; from tho Megatherium of an antediluvian world,  down to tho thousands ol animalculrn, which swarm in a  drop of water, or cluster in a fragment of rock ;—seem formed fir their own happiness; to lill up the grades in creation;  nnd lo sustain other orders of being. Each is governed by  its own peculiar laws; each derives support from oilier orders  of animals, alive or dead; while it, in turn, affords sustenance for others.  in each component particle of mailer there arc certain  laws, or certain rules of adaptation by which each particle is  constituted an independent whole, nnd yet is a pari of another  whole; to which ii, bears its proper relation. Even in a matin matical point of view, take up Ihe most irregular piece of  matter, and it will be found to have, mysteriously interwoven  in it, an almost unlimited series of squares, cubes, rhombs,  spheres, and cones; and yet it extermally exhibits no evidence ol  either of those figures. How many laws of matter may he-  concealed in like manner from our view, we know not; and in  most instances, even whore we think we know all, we know  comparatively nothing.  In relation to tile facts, the agencies, influences, or laws regulating the operations and existences of all the bodies in  nature, man, who is but an atom in creation, with his limited  number of senses, can expect to acquire a knowledge of only  a few fads, and a few principles. Even the towering geniuses of such men as Bacon, Locke, Kepler, Newton and Laplace, could obtain only faint glimpses, of a few, comparatively, of tho profound mysteries involved in the economy ol  ihe world. The great mass, the wide fields of knowledge,  lay beyond their reach, locked up as in an impenetrable arcanum from the scrutiny of man.  A knowledge of the laws, which regulate matter and spirit,  so fiir as man can truce them, is called science; the attainment of which, however difficult and abstruse, constitutes one  of the greatest intellectual pleasures which we can enjoy.—  Tin- pleasure of discovery is in direct proportion lo the increased difficulty of investigation, if our minds could seize  upon principles and hidden facts with that perspicuity, which  angels may possess, constituted as we are, the interest, the desire of knowledge, the novelty of discovery, the pleasure of  gratified curiosity would not he ours. The vigorous intellect would sink into satiety and inglorious indolence. For tho  greater tho mystery, the more a subject is hedged in with  uncertainty and doubt; where hypothesis upon hypothesis is  exhausted in the solution, the more attractive is it lo the restless genius of man. His mind is continually in search of  something intricate for its operation, some difficulty to unra-  vt 1: for strange as it is, his mind seems disgusted with simplicity in all its forms, and turns to investigate something  mysterious, merely because it is mysterious.  But how humiliating lo human pride, to know that ihe  most splendid acquirements, made by the most towering groins, have only been able lo ascertain, in part, a few of the operations carried on in the universe I When we attempt to pry  into the causi s of the order and operations oi nature, we perceive, beyond what at first appeared causes, still other causes—  mystery upon mystery, extending in endless susscession, lar  beyond the reach of our limited faculties. In the search  man's strongest intellect might advance, were it possible, with  unabated ardour, through all lime, and slill not have entored  tlie vestibule of Ihe great temple of absolute knowledge. Hovr  humiliating to our self pride, to know, that o( us, who probably boast of our knowledge of sciences, of arts, or of a few of  ihe languages of this babbling earth, not one in a thousand  shall ever attain that exalted stand, which hut few have attained, to know how ignorant we are, and how unbounded is the  held of science beyond our reach.  The most perfect knowledge wo possess of any science, pertaining to thonatural world, is but superficial and imperfect at  best: we only perceive tho plainer ' its, and the coarser processes, while the more subtile, tho more intimate, escape our  few and imperfect senses, just as air eludes our vision.

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL  coarser objects, such as men, animals, trees, cities, mountain:  and rivers, while we perceive not the. thousand kinds of lift  and motion, the worlds in miniature, which are concealed in  our shallow and hurried into unnoted ruin, by every step W(  take,  "Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas," has alway.'  been a sentiment of human nature, and will he no less so it  time to come, The causes of those facts and phenoment  which we do know are beyond our reach, and probably bo  yond our comprehension. When ono supposed cause lint  been traced up, it terminates in other causes still more mysteri  ous; and those again in others until the mind becomes hewil  tiered in thi chase. Wo can at most discover only a succession of events, and the order in which they occur without  knowing why it is so.—Who can tell what impulse is ; how  it is communicated; what peculiar property is superadded?—  When one body receives a blow—how is it that the body  which strikes loses motion, and Ihe one stricken takes on mo  tion? what invisible change has been effected in the particles  of each by their approximation ? As it is only by the perceptions of our minds that we can know any thing of mutter or  spirit, it liillnu s that we can know only such things as are capable of making an impression upon our minds: those objects  which have mi properties, that will answer tt one ofourfivi  sensesmusl pass hj entirely unknown, as if they had no exis  icnc". i lad we as many years of life, anil as many senses as  Vol, tire gives to tho inhabitants of Saturn, or seventy two,as  distinct ns our presi nl live, with a life of fifteen thousand years,  we mi lit n netrnte intothemysteriesoflho universe;—or had  we tin- number of senses he allows to the inhabitants of those  plan '(•.- which revolve around the I), g-stnr as tin ir sun Bnd  cn'.r", thai is u arly one thousand, with a lili- seven hundred,  times longer than those of Saturn, we too might find in matter  that "three hui Ired" essential properties did nol hill'fill up  the catalogue, which now, to our five --uses, is restricted to five  or six.

The five filaments of nerves have been  traced from their origins to their extreme tissues, and their  control over voluntary and functional motion has hem deter-  mined:the arteries mid veins have been traced to their ultimate  inosculations; their morbidand healthy actions defined: in short,  'he whole structure and functions so completely understood  that it has been supposed by some thatanntomy, if not physiology, might be ranked among the exact sciences,  But we cannot i nter into the mysteries of life: Who conli  tell in what it consists? how vitality is connected with tho body ...  ami how leparated ? Howdoes life, which is diffused through- I  out the whole body, become extinct when a single member is  injured ? or what sustains the powerful and incessant action of)tl  that force-pump, the heart, for three score years and ten? or  i,|why does any muscle contract at all? What minute change  takes place in the ultimate fibres when health ceases and be-  fore disease begins?—These with thousandsof other phenomena  are beyond our search.  Vision is the result of reflected and refracted light upon tin-  retina of the eye, where the images of external objects are  painted inverted ; and, when objects are distant or numerous, the inverted images in the eye are so small,  as scarcely to occupy a point to each. Still we see objects as  large, and at their proper distances, from the. mountain down  to the atom. We know the theory of vision as taught by our  most enlightened philosophers ; but can any one explain what  is tho essential nature of light; how and why it exists? why  certain objects refract it—why others reflect it; and why others  absorb it, and it is forever gone; why another body generates  and throws it off?—why does it pass through the impervious  chrystal, and not through a piece of porous black paper?—Or  how is it that certain particles of light, refracted and impinged  upon the retina in points not the hundredth part of an inch in  haunter, should represent to our minds, bodies, one hundred,  and even ten thousand times larger than our whole bodies, of  which the eye is a small portion? or how do we see objects remote to any distance, even to a fixed star, when the only change  to us is a few rays in the interior of the eye ?  Hearing, we believe, is simply certain vibrations produced  on the tympanum of the ear by peculiar kinds of undulations  in tlie external air. From ihe varied nature of these proceed  all tin- phenomena of sound nnd healing We hear sounds  nt a distance, notwithstanding tho vibrations of the tympanum  air effi eti tl immediately by the air in the external ear. We  can tell the direction whence sound comes, and yet the undulations of air, from all points', must enter the cur at the soma  place: how is it, that certain sensations follow certain vibrations of the tympanum? of joy, melancholy, fear, admiration, or courage? none of ns can tell.  The mind is essential to nil sensations, as well as to all the  operntionsof reasoning. Yetof its nature we know nothing.  ixcept by certain operations attributed to it. Independent of  ilir sensations, which are altered stales of mind, operating  hrough matter, we know nothing of its essential qualities.  Philosophers have speculated and written much respecting  its various operations, and upon its nature and i ssentinl qualities: hut can tho most proficient in tho science of mind, tell  us //«,-'• ntiiitl ami matter an- so mysteriously united? or what  are the properties of the mind indi pendi ntlyof the body &gt; f&gt;i  can any ono i xplain what changes take place in the ultimate  fibres by their contact with mind?

But does he comprehend all the principles, all the laws regulating the heavenly  bodies? does he comprehend the nature of that great power that  moves and sustains them in their relative positions? can he  tell the origin and nature of that universal principle, gravitation ? can ho tell us why the fixed stars twinkle with a more  brilliant light than the planets?  With all the advances made in modern astronomy, there  still remains as much ignorance of the cause of many important facts, as there was four thousand years ago: but there  is increased reason for admiration and overwhelming astonishment, at the wisdom and power that has created and sustain  ed those orbs in boundless space.  What becomes of a star when il suddenly and forever dis  appears? Tycho Brahe informs us of one, which appeared  very brilliant for months together, and suddenly disappeared  and has not been seen now for two hundred years: and Sir Isaac  Newton informs us of others. Werethey annihilated; or are  astronomers deceived in supposing the stars inhabited worlds?  With all the advances mid discoveries of modern times,  made in chemist ru, we know, comparatively, only a few facts,  which might be extended to an unlimited amount, had we  only six dozen senses, like the inhabitants of Saturn, instead  of our scanty five. With that number of senses, everybody  in nature, simple matter, air, lire, water, would multiply its  qualities and properties lo our observation in a geometrical  ratio. Chemical aflinities are mysteries lo the most profound  chemists; they know thai certain bodies have an attraction or  Indeed we know but little of that wonderful power which  pervades all nature, under its modified forms of Electricity,  Galvanism, and Magnetism;  That mighty power,  "That over-busy wheels the silcnl spheres ;  Works in the deep: shoots streaming thence,  The lair profusion thai o'ersprcads the spring:  Flings from the sun direct the naming day;  Feeds every creature; hurls the tempest forth;  And as on earth this grateful change revolves,  With transport touches nil ihe springs of life."  The discoveries in this branch of the sciences are among  the most wonderful that have yet been made by man; of a  power that admits of an endless variety of operation; whose  influence pervades every particle of matter; affecting all the  animt.1 and physical operations upon our globe; producing either directly, or indirectly, all the inexplicable phenomena of  nature. Recent discoveries have shown that the galvanic  fluid possesses powers, which, a few years since, were unknown; it bus been found capable of moving machinery equal  loa powerfulstcam engine; of lifting almost incredible weights;  and these properties have been discovered by only a change  in the arrangement of the plates in the battery. How many  other changes it is susceptible of, we know-not: could we know  all its relations, we might find it was the cause or active agent  of gravitation in all the planetary systems.— It may be under  the controlling power of God, the great Animus Mundi; that  operates as variedly as the matter through which it operates;  Atone time magnetism ; at another galvanism ; nnd at another electricity: at one  time attraction;   at another  reptil-  r. pulsion fir each other; but they cannot tell why one at- sion : at one time il rends the clouds with its thunder; and at  tracts, or another repels ; why tho union of two opposite substances should destroy each other and produce a third of a  different nature. Tiny cannot tell why lire will burn and  consume one gas, mid he extinguished in another; why it  should have no power on one body, and in another produce  the most tremi ndous explosion. When we leave the contracted laboratory of man, and descend into the great Offlci-  num of nature, mysteries thicken around, until, bewildered, we  are lost in amazement. Examine the spars, and stalactites in  caves, near the surface of the earth; who can tell how they  are formed; how the particles of which they nre composed,  are held in solution in a transparent fluid, nnd deposited in  the form of the hardest rock: how nature generates all her  store of minerals, gases, and mineral compounds; how she  provides her combustible slons, and kindles up all her fires;  how siie prepares tier volcanoes, ami generates her floods of  lava, which bury cities and countries in ruin; or how she  agitates the confined gases, which make tho tottering earth  reel to an 1 fro like a drunken man?  Can wo t.-ll the s icret causa of gravitation, as connected  with our pi,nut? I low does il operate at the immense distance  of the earth from the sun? And what is the vast projectile  force which puts ,!i • earth in motion? Should future experiments and discoveries satisfy us that it is a modified slate of  (lie galvanic fluid, wc shall still be as far from its solution as  ever: we cannot tell how this power is generated, why and  another rends the earth with its bolts; at one time it regulates  the small operations of man's little battery, and at another it  holds Ihe planets in their orbits, and wheels them silently  around their centres.  When we look into the component parts of the earth, what  is llieamount of our knowledge there?    We can trace a k'vr  strata near the surface; we can name them, and record the order in which they appear; we can turn many of them to our  use; but what do we know of the interior  of the   earth;  what do we   know   of  nature's  uses    for   all the   strata  known to us, as well as those that are beyond our research?  Can we suppose they are solely for man's use, when the great  portion of it has been hidden from his research for thousands  of years before man's creation, as well as since?    Have the  tgnectic effluvia been coursing tho earth for thousands of  years only lo hold here anil (here a mariner's or surveyor's  needle; and still not he discovered  by man until  the human  family had almost approached their dotage?    Do the numerous strata of earths and rocks, and the alternate -reins of metals; silver, gold, iron, copper, &c. perform no agency in the  plan of creation, except now and then to reward the toil of the  miner?    Is all the vast interior of the earth, with its numerous strata, to a depth of four thousand miles in every direction, created only to sustain the slender shell for man to  tread upon?    No, nothing is made in vain:—and may we not  reasonably infer that they perform some important office in  how it operates;  we can only know that such  are its opera- the great economy of the world?    May not they, as a whole,  lions—and no more.

If ihe puny pile of concentric plates, which one  man can erect and move at pleasure, can produce an invisible power sufficient lo lift many thousands of pounds, or equal  ti, a steam engine, how amply provided is the earth's great  laboratory for performing all the operations and movements  requiring this agency ?  All human philosophy is subject to continual change: tho  last theories und discoveries are generally considered true, or  more correct titan tho former, which ore abandoned as exploded errors: notwithstanding men are not now probably as far  from absolute truth, as they were six thousand years ago. To  the most perfi-ct approaches to absolute truth there will always be some obstacle, or some apparent error to confute, ow.  ing to the limited nature of our senses ; and theories may appear to us perfect, which new light will show to he absurd:  undone theory ait ir another will In-exploded, as long us man  shall he a reasoning being.

Tho magnificent Meteoric Shower of  1833, is too well known to require the recital of any particulars. (Jf the recurrence of the phenomenon at the corresponding period in 1834, and in 1835, evidence has been  presented to the public in previous numbers of this Journal.  " I now feel authorized to assert, that the Meteoric Shower  it-appeared on the morning of the 13,/j November, 1S30.  " It has been supposed by some, that tho appearance of an  extraordinary number of shooting stars, at tho several anniversaries since the great phenomenon of November, 1833,  i  ' Amer.

Having, however, been  much in the habit of observing phenomena of this kind,]  can truly say, that those exhibitions of shooting stars which  have for several years occurred on the 13th or 14th of November, are characterized by several peculiarities which  clearly distinguish them from ordinary shooting stars. Such  peculiarities are the following.  I. The number of meteors, though exceedingly variable,  is much greater than usual, especially of the larger and  brighter kinds.  U. An uncommonly large proportion leave luminous  trains.  :!. Tho meteors, with few exceptions, all appear to proceed from a common centre, the position of which lias been  uniformly in nearly the same point in the heavens, viz. in  some part of the constellation Leo.  -1. 'l'he principal exhibition lias at all times, nnd at all places, occurred between midnight and sunrise, and the maximum from three, to [our o'clock.  " In all these particulars, the Meteoric Showers of 1834, 5.  and li, have resembled that of 1833; while no person, so far  as I have heard, has observed the same combination of circumstances on any other occasion within the same period.—  I have not supposed il necessary, in order to establish Ihe  identity of these later meteoric showers with that of 1833,  that tiny should he of the same magnitude with that. A  small eclipse I have considered a phenomenon of the same  kind with a large one; and conformably to this analogy, I  have regarded an eclipse of the sun, first exhibiting itself as  a slight indentation of the solar limb, but increasing in magnitude at every recurrence, until it becomes total, and afterwards, at each return, but partially covering the solar disk.  until the moon passes quite clear of the sun,—as affording  no bad illustration of what probably takes place in regard to  these meteoric showers. The fiict that the Aurora Borealis  appears unusually frequent and magnificent for a few successive years, and then for a long time is scarcely seen at all, was  proved by Mairan, a hundred years ago.** There is much  reason to suspect a like periodical character in tie- phenomenon in question, which first arrested attention in 1831, became  mine remarkable in 1832, arrived at its maximum in 1833,  and has since grown less and less at each annual'return.—  Some seem to suppose that we are now wan-anted in expecting  a similar exhibition of meteors on the morning of every future  anniversary; hut this, I think, is not to he expected. It is  perhaps more probable, that its recurrence, unless in a very  diminished degree, will scarcely be witnessed again by the  present generation. The shower, however, at its late return,  was more striking than I had anticipated; and it must be acknowledged to be adventurous, to enter the region of prediction respecting the future exhibitions of a phenomenon, both  whoso origin and whose laws we so imperfectly understand."

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  ,hat an extraordinary display of meteors did occur on the night  of the 12th and 13th of November, 1830; and that similar  showers have been witnessed on each anniversary since the  magnificent display, Nov. 1833.]  " From the foregoing accounts compared, we arc led to conclude that tho meteoric shower increased in intensity from  north to south, that of South Carolina having been the most  considerable of all, so far as  accounts have reached us.  " I lues not the recurrence of (his phenomenon for six sue  eessive years at the same period of Ihe year, plainly show its  connexion with the progress of tho earth in its orbit ? and does  not the fact that the greatest display occurs every where in  places diflering widely in longitude, at the same hour of the  day, as plainly indicate its connexion with the motion of the  earth on its axis? Tho supposition of a body in a space  consisting ofan immense collection of meteors, stretching across  the earth's orbit obliquely, so that the earth passes under it in  its annual progress, while places on its surface lying westward  of each other are successively brought by the diurnal revolution to the point of nearest approach, will satisfy both these  conditions. I can think of no other that will. The "point  of nearest approach" may be merely the extremity, or the  skirl of the nebulous body, while the greatest part of it, and  consequently its centre of gravity, lies Ico distant from the  earth to be much influenced by its gravity. It would not be  at all inconsistent with the known extent of astronomical  hodiis, to give to the body in question a breadth of thousands  and a length of millions of mile's.  " 11 was an accidental observation, made after the conclusion was formed, which ascribes the origin of the meteoric  showers to a revolving nebulous hotly, that first led me to  suspect the Zodiacal high! to be the body in question.—  This, according to La Place, is such a nebulous body, revolving around the sun in the plane of the solar equator.* Wo  actually observe it to reach over the orbit of the earth, making  an angle with its plane of only 7 1-1 degrei s. It is not difficult to place it in such a situation that the earth shall come  very near to the skirls of it at least. We should, indeed, expect this meeting of tho two bodies lo take place at the nodes  of the solar equator, and therefore in December anil Jiint  instead of November and April. It is easily conceivable,  however, that the aphelion of the Zodiacal Light, at which  place it approaches nearest to the earth, does not lie exactly  at the node, but so far from it that the earth passes it a month  before it comes to its node, at which time, moreover; the earth  is mure than a million of miles nearer to tho sun than its  mean distance. In endeavoring to fix the periodic time of  the meteoric body, since it must be either a year or half a  year, (for no other periodic times could bring the two bodies  together at intervals of a year.t) several considerations induced the belief, that half a year was the true period—an  an inference drawn especially from the apparent great excess  of velocity of the earth at the point of concourse; but the  period of a year, (or more probably, a little less than a year,)  by implying that (he two bodies are always comparatively  • M,-,-.

Vol, XXVI. p. lew, of tlii.-t Journal,  near to each other, would better explain the occurrence of  shooting stars at all seasons of the year, and would be particularly favorable to the explanation of those meteoric showers which have on two occasions, at least, j occurred near the  last of April,—a time distant about half a year from November, and therefore sustaining a like relation to the opposite  point of its orbit. In such a case, meteoric showers would  occur in April and November, for the same reason that the  Transits of Mercury take place in May and November exclusively. The grenter frequency of meteors in November than  in April, naturally results from the greater proximity of the  earth to the sun at the former than at the latter period; to  which, perhaps, may be added, the effect of the eccentricity of  the orbit of the meteoric body, the aphelion being on the side  of November. In the present state of our knowledge on this  subject, 1 regard it as a point open for inquiry, whether it will  best accord with the phenomena of shooting stars, to give to  (lie meteoric bodya period of nearly one year, or of half a year.  I have been somewhat disappointed, that astronomers should  have paid so little attention to the remarkable changes which  take place in the Zodiacal light, about the 13th of November, as has been repeatedly mentioned in ibis Journal. It  ippoars to me a fact deserving their attention, that the Zodiacal light, which for weeks before the 13th of November, appears in the morning sky, with a western elongation of from  00 to 90 degrees from the sun, (while up to that time not a  limpseof it can bo caught in the evening sky,) should immediately afterwards appear after the evening twilight in the  west, and rapidly rise through the constellations C'apricornus  and Aquarius, to an elongation of more than 00 degrees  astward of the sun, while it as rapidly withdraws itself from  the morning sky, and within a few days vanishes entirely from  the western side of the sun. For three years past I have  observed these changes with much interest, and feel warrant) il  in asserting, that they have been repeated with uniform regularity. The present year, the light was very feeble in the  morning sky, an effect partly owing to the presence and peculiar splendor of the planet Venus; hut as soon after the 13th  of November as the absence of the moon would permit observations, the light appeared in the west immediately alter  tyillght, crossing the Milky Way, and rising in a pyramid  almost as bright as that, the triangular space between it and  the Galaxy, embracing the Dolphin, appearing, by contrast,  strikingly darker.  I can account for this great and rapid change of place in  the Zodiacal Light, a change which is unlike any it sustains  at any other period of the year, only by supposing, that on or  lbout tho 13th of November, it comes very near to us, and  that we pass rapidly by it, thus giving it a great parallactic  motion, an effect which is in perfect accordance with all our  previous conclusions.  According to this view of the subject, the Zodiacal light  would no longer be regarded as. a portion of the sun's atmosphere, but as a nebulous or comrjary body, revolving arounil  : In Virginia, tin.I various othor purls of tin- llnitfil Slates, In 1803, anil in Prance  t looo,   Malum,' suitable allowances for i]\t- more rapiil progross of tint eartli  through the winter signs, ami fin- the change of style, ami the nfeteorleshower el  26lhofAprll,^095, occurred at very nearly the opposite point of tho earth's orlili  Vol,.

Wedislike all theories; and most of all do we dislike them  in the exact sciences. Their day has gone by; and happy in  deed it is for the cause of science, that they begin to be re  jected in every system of physics. If we yield to fancy a single  pug,-,: in Astronomy, that sttblimest of all the matin  malic sciences, we may with equal propriety and with little  ililficuhj-, sllow her lo account for every unsolved phenomenon.  If I apprehend the above essay correctly, Mr. Olmsted has  fallen into several errors, in regard to the Zodiacal Light,  La 1 'I - :■ long since demonstrated that the identity of the solar at,in,sphere and the Zodiacal light is impossible, and yet  the writer above, announces to us in italics, as if the idea were  •lew, that "According to this view of the subject, Ihe Zodiacal  li'^bl would no longer lie regarded as a portion of the Sun's  atmosphere," ey-c. 1 was not aware that it had recently been  so regarded. I In the contrary, the reasoning of La Place is  clear. First, the solar atmosphere cannot reach beyond the  •ubit of the nearest planet; otherwise, friction would retard,  nnd finally overcome its centrifugal motion, and it would be  ttUractcd into the body of the Sun. It, therefore, does not  reach tho orbit of Mercury, Secondly, the ratio of the lessto  ihe greater diameter of tho solar atmosphere, cannot bo greater  than that of 2-3 lo I.  Now both or either of these reasons is sufficient to refute the  i lenlity; for it is certain that the Zodiacal light passes over the  orbits of several plaints, reaching far beyond the path of our  own: yel they suffer no retardation from its presence: and its  form is thai of a very flat lens, such as the atmosphere never  could assume. After the demonstration of La Place, I am  curiousto know if any one maintained the identity of the sola,- atmosphere and the Zodiacal light.  An idea occurs to me, which may rather favor -Air. Olm-  sinks theory; but as truth is my object, rather than the refutation ol a theory which may become philosophy, I shall stl'g-  jjosl it. I SUspecl that the revolution of the Zodiacal Light,  caused by the sun's rotatory motion on his axis, is not tenable  First, 1» cause the supposition that il is a material fluid is inconsistent with that of its contact with the sun, as the solar  atmosphere occupies the space in the vicinity of his surface-  secondly, to admit of its contact with the sun requires the hypo-  tie sis, that it resembles light, or is one of that class of fluids  whose materiality is questionable;*  I upon this supposition, it would not be affected by the sun's revolution.  Mr. 0. seems surprised that Astronomers should have paid  so little attention to the changes which occur in the Zodiacal  Light about ihe time of the meteoric display. This nc&lt;'le-ct,  perhaps, has aristn from the fiict that such changes have not  every whero been found ,o occur.    And in this place we  ' Tiiit- Is necessary i» ad  adma of its free passage through ilic suicr atmosphere,  assuming all ihe varieties of hues, which characterize our  magnificent sunsets. For nearly a year past 1 have been  carefully watching their features and noting the dales of their  occurrence: and so far from appearing splendid in the morning sky with a westward elongation, a few weeks or days before Nov. 13lh, I have never been able to detect the leasl exhibition of it in the morning sky. For the past six weeks, I  have been more than usually on the alert, but with the same  results. On the contrary, the whole year, with very short  intervals, has furnished them in the west, and most spli ndid,  when according to Mr. O's theory, they should be most distant and flint.  During the month of April, when one of the periodic returns of this 'Nebulous comet' should occur, the weather  was quite as favorable for tho appearance of the Zodiacal  Light as usual, yet, I have none noted in that month either  fir evening or morning. In July, on the contrary, we had  very brilliant ones, though less splendid and more rare than  in August. This month was peculiarly prolific in displays  both of the Light in question and of shooting slars; bill neither was confined to any particular portion of the month.—  The finest displays of the kilter were on the 5th and lGth.—  This, il will be recollected, was just at ihe time when the cornet  of Mr. O. was in its apogee, supposing its period semi-annual.  1 In the (ith, 7th and 8th of the present month, when, cf course,  we should expect the light in the east, and westward of the  sun, according to (ho theory, they did not appear in the  morning, bill in the. evening, with their usual brilliancy.—  From the 8th to the 10th there were no exhibitions of ihe  Zodiacal light; but on the 10th, 22d and 23d they were very  fine, without any thing unusual in their appearance.  The evenings of Ihe lOtll nnd 11th were very favorable  for observation, and I kept a look out late and early, but saw  no unusual meteors. The night of the 12th clouded at 11.  and prevented further observation : but up to that time it was  very clear, and the number of meteors was unusually small.  I saw two,viz:—The first about the magnitude of Polaris,  was first seen near Aldebaran, in the constellation Taurus,  and passed south about 10 deg., and disappeared. The second from Gamma Cassioprede, and travelled north, it was  -mall, mid visible but a moment. Neither, it is obvious, had  my connection with the annual shower. 1 regretted much  that my observation could not last all night, as I had awaited  the result with much anxiety.—The night of the 13th was  very clear, but presented nothing unusual, with the exception  of a single meteor at day break of the 14th. I copy from  my journal of the 14th—" At half past 0 A. M. witnessed a  magnificent meteor, which startled me from the composure  with which I was surveying the brilliant morning stars. It  originated near Aldebaran—a little above, and passed towards  the horizon, inclining North slightly.

II  remaining visible some, seconds after tho body's disappearance,  The tail was the full length of tho meteor's visible flight,  which was about 12 dog. Its color was nearly white, inclining to red, and its light vory intense.  On the night of the 14th, there appeared a most brilliant  and singular phenomenon; probably, a modification of the  Aurora Borealis, (a rare exhibition in ibis latitude.) Il was  in the form of an arc, ono extremity of which reached the  horizon some loto 20 (leg. west of North, and the other directly under Capella, and a little farther east. It reached as  lu'ah as Polaris. Its extremities were much the most brilliant,  being of a bright red or crimson color, and the arc grew  fainter higher up. It was visible 30 to 3.3 minutes, and then  vanished entirely. The same was visible in a small degree  N. E. on the evening of the loth.  I am inclined, from these last facts, to believe, that they  bad some connection with the annual exhibition, nnd that a  clear morning on the 13th might have presented a "shower  of meteors."  (Since the above was banded in for publication, I have witnessed a display of meteors, with an obvious radiant: and  think it important that a notice of the same be annexed. I  hasten to give you the following extract from my diary of  tho 25th hist.]  " From 0 to 7 P. M. found several warm streaks of irre  spirablo air,—slight breeze from S., quite sensible to the ol  factories. During tho evening, to half past 1(1, witnessed an  unusual number of meteors, all radiating from a point in the  constellation Perseus, very near the intersection of a line  drawn from tho Pleiades lo Capella, with that joining Zrta  in the right foot of Perseus with tho left foot of Auriga.—  Two of the meteors were very large,—one most magnificent.  The letter was a point when first seen, ami darted with the  velocity of lightning, increasing in magnitude as its velocity  (I. creased. Its tail was 20 (leg. or morn in length,—nebulous, and vanished very fast. Not so the body:—it grew  larger till it reached Leo, when it appeared about 10 mill, in  diameter; and about 2 (leg. N. E. of Regains, it dropped into  three or four intensely brilliant blazes, each larger than  the body, nnd of equal intensity,—resembling much the  trembling blazes from an exploded rocket. Tho velocity  of tho meteor seemed entirely destroyed by ihe resistance of  the air, anil its falling to pieces, not to be the result of  explosion. 1 am thus particular in my description, that  others who may have witnessed it, may have data upon  which to estimate its altitude at dissolution. This and the  other large one with a tail, were two of live, which were  seen in a few minutes—say 8 or 10,—had not a watch at  hand, and was compelled to estimate time.  Hy tracing back the line of the meteors, noticed above as  occurring, about the meteoric anniversary, it will be found  that they all intersect very near the point of the above radiant; and I hereby invite information from all observers by  whom this article may bo read, whether facts may or may  not corroboroto the suggestion, that the radiant of the annual  display—if any there have really been in 1837,—has shifted  its position from Leo  It will bo homo in mind, that all these remarks are presented, not to refute or establish any thing; but as facts, to pass  to philosophers lor whatever they may be worth.

[Professor Olmsted, on the 13th of last month, witnessed a  splendid return of tho Meteoric Shower—a full account of  which wo shall give in our next.—Ed.]  John Quincy Adams.—The October number of the  " Democratic Review," published at Washington, contains tho  following sketch of that extraordinary mail, John Qllincy  Adams:  " Our attention is now attracted to a ray of light located' on  the left of the House, in the neighborhood of the Speaker's  Chair. It proceeds from that wonderful man who in his person combines the agitator, poet, philosopher, statesman, critic  nnd orator—John (luincy Adams. There he sits, hour after  hour, day after day, with untiring patience, never absent from  his seat, never voting for on adjournment, vigilant as the most  zealous member of ihe House, his ear ever on ihe alert, always  prepared to go at once into the profoundest question of state.  or of ihe minutest points of order. We look at him and murk  his cold and tearful eye, his stern and abstracted gaze, and  conjure up phantoms of other scenes. We look upon a more  than King, who has filled every department of honor in his  native land, still at his post; he was the president of millions,  now the representative of forty odd thousand, quarrelling  about trifles or advocating high principles;—to-day, growling  and sneering at the House with an abolition petition in his  trembling hand; and, anon, lording it over the passions, and  lashing tho members into the wildest state of enthusiasm by his  indignant and emphatic eloquence. Alone, unspoken to, un-  consulted with by others, he sits apart, wrapped in his reveries,  or probably he is writing, his almost perpetual employment.  He looks enfeebled, but yet he is never tired; worn out, but  ever ready for the combat; melancholy, but let a willy thing  fill from any member, and that old man's face is wreathed in  smiles. He appears passive, but wo to the unfortunate member that hazards an arrow at him—the eagle is not swifter in  its flight than .Mr. Adams; with his agitated finger quivering  in sarcastic gesticulation, he seizes upon his foe, and, amid  the amazement of the House, he seldom fails to take a signal  vengeance. His stores of knowledge on every subject, garnered up in the course of his extraordinary life, in the well arranged store house of a memory which is said never to have  permitted a single fact to escape it, give him a great advantage  overall comers in encounters of this kind.

A. Van Hoesen, Natchez.  Communications for insertion in tho Journal, which do not  contain remittances or the names of Subscribers, should, to  ensure attention, be postpaid.

Ill consequence of ihe almost entire prostration of all kinds  of business in the city of Natchez, during tho prevalence of  tho dreadful opidemic, the Executive Committee of the Jefferson College and Washington Lyceum were not able to  red ■•■in ihe promisoof the appearance of the South-Western  Journal in the months of October and November. Wo feel  confident that a generous community will appreciate tho apology, which, under such circumstances, we now make with  the full hope of a favorable response, and an entire acquittal,  in the public mind, of any dereliction of duty on the part of  thosegentleincn ostensibly pledged to the fulfilment of this trust,  We now present, to the attention and patronage of the en  lightened community of the South-West, a JOURNAL, to  be devoted to the scientific and literary interests of the Southern section of the great vale of the Mississippi. We ask  the aid of the learned, the accomplished and the patriotic, in  making our enterprise an honor to the literary character of  ihe citizens and ihe institutions of Mississippi, Occupyinga  department, which is, at present, filled by no kindred journal  in the South West, and emulous to represent an interest entirely separate from, and superior to, the commercial ami political movements ofthe times,—we shall truly need the fostering attention and the substantial patronage ol'all the friends  of learning, education and intellectual improvement, lo sustain our infant enterprize, and to shape it to a happy accordance with the taste and genius of a chivalrous and accomplished community.  To justify the reasonable expectations of thepublic, we have  it in our power to pledge the mental resources and the industry of an association of literary and scientific gentlemen, whose-  best powers will be expended in the effort to advance the  cause of improvement, and worthily lo represent the intellectual taste ofthe Southwest. In an enterprise so arduous and  responsible, is il too much for us to solicit the patronage of tin-  public at large—our personal friends—and to invoke the aid  of genius and of liberality lo cheer the commencement of our  labors, that the seed may be sown in hope and the harvest  gathered with satisfaction and profit ?  In presenting this first number ofthe South Western Journal to the public, justice to ourselves compels us to say that it  has been prepared for the press under rather unpropitious circumstances, and will serve rather as a specimen of the materiel  and design of our publication, than ns a measure ofthe spirit  and devoledness, which, wo hope, will enrich succeeding  numbers.  The " esprit elu corps, or, rather, the full scope and intent of  any journal, is rarely entered into and attained in the commencement. To shape and fashion, after a high intellectual  pattern ; to embody the ideal image and purpose ofthe mind;  to bring out the fitting proportions and nice adjustments which  should ever belong lo the creations of the intellect,—must, of  necessity, be the result of time, reflection, experie'iice1, and the  sanctions of public approbation.  With these reflections wc submit this, the commencement  of our Journal, to the notice ofthe friends of science and letters in the Southwest—not doubting hut a generous patronage  will defray the expenses of the publication—the only pecuniary boon which is sought—wjiile all the reward we seek is  the mutually delightful intercourse which may be opened,  by our enterprise, of mind with mind; of ihe readers with the  writers; of both with those intellectual pleasures that strengthen with acquaintance and mature with time. ,  The Monthly meeting of the Lyceum.—The last  meeting of the Jefferson College and Washington Lyceum  was attended in the College Hall on Saturday, November 2d.  J. S. B. Thacher, Esq. of Natchez, read a Lecture on ihe  "Philosophy of tho Law" and Professor (.'. G. Forshey  read a paper on "Meteoric Showers," which appears in this  number ofthe Journal.  The exercises at the next meeting, on the first Saturday in  January, will be a Lecture by Mr. G. V. H. Forbes, and  Essays by Messrs. Dr. J. W. Monette and Judge Jennings.  Lyceum in England.—An intelligent correspondent of  the Philadelphia National Gazette has found a Lyceum in  Bungay, Suffolk county, England—the first and only one  over established in our mother isle. The writer thus playfully  announces his discovery:— «  " But what is more amazing, they have fbimetl here a bona  tide New England Lyceum /—the first that I have heard of  in this country; and what is more to the purpose, though but  a year old, it is flourishing, and full of hope.

Farewell, then, to the author ofthe  " Lights and Shadows of Scottish life!" farewell to the racy  periotls of that flowing and eloquent pen ! The mind that  pit-sided in the temple has departed. The flame of intellect  has flickered from the urn—mid now all is darkness.  COLLEGES IN THE UNITED STATES.  There are at present ninety-five College's in the United  Sia! 'S, divided rather unequally among the several States.  We have not the names of all theso institutions before us—nor  is i material, we suspect, in regard to many of them, whether  tin y have any namoor not. A good College will he known  by its reputation; and tho moonshine institutions, or modorn  patent machines for turning out unkempt leather heads upon  the world, should be forever anomalous.  The following list shews the number of Colleges in each  slate:—  Maine, 2; New Hampshire, 1; Vermont, 3; Massachusetts, 3; Rhode Island, 1; Connecticut, 3; New York, G;  New Jersey, 2; Pennsylvania, If); Delaware, 1; Maryland,  I. District of Columbia, 2; Virginia, 5; North Carolina, 1;  South Carolina, 2; Georgia, 1; Alabama, 3; Mississippi,  3; Louisiana, 3; Tennessee, 5; Kentucky, 7; Ohio, 11  Indiana, 3; Illinois, 5; Missouri, 0; Michigan, 2.  In noticing the distribution of these institutions in tho differ  en; States, the fact can scarcely escape observation that the  older and better educated Stales have the fewer Colleges  they may have the better ones. Used as mediums of elevating and improving the minds of a recent population, the Colleges of some of the now states may have their value equal to  that of indiflcrent grammar schools; but it would be better if  their titles bore some relation to their literary standing. A  pompous, titled, but unendowed and obscure institution burlesques Ihe time-honored name of College, and disrobes it of  its classic and moral associations. It is the harlequin aping  the celebrated actor, and earning a laugh at the expense of  merit and genius.  We are friendly to well endowed and firmly established  Colleges in the different sections of the United State's; but, by  the foregoing list, it would seem that some single States have  nominal Colleges enough to supply (if they were good for  any thing) half the territory ofthe Union.  Giuaro Colleoe.—'Phis edifice, sacred to the education  ofthe orphan, is rising in grandeur by the impulse of that  princely bequest which has immortalized the name of the  donor and will entail upon him the blessings of future generations. The exterior walls of the noble pile have risen to  their full height, and one of those marble pillars, six feet in  diameter at the base and sixty feet in height, which are to  surround the entire edifice, has been fitted to its place. The  interest of the immense bequest is only permitted to be expended in the building. From this cause, and from the  length oftime necessary to build permanently, the college will  not be finished in less than two years from this time. When  completed, one writer says, it will be a wilderness of marble.  Without doubt the structure will beggar the appearance ofthe  be'st college edifices in America, and compete with, if not excel, the proudest halls of instruction in the old world.  Mr. Cache, the President elect of Girard college, is now  travelling in Europe, preparatory to bis labors over these  halls sacred to charity and learning.  Tin: Annular Eclipse ok the Sun in 1838—This  remarkable eclipse will occur on the 18th of September next,  and will present tho annulus, or luminous ring, to all those inhabitants ofthe United States between whom and the Sun's  exact centre the moon shall pass. The eclipse will be annular over a space 42(1 miles wide. Tho annular path will approach the United States from the Northwest through Luke  Superior, Wisconsin Territory, Michigan, Lake Erie, the  Northeast part of Ohio, the Southeastern part of Pennsylvania, ihe Western part, of Maryland, Northern part of Vir-  inia. Southern pari of Maryland, Eastern shore of Virginia,  nd thence Southeasterly into the Atlantic Ocean. It will  occur between 3 and 0 I*. M., and will present nothing more  than a partial eclipse of the Sun to those living on either side  of the pre scribed path across the territory of the United Stales,  -120 miles in width.

Let naught ofthe hollow world be seen  Where my bleaching bones shall be -,  But lay me down in the silver stream  Ofthe murmuring summer sea.  There's nunc that will drop a friendly tear  When the exile's race is run—  Nil hand will plant o'crmy lonely bier  The child of a summer sun.  The autumn strips the lolly tree,  But the spring returns again,  The dew descends on the pearly lea,  And refreshes the .sunburnt plain. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/374	374	375.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/375.jp2

Once this soft turf, this rivulet's sands,  Were trampled by a hurrying crowd,  And fiery hearts and armed hands  Encountered in the battle cloud.  Ah! never shall the land forget  How gushed the life-blood of her brave—  Gushed, warm with hope and valor yet,  Upon the soil they sought to save.  .N,,w all is calm and fresh and still,  Alone Ihe chirp of flitting bird,  And talk of children mi Ihe hill,  And bell of wandering klne, are heard.  Nn solemn host goes trailing by  The black-mouthed gnu and staggering wain;  Men start not at the battle-cry,  Oh, he it never heard again !  Soon rested those who fought—but Ihou,  Who mingles) in the harder strife  For truths which men receive not now,  Thy warfare only ends with lite.  A friendless warfare! lingering long  Tin,,ugh weary day and weary year;  A wild and many-weaponcd Ihrong  Hang on thy front and flank and rear  Vet nerve thy spirit to the proof,  Ami blench not at thy chosen lo,;  Thciiinid g I may stand aloof,  The -age may frown—yet faint thou not!  Nor heed the .-.hall loo surely casl,  Tli,, hissing, stingiug boll of scorn;  Fur with thy side shall dwell, ai last.  The victory of endurance born.  Truth crushed to earth, shall rise again i  The eternal years of Good arc her's;  Bu, Error, wounded, writhes with pain,  And dies among his worshippers.  Yes, though thou lie upon the dust,  When those who helped thee floe in fear,  Die full of hope and manly trust.  Like those who fcll in battle here.  Another hand thy sword shall wield.  Anolher hand the standard wave,  Till from the trumpet's mouth is pealed  The blast of triumph o'er thy grave.  ELOQ.UENCE AND PIETY.  The following gem is the closing part of an address by the  Rev. (Professor) Ware, jr., to the students of Harvard Col-  lege, on the last Sunday of the Academical year.  "We look on your departure, young friends, with affectionate and anxious interest. Never again shall we meet you in  all lliese sacred services. The lies which have bound us to.  fether so long, in the daily offerings to God and the weekly  sympathies ofthe Sabbath, are now to be severed, to be united  ngain, may we hope,—or must we fear?—in the perfect enjoyment of that eternal Sabbath, in which the toils of earth  are to be ended, and the perfected spirit to be blessed.  "Meantime, for you, nnd for m, the work of life goes on;  may it be our daily and uninterrupted growth in knowledge  and virtue, till wc reach the completeness of our moral and  spiritual being! We commend you to your labors and trials.  We pray for your success and your happiness. We charge  you to be faithful to your great trusts. Do not be satisfied  with the education you have received, nor live in the midst of  infinite knowledge ns if you had already attained. Do not  propose to yourselves any merely earthly object of pursuit,  as if anything mortal was worthy lo content tho immortal.  Live for usefulness and society. Society is crying out lor tin-  aid of perfectly developed men, for the service of men, well  proportioned and well principled. Answer its call. Uphold its institutions. Stand fast for its rights, Plead for its  laws. Arm yourselves stoutly against all tyranny of one or  of many, against life, or liberty, or right. Do something, do  all you can, to be true counsellors to that sovereign power,  public opinion, and to save the land from being ruined by ihe  vice of the ignorant, or the knavery of the knowing. Wherever you go, carry the upright front of the true scholar, the  frankness and fairness of the true philosopher, tho boldness  nnd meekness of the holy apostle1, the self-sacrificing devotion of the sainted martyr. Then you shall be the terror of  the ill-doing, and stay, for a time at least, the perils of the  people.  "Last of all, and above all, consecrate yourselves to Cod;  you are not your own; you have no strength of yourselves:  consecrate yourselves to God. Worlc for him. Ally your,  selves to his counsels and his purposes, and secure the co-operation of his will.—In the deep life of the spirit commune  with him and thus nourish yourselves in all goodness. In  the affectionato imitation of Jesus Christ, commend yourselves to his blessing, and so find strength and peace. In the  hope and prospect of eternity, toil on. rejoicing and persevering, through good and evil report, knowing that your witness is in Heaven, your record on high. And then, when the  lay ol life shall be done, its discipline censed, its preparation  ended, then may your ripened spirits pass to the final award  of the good and faithful; then may you find, one ami all, that  you have indeed attained, are at length perfect, nnd among  the glorified immortals of Heaven, are partakers of the prize  of the high calling in Christ Jesus.  " We part from you at the altar here, let us meet you at the  throne hereafter." 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/375	375	376.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/376.jp2

SOU TII -WES T E R N J 0 U R N A L.  15  | The following is a fair specimen of German ideality—  though we have seen a more glowing and faithful transla  tion of thesamedream.— Ed. S, W. Jour.]  Translated fur theX. V. Mirror.  A DREAM.  "The intent of this fiction," says a German author, "will  excuse its boldness. If my heart was ever so unfortunate,  so withered, as that all the sentiments which affirm the existence of God were there destroyed, I would rend again these  pages; I would be staggered by them, and I would regain  mvsalva.ion and my faith. Some men deny tho existence of  God with as much indifference as others admit it; and there  are some who have believed it twenty years, nnd who ha  not encountered, till their twenty-first, the solemn moment,  when they have discovered, with ravishment, the rich appanage ofthis belief the vivifying warmth ofthis fountain of joy.  Payle has said in his dictionary, that atheism does not aflbrd  a refuge from the fear of eternal sufferings, The following  dream maybe considered ns this thought put in action.  "When, in infancy, they tell us that toward midnight, at  the hour when sleep presses most heavily on the soul, dreams,  become more sinister, the dead arise, and, in solitary churches,  imitate the pious services of ihe living, death frightens us on  account of the dead. When obscurity approaches, wo turn  away our thoughts from the church and its dark windows:  tho terrors of infancy, far more than its pleasures, resume  their wings to flutter around us, during the night of the drowsy soul. Ah! extinguish not those sparks; leave us our  dreams, even tho most sombre! They nre far more sweet  than our actual existence; they lead us back to that age when  the river of life reflected heaven.  " One summer evening, I was lying on the side of a hill:  I fell asleep and dreamed that I awoke, in the middle of the  night, in a cemetery.    The clock struck eleven.    The tombs  were all opened, and the iron gales of the church, agitated  by an invisible bund, opened and closed with a loud noise.   1  saw on the walls flitting shadows, and these were not projected by bodies : other livid shapes rose in the air, and only  the  inliuils reposed in their graves.    There was in the heavens a grayish cloud, thick, heavy, and which a gigantic  phantom compressed into long folds.   Above ine, 1 heard the  distant fall of avalanches, and under my feet ihe first commotion of a vast earthquake   All the church trembled, and the  air was shaken by harsh, discordant sounds.   Pale lightnings  gleamed through the darkness.    I was impelled, by very tor  ror, to seek refuge in the temple : two glaring basilisk's wen  placed before iis awful doors.    I advanced to the throng of  unknown shapes, on whom the seal of ancient ages was impressed.   All these pressed around the simple altar; their  breathing was agitated and  their breasts heaved with violence.    One only of the dead, who had lately been interred  in the church, reposed in his shroud ; there was no throbbing  in his bosom, and the smile of a happy dream played on his  countenance; but at tho approach of a living one he awoke;  he ceased to smile; he opened his dull eyelids with a painful  effort; the place of tho eye was void, and in that of the heart  there was only a profound wound; bo raised his bands; he  joined them  to pray; but the arms grew long; they separated from the body, and the joined hands fell to the earth.  "At ihe top of the vault of the church was (he dial of eternity; no numbers, no pointers were to be seen; but a dark  band revolved around it slowly, and the dead tried to reckon  the time. Then descended from on high, upon the altar, a  radiant figure, noble, exulted, and who bore the impress of an  imperishable grief; the dead cried out, 'Oh ! Christ! is there  no God?' He replied, 'There is none?' The shade's all  trembled, and Christ continued—'I have gone through the  worlds; I have risen above the stars, and there—there is no  God! I have descended even to the last limits of the universe; I have looked into the abyss and cried—Father,  where art thou?—But I heard only the rain which fell,drop  by drop, into the abyss, and the eternal tempest, that no order  governs, alone replied. Then, again raising my eyes lo the  vault of heaven, I found only a dark and bottomless vacancy  Etemity reposes on chaos and wastes it, and consumes itself  slowly: redouble your bitter and harrowing lamentations;  with thrilling cries let ihe shapes disperse, for now my task is  done."  "The despairing shapes vanished like the vapor which the  cold has condensed; the church was soon descried; but sink  lenly—dreadful spectacle!—the dead infants, who, in their  turn, had risen in the cemetery, ran and prostrated themselves  before the majestic figure which was upon the nltnr, and said.  Jesus, have not we a father?' And he replied, with a  torrent of tears—'We are all orphans—you nnd I—we have  no father ' At these words, the lemple and the children crumbled into dust, nnd ihe whole edifice ol the world, in ils immensity, dissolved before me."  AUTUMN.  The first severe frost had come, anil the miraculous change  had passed upon the leaves, which is unknown only in America,    The blood-red sugar-maple,  with a leaf brighter and  more delicate than a Circassian lip, stood here and there in  tile forest, like the Sultan's Standard in a host, the military and  far-seen aristocrat of the wilderness; the birch, with its spiritlike and amber leave's, ghosts of tho departed summer, turned  yet nlongthe edge ofthe woods, liko lining of the palest gold;  the  broad sycamore and the fan-like catalpa flaunted their  saffron foliage in the sun, spotted with gold: like the wings of  a lady-bird ; ihe kingly oak,  with  its summit shaken bare,  still  hid its trunk in a drapery of a sumptuous dye, like a  stricken monarch, gathering his robes of state about him to  die royally in bis purple; the tall poplar, with ils minaret  of  silver leaves, stood blanched like a coward, in the dying forest,  burdening every breeze with  its complaining; tho 'hickory  paled through its enduring green; the bright berries of the  mountain-ash, flushed with a more sanguine glory in the unobstructed sun; the gaudy tulip-tree, Sybarite of vegetation,  stripped of its golden cups, still drank the intoxicating light of  noon-day in leaves, than which the lip of an Indian shell was  nevermore delicately tinted;  the still deeper dyed vines of  the wilderness, perishing with the noble things whose  summer they bud shared, outshone them in their decline, as woman, in her death, is heavcnlier than tho being on whom in 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/376	376	377.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/377.jp2

A l.itcrt-iu:, dc-llrcrcd before- tbe Jefferson College ami WuBliingtoti Lyceum,  July 1,1837, by J. A. Van IIoksbn, A. H. of Jeir..-rm»n Coltego.  Air, President—Ladies nnd Gentlemen:—  I do not appear, at this time, with an eloquent and studied  speech adorned with all the flowers of rhetoric: I have climbed no clifted rocks, nor have I wandered along the hanks of any  winding stream, to gather decorations from the fair fields  of nature. I have selected no roses, unless it ho now  nnd then one which hung by the way-side;—and even  these, plucked by so rude :i hand, have, 1 fear, lost their fragrance.  Alan, tin.' lord of creation, made a liillo lower than angels  stamped with tho impress of his Creator, endowed with moral,  physical ami intellectual powers, the artificer of his own fortune; a free moral agent, destined for immortality, has, alas!  forgotten the high purpose for which he was created; has neglected tho government of himself; prostrated his noble energies, and ceased to reflect tho divine image I Tho government of ourselves, this little empire within, this pari of God's  moral kingdom over which we are placed as supreme arbiters, which should have been brought to the highest statu of  cultivation and refinement, and which should havodemanded  our first and highest attention, has been neglected, Wo have  suffered ourselves to float loosely upon the stream of life, with-  oul knowing whence il took its lis.', or whither it might  carry us. Instead of standing upon ihe haul; and watching  ihe Mowings and oddyings ofthe current, we have rushed into the stream; we have launched our frail hark within,l a  mil Icr, and been made the sport of the contending elements;  and many—alas! too many, have been lost—lost to themselves  and to the world!  Too late they find that the current lias swept them into the  boundless Ocean ; and, without chart or compass, they are  tossed from billow to billow, till soon they disappear and no  trace remains. While nil are ready to acknowledge the importance of self-government; while all are ready to, admit and  claim their right of sovereignty,—few have been found who  have ever exercised this power to its full extent, but have  rather suffered themselves (o be governed by the opinions and  savings of others. We find men who can lead their country's  marshalled hosts to ihe field of battle', who fear not the roar of  hostile cannon,who can brave (lungers, seen anil unseen; we read  of an Alexander, who, when he bad conquered the world,  mourned that there was nothing morethat he could subdue;—of  n Oicsar, who extended his conquests over a greater part of Europe ;—and of a Bonaparte, whose very name is synoiny inous  with military greatness;—yet neither of these generals ever  ventured to enter tho field in moral combat against their own  sinful appetites and passions! /And he, who has become complete master of himself, can boaswj victory, to which Ceesar and  Hannibal were entire strangers;—-a victory which was never  won by the blood which flowed upon the plains of Marathon;  and though his name may never have been enrolled upon the  page of his country's glory; though he may scarcely be know n  beyond the domestic circle; yet he exerts an influence which  will he felt by nations whose ancestors are yet unborn. But  to obtain such a victory it requires no common skill. We  have an artful and insinuating enemy to contend with; one  that intruded himself into the garden of Eden, and obtained a  victory over our first parents; and who has continued to increase in strength and numbers for six thousand years until  it has become a legion.—Yes, the appetites, the passions, ihe  prejudices, ihe vanities, ihe vices and the follies of the world  are arrayed against us: aud, on the one hand, pride, ostentation and vain-glory forbid an encounter ; while, on the  other, reason, conscience and judgment urge to the contest ;  and those only are persuaded lo take the field who have, from  infancy, received a regulat training in the school of moral  tactics. Such havo never failed of coming off triumphant;  have borne the palm. Ofthis number Wat- Epainiuondas, the  celebrated Thchuii general, renowned for bis virtues and for  his military accomplishments; his love of truth was so great thai  ho never told a falsehood in his life; and such was our own  beloved Washington, whose history is familiar to us all, or at  least ought to he. And how could I belter inculcate the doctrine of self-government, than by refering to ihe histories of  such men us a Bacon, a Newton, a Franklin and a Washing  Ion—unless it be to thai perfect model recorded in ihe Bible of  Jesus of Nazareth, whose history, from Bethlehem's manger  lo the hill of Calvary, has been so ably illustrated by the sacred historian, as to claim the attention and admiration of nil:  and has been the means of purifying and regenerating the  hearts of thousands. To a want of this self-control may be  attributed a vast amount of the crime, misery, degradation and  human suffering in our world. Intemperance, which has  done so much towards peopling our Jails, State-prisons,  Penitentiaries, Poor-houses, Alms-houses, Hospitals, arid Asylums, may be traced to this very source—want of self-control.  How many thousands of our fellow mortals, whose prospects  for a long and happy life were once as cheering us our own.  have1, from loo frequent indulgence in the intoxicating howl,  found a drunkard's grave ! yet bow many of this number, had  they been told the lirst time they took asocial glass with their  friends, that they had broken down the barrier between temperance and intemperance, that they had taken the first stop upon  the drunkard's highway,—would have believed il ? Even  those who take their morning, noon, and evening dram feel  perfectly secure ;and should you hint that they were in danger,  they would tell you that they could govern themselves, nor  would they thank you for your advice'. The drunkard, too.  as he is seen for the first lime reeling from the grogshop, will  boast his courage, bis manly independence; hut bis boasting  is in vain ; he has indulged too long; the appetite is formed : 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/379	379	380.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/380.jp2

Men of the greatest intellects  and of the brightest genius have alike been ruined by intemperance. How many young men who promised lo be a blessing  lo their parents, and an honor to their country, have, for the  sake of appearing more lively and social in the  company of from too kind parents—whose imaginations have been allot  has there been a crime committed, except by those who ha  been roughly educated, or have, too early, left the influent:  of the domestic circle—whose minds have received a wrot  Inns—whose desires and appetites have been unrestrained-  who have been suffered and indulged in every extravagant  their friends, quaffed the sparkling draught, until, toolate, they  found it left a real sting behind ? Let us remember, therefore,  that the step once taken in vice, the moral powersnro weakened, and our course is downwards. It has been said by the  poet, and a good judge of human nature,  "Vice la a monitor of eo frightful mien,  Tltaito Ijo linlcil, nccila out In l„- seen,  Hut seen 100 Ofl, familiar Willi Its fi ,  Wo Ural endure,—then plly,—ilien embrace."  Certainly, no man should consider himself secure from  this vice whoso motto is not, touch not, taste not, handle not.  And it must he a cause ol rejoicing to the Christian and the  philanthropist, that mankind are beginning to feel tho importance of this subject. Already the tocsin has been sounded.  The temperance banner has been unfurled in every part of  our In loved land, and thousands have flocked to its standard  and marshalled themselves to oppose the enemy. Vet much  inoro remains to bodono before we shall have arrived at that'"'"'  od to contemplate scenes of licentiousness, violence nr  blood—who have dwelt upon ludicrous and fictitious associ  lions, until their moral natures have become obtuse and rende  ed insensible to the finer feelings of humanity—and tin:  they have been led on from step to step until they have bi  come prepared to perpetrate, with impunity, every deed i  daring which fills the catalogue of crime I How iinportni  then, is it that parents should always keep in mind the saj  ing of tho wise man: "Train up a child in the way h  should go, and when he is old be will not depart from it."—  I have no doubt that mothers have more influence in forniin,  ihe character anil determining the destiny of a nation, thai  all their Moralists, Legislators and Divines combined.  1 In who would foretell our futuie history with any accu  racy, must look into the domestic circle,    Here  is laid tin  foundation upon which the noble edifice is to be reared.—  be'iit, the tree's inclined."

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  19  jtidice, by attachments or antipathies; whether self-love and  interest have been Ihe prevailing motives, or reason and judgment. We should examine our own conduct, the principles  and motives by which our lives have been governed, whether  we have based our actions on the great principles of moral  rectitude, or have only acted as we havo been influenced by  the impulse of the moment. In short, we should loam to  curb our imagination, direct our thoughts, and govern our  wills. Then, and not -till then, shall we hive accomplished  the great end of our creation.  Again, self-government is important, as it gives us a knowledge and teaches us the government of others. Human tin  lure has been essentially the same in every age of the world,  Men have ever been actuated and governed by flic same  causes; and be, who knows himself tho best, knows man ihe  best; or, in other words, is the best judge of human nature,  As in physics, like causes produce like effects, so in morals,  similar motives have bepii followed by similar actions : and  our world has, from time to time, been visited by war, pestilence and famine, and our land drenched with human gore  and rent by intestine feuds and commotions. To govern others, I say, we must know and govern ourselves. Alan is the  text hook, which we should constantly read; it is a  book which we always carry with us, (though, forsooth,  some have only a pocket edition), We must know our own  characters, dispositions nnd habits. And, although we would  sometimes gladly shrink from such an investigation) yet there  tells the real character. Our whole lives should frequently  be brought up before us in review. We should consider how  many opportunities for improvement we have lost; how many  things of importance have come within our own observation,  which have made no impression, but have given piece to  things of no value. And though wc may have lived long,  traversed sea and land, hoarded up the treasures of the earth,  and stored our minds with classic lore; though we may have  visited the tombs of our fathers, and held converse with the  silent dead ; though wc may have traversed the dark and subterranean caverns of the earth,—yet wo may have left unexplored a still darker recess in our own characters. Wc may  never have entered the human penetralia and held converse  with ourselves. Wc may never have studied the mechanism  of those movements by which external things make a lasting  impression upon the organs of sense. To understand this  process—lo know ourselves, we must,'I repeal, be active and  industrious.  Mm often the real character of others is veiled and con  ceiled by the mantle of hypocrisy ; by pride, affectation and  dissimulation ; and we can only know them,"as we know  and judge ourselves under similar circumstances. How important is this self-government and self-knowledge to him who  is iiilrnslcd with ihe government and education of others! How  responsible the situation of htm who is to give tone and character to those who are to wield the future destinies of our  nation, especially of those who are placed over our schools,—  colleges and other seminaries of learning. In an institution  like this, where are congregated young men of difl'erent dispositions, inclinations and habits ; to apply the right corrective  for gooil moral government, and to ensure a proper amount of  study, require a good knowledge of man.     And he will succeed the best who bus ihe best knowledge and command of  himself—who, instead  of getting angry  at  the  little freaks  which sometimes occur in College among young men of  buoyant and clastic spirits,—instead of watching and spying  every movement, and placing a sentinel  at every student's  door to awe and intimidate,—will  endeavour to persuade  then; to a right course of conduct, by appealing to theirsense  of honor, to their respect for themselves and for their friends.  He  will endeavour to  direct  and  cheer them   on their- wav  throtlgll the academic groves, and  greet them as  they enter  the portals of the temple of science.    He will tell them, that  every time they subdue the rising tumult within their bosoms,  they have obtained a victory over themselves which will tell  upon their future destiny ;  that every such victory will raise  them a step higher ill the scale of moral excellence.    AIora|  law always subdues without degrading, because it raises us in  our own estimation, instead of prostrating and degrading us .'  and the submission is agreeable because it is voluntary.    In  governing ourselves, we  exercise a high  prerogative, that of  sovereign king and lord.    Wc are not automatons—mere machines moved by external force, by the baser feelings of fear  and cowardice;   but by the nobler feelings of our nature, reason and judgment—tho noblest attributes  of Deity !    This  self-control is alike essential to the statesman, the divine, the  orator, and to all who would fill any of the great departments  of life.    The statesman in  the limes of political prosperity,  when no cloud darkens the horizon, when he is cheered by  the unanimous voice of his countrymen, when there are no  party strifes or contentions, may, though  he be not distinguished for his wisdom, legislate for the good of his country,  and for Ihe honor of the nation.  " When smooth old Ocean ami each storm's asleep,  Thon ignorance may plough the watery deep;  lltu whan tlio (lemons of tho tempest rave,  Skill must conduct tho vessel through the- wave."  Yes, in the times of great excitement) when party spirit runs  high, when the political elements are all in motion, when the  clouds of public calamity have thickened to a tempest, when  questions of great national importance are to be discussed and  settled,—then the skilful pilot must be at the helm ; then his  moral strength is brought to the test; then his philanthropy  and patriotism are tried ; anil how many have ever borne tho  test! how many have always acted according to their better  judgment !  The Divine, loo, in his work of mercy, should be what the  Bible is calculated lo make every ono who reads and understands it, " perfect in every good work." The Iiiblc represents man as he was, is, and ever will be. This is the standard by which man may try his real character; and the Divine  should so understand ihe character of man that be can mete  t a portion to each one in due season. Thus prepared anil  armed with the sword of the spirit, he should visit the humble  cottage as well as the royal palace. Like his Divine master,  he should visit the sick and the afflicted, and administer the  ealing balm of consolation. To preach with success, he  should know how lo govern his own feelings and the feelings 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/381	381	382.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/382.jp2

It is a mysterious  logic which unravels the most abstruse points in metaphysics  and ethics, and makes the rugged paths of science smooth and  easy.

The impressions of newspapers in the State of New-  York have been computed, with tolerable accuracy, at six  lee'll millions annually. Estimating this at one seventh pari  of the impression of the entire Union, it will give one hundred nu I twelve millions of sheets, as tho annual harvest  of the American newspaper press: about eight newspapers a year to every human being in tho United States, besides one periodical, onnn average of Gl page's, lo each individual capable of reading.  Th • array of names, that greets the eye of the inquirer  into the newspaper literature of the United States, is truly  laughable. We have the 'Globe' talking saucily to the '.Sun,'  anil ihe 'Sun'complimenting Ihe '.Moon,'and the 'Stars'courtesy-  ingtolho 'Comets-,'and the 'Torch high t'dnzzling the 'Deacon,'  and the 'Trunipei'soundiiigut the 'Clarion,'and die 'Bee' sling-  ing the 'Hive,'and the 'Gazclte'publishinglhe 'Advertiser,'who  advertises tho 'Courier,' which has run away uftcr ihe '.Messenger,' which has taken the 'Mail' lo catch the 'Idler,' who professes to be a lame 'Special! r' ofthe 'Eagle,' who overlooks ihe  'Hemisphere,' in search ofthe 'Keystone' ofthe 'Arch of Freedom.' We have a hundred 'Republicans,' as many 'Democrats  one 'Federalist,' twenty 'Spies,' and a 'Reflector,' gazing at his  '.Mother's Magazine' in the 'Mirror' of ihe 'Times.' We have a  'Pear!' ioenclo-o in a 'Casket,' together with a 'Southern Rose'  for the 'Lathes' Companion'—and we have a suitable " Offering" for Wolverines, Buckeyes, Hoosiers and Yankees.  A witty writer in tho Now York  .Mirror has many times  taken off", in a vein of sly humor, the Americanism of at  unpretending is the gazelle he takes. It is next to impossible  to fill a sheet fifty-two limes a year, without putting inlo it  something thai is worth the subscription price.  " Every parent whose son is oil' from him at school should  be supplied with a newspaper. I well remember what a  marked difference there was between those of my schoolmates  who had and those who had not access to newspapers,  Other things being equal, iho first was always decidedly  superior lo the last, in debate and composition at least. The  reason is plain ; they had command of more facts. A newspaper is a history of current events, as well as a copious and  interesting miscellany, which youth will peruse with profit  and delight, when they will read nothing else."  That a newspaper is primed in the outskirts of civilization,  with antediluvian looking type, and on paper never bleached  by the dews and rains of heaven, is no argument against its  power or influence.  Tear the lilile ill-looking sheet to shreds, and the fragments  as they are tossed through the fields by the winds, will still  speak, and say something that he who looks upon it will  either believe or know lo be fact and receive in aid of his  opinion, and as a make-weight in some theory.  The fads detailed by the press, and the sentiments there expressed, are the elements thai insensibly form public opinion.  li is not uncommon for an editor to hear tho same sentiment  (often in the very words) which ho had hut recently thrown  out, advanced to him again ns an original idea, by some one of  his readers, who hail forgotten or never knew the source from  laehing magniloquent titles to insignificant and miserably w|licll J|B obtniHfltl iti    Aml if that editor has always known  prinled newspapers i and Ihe Now York Knickerbocker has his own when it comes back again to him,  he may be well  lately made a dash at tin; same "infirmity of noble minds,"  that would seel;, by the larger, to elevate and dignify the  smaller.  Willi regard to the character of American Periodicals, Reviews, .Monthlies, Quarterlies, Annuals, .Magazines and .Miscellanies, I shall say  but little.    Many of them  have been  long before the  public, and  their reputations arc well established.   The gifted but unfortunate Donnie was tho father of  American Periodicals.   His Port Folio, established by him in  Philadelphia in 1801, survived him, and had a life of nineteen  years.    This was the first American publication that arrested  the public mind, and made a reputation lor ils editor, which  survives as his monument.   The North American Review was  established at Boston, in 1813 : il has been edited by Tudor  Sparks,   E.    T.  ('banning,   Ed.  Everett,   and  since 1830,  by   Alexander II.    Everett—acute    scholars    and   learned  critics all.   The Philadelphia and Now York Reviews are of  much more recent origin, and the Charleston Sou,hern Lite-  raty Review and Ihe Literary Messenger of Richmond were  still more recently established.    I pass without further notice  to a consideration of the influence of the American newspaper  press—the average ability with which it is conducted, and the  comparison it holds with the Journal press of other countries.  From Ihe observations of a life thus lar connected with the  press, I fuel prepared to adopt the language of the lion.  Judge Longstreet, who says :  " Small is ihe sum required to patronizo a newspaper, and  amply remunerated is the patron, I care not how humble and  thought of for philoprogenitivoness in acknowledging his own  offspring after their brief absence.  The circumstance that the political journals of our country  are ranged on the opposing sides of great questions of political  economy, and of the science of government,involving a discussion of the true principles of liberty and their fate, is no dis-  ndvantaugo to  iho progress and dissemination of enlightened  freedom ; on ihe contrary, it is truly essential to a full develops-  incut and a  fair understanding of the whole system of human  government, and all the principles of political freedom.  In law  it has been considered by all  civilized  nations necessary to  have opposing counsel and advocates upon every question at issue : then, why not as necessary to have opposing advocates to  plead for and against proposed measures or newly presented  hypotheses .'    How else can we arrive at truth and receive the  benefit of wisdom .'   The people al large form the jury of the  country by whose decision  men  and measures, projets and  principles rise  or fall: let  the ease bo well argued before ihe  jury previous lo their decision.    Again, the parlizan press respectively becomes the natural defender of tho rights of the  people against the encroachments of those who are in power,  or the designs of the ambitious who are out, as the case may  be.    Often too, talented and ambitious men honestly conceive  their own success or the success of their particular measures  or schemes as identical with the salvation of the country and  the rights of the people.      Here then it becomes tho solemn,  high and sacred duly of the press lo arouse the people, separate  their interests from ambitious schemes, and hurl back the as-  jfiiti 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/387	387	388.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/388.jp2

This will ever be  a delicate and difficult task, but ihe press, sustained by intelli  gent citizens, is equal to it.  Much of the power of a newspaper over public opinion  springs from the fact that it is the expression of a mass ; ii  declares a common sentiment; it is the organ of a party. lis  commendation or its censure, coining as it were from hundreds  and thousands, is influential and effective. A correspondent  (il'.i paper in this city, the present week, describes this influence  in language we can belter borrow than imitate.  Up Says :—" When the censure of the press, echoed from  paper to paper, as thunder from hill to hill, is taken up ami  responded lo by the great mass ofthe people, thus becoming  the denunciator*-' " voice of God himself." then indeed, is iis  influence potent and irresistible !  The stale argument used by the unthinking against die press  on account of its licentiousness, as i, is called, falls in the  ground from this consideration : Sctirilily always finds lis  level without injury to the character against which it is direct-  oil j while a close, searching, constant investigation must be  made into the character, ability, principles, acts, merits and demerits ol all men in public life, or who aspire lo stations in the  gift of their fellow citizens.    They tacitly consent to pass the  lierv ordeal when they limit themselves to run Ihe gauntlet  for public favor, and they should never wince or complain  should the shower, tho hail-stones and ihe scorpions fall thicker  and faster, and stint; die deeper ! For this llley listed, and a  faithful discharge of die stern duly ofthe censorship uf public  men is one of the holiest prerogatives of the Press ol Freedom !  No patriot who loves the Republic more than he desires his  own success, will complain of die open-mouthed, undisguised  expression of private opinion upon public men and public measures. The Constitution ofthe United Stales guarantees this  sacred right to iho Press ; and when that press shall cease to  wield it, il shall have heootne a traitor 10 ''oar country's cause."  The average amount of talent, engaged in conducting tho  American press, is, probably, unsurpassed in any civilized nation, although there are individual newspapers, both in England and France, where there is high talent engaged, and a  more rigid and systematic division of labor adopted in the  various departments. For instance, no American nowspaper  press is able to sustain such a number of literary attaches ns  the London Times, which has a daily circulation of 11,000  copies. It has 3 editors, 12 regular reporters, 3 proof and  news readers, 2 publishers, news collectors, foreign corres-  pendents and agents, besides a cashier, 3 clerks, 50 compositors, 12 attendants on ihe machinery. The London Morning  Herald is scarcely less expensive and ample in ils establishment; whilethe leading Parisian journals have each from two  in live editors, generally gentlemen as much distinguished  for their high birth as for their literary and political attain:  incuts.  It is said that there are more gentlemen of liberal cduca-  ■lion connected with iho political and news-press in the United  States than in the whole of Europe. To arrive at this conclusion, it should bo recollected that, the newspaper press of  this country is generally under the conduct of a single editor,  whose mind alone must grasp, study, digest and herald forth  news, morals, science, literature and polities; therefore, tho  classic mould, ihe set phrases, the well turned periods and  polished sentences, arc not as generally mi t with as in that  ofthe foreign press, where the division of labor is such that  but one subject is touched by one pen. What is lost ill polish  is more than gained in vigor and perspicuity, and the method  of our press is best suited to the genius of ihe American  people,  In point of enterprise, the American character would forbid us to be far behind in any pursuit; although it has not yet  transpired that any American newspaper was ever, as a late  London paper has been, sent oil' 200 miles into the country,  partly printed, in order lo be filled anil finished on the localiiy  of some exciting transaction. This was effected by sending  nil' mi edition with iho reporters, some printers and a lew  cases of type, sons to astonish the country ut large by seeing  tin- report of a celebrated provincial trial (he same hour it  ended, in a London paper, two hundred miles distant. This  was a solitary case for eflect Hut no European newspaper  establishment 1ms ever yet evinced the enterprise, or been at  the expense, of sustaining news-boats, ns the New York press  has, to scour ihe sens lor foreign vessels, and virtually extract  news from "the vasty deep" fifty leagues from shore.  The entire aggregate of the American newspaper press,  both in talent nnd in numbers, is highly flattering to the United States. The United Kingdom of England,Scotland nnt  Ireland, in 1833, sustained but 3G0 newspapers, of which  only 17 wen- daily—making only one third the number pub  lished by tho American pn ss. Out of London and Dublin  there is not a daily paper printed in the three kingdoms. In  France there were in 1820, 343 newspapers, of which 34 of  the Parisian journals wero daily. There is not a daily paper  published in Franco out of Paris. There are only three  daily papers in Paris and two in London, whose average daily  sale exceeds the subscription lists of some of the New York-  dailies. One great reason why the American news-press is  so much more prolific than the European, is, doubtless, the absence of stamp duties, and the free transmission by mail of  exchange papers and printed documents to editors and pub-  lisliersof American newspapers.  It belongs lo my subject, and would be u most pleasing part  of it—which I may indulge in at some future day—to institute mi examination into tho characteristics of the newspapers,  particularly ihe leading ones of the various towns of the  I Initial States; but iho I hue allotted to my essay will not now per-  niil ''• 1 have given a history of the press, and endeavored  bricflylo consider the mural influence nnd political power ol  tho American press, and also to contrast its enterprise and the  average ability with which it is conducted with the journal  press of other countries; nnd now, in concluding, I shall in-  dulgo in a few general remarks, but which will apply with  more force to our own  " Land, of every land the pride,  Belov'd of Heaven o'er all the world beside."  Il has been said that an accurate judgment may be formed  of the state of society in any city, village, or town, by mi examination of the papers published in those places, The  American press, more perhaps than that of any nation, is the  ■ ii^aga- .

Hymn ti) the Guardian Angel.—-The monkschaunted  " Angel of the Lord, spread over us thy prolccling wings:  Shelter us under them and console us with thy pity.    Thou  wort created the gentles' and tho most indulgent among all tho  virtues and the powers of Heaven, for thou wert destined to  succour and console man, to gnthi r together the it ars he sheds  and present them as an expiation before eternal justice."—  And thochildren answered, " Hope in the Lord.nll you who  mourn, for tho guardian nngel spreads his broad wing between man's weakness and his maker's wrath.'1    Then the  monks chaunted again, " 0 youngcsl mid most lovely of i!  angels, last created, for thou wert creeled nfler man, and  placed in Eden to be his companion nnd frien 1—but woman  came, and was more powerful tie a thou over the mind nl  man.—The Angel of Wrnth descended to punish tin in, bnl  thou didst follow them forth into th ir exile and watched ovi r  the children that were born unt i them."    And ihe children  answered again:  " &lt; I you ihat love God, thank iho (! nurd inn  Angel, wlio, on his rapid wing, incessantly mounts from Enrtl  Id Heaven, to bear the prayers of nun, and descends to bring  them  blessings."    And then the sweet voice of a young  monk chaunted, " It is thou that wilh warm breath revivifies  in the morning, the plants frozen by the cold of night; i1 i.-  thou, who, with protecting hand, sustainest at the cabin of tin  fisherman, when the furious winds coino raging from tho sen;  it is thou, who awakest sleeping mothers, and callestthcm with  a sweet voice, in the midst of the dreams of the night, to rise  •hul give suck to their now born; it is thou, who watchest  over ihe modesty of young virgins, mid turnest aside from  their couch, bid thoughts nnd impure dreams; it is thou, who  soatest, hyself at noon day by the cradle of the reaper's child,  -mil gunrdest it from the scorpion and the viper; and it is thou  who, when we seek for consolation in distress, dost turn for us  the leaves ofthe blessed Bible, and guides! us lo the text of  comfort." ERNEST.  METEOIHC SHOWER,  Tim appearance of an extraordinary number of meteors,  on the morning of the Kith of November, every year, for six-  years in succession, is certainly a very roiniirkabh: phenomenon, and would be scarcely credible, unless attested by iiielu.  bilnblo evidence. I, is one of those facts which philosophy  has failed to account for. The periodical shower that waste  occur last month, being anticipated by Professor Olmsted, of  V ah- College, lio sit up in order lo witness il, mid bus published his observations in the Now Haven Herald. Ilesiys  the magnitude of the phenomenon was inferior in those of  some other years, but it was marked with distinctive peculiarities, which left no doubt of its identity. On other occasions,  the hour when the greatest number was visible, w:v.&lt; 1 o'clock'  mi ,l,e hi.-t occasion, the number rapidly increasi d a,;) o'clock,  ami remained uniform for nearly three hours, nnd thonvcrage  number was one for every minute.  '1'be professor observes thnt the spots on the sun were very  remarkable for some days before.    On the l:;,b. theday preceding the appearance of the meteors, these spots were distri-  buted in eight groups, distinguished by ihe smallest telescopes,  and could he resolved into more than sixty spots, by means of  larger telescopes.    Tho wonder of this, phenomenon would  lie nothing in itself but consists in the regularity of its np-  pearanco on the same day of the same month, for six years in  succession, always between midnight and sunrise, and the  greatest number and brilliancy between three and 1 o'clock.  A large meteoric stone is said  lo have fallen on tho earth  about tho same lime, in tho neighborhood of Lako Georjre  weighing 42 pounds.    Could thero be any com tion between ibis meteoric stone mil the shooting stars that were observed nt  New Haven mid elsewhere?    The true origin of  ihe nne nr the other is not   known or lies not been disclosed  Some have supposed that the meteoric stoni s come from volcanoes in the moon, and npp larances in that plan it, ns indicated by powerful telescope.-:, exhibit tho resemblance of volcanic eruptions.   It is supposi d thai a projectile hurled from  the moon, nl Ihe rate of Slll'l) feet   per second, or four time's  the velocity of a cannon ball, would overcome the power of  ihe moon's attraction, and arrive in the sphere of thnt of our  planet in three days,    Whi ther or not this lie the true source  of these phenomena, wenrc noi well t nough versed in natural  philosophy lo eh lerinine.

We have just received intelligence that dinner  is nearly readyjand as tho medical class is yet lobe examined,  let the medical gentlemen therefore come forward.  ANATOMV.  /'.   What is a s;.lt-bo\ &gt;  ,'v   It is a body composed of wood, glue, nails, and hinges.  /'.  How is this body divided.  S.  Into external and internal,  /&gt;   Vcrygood: external and internal; very proper: and  what are the external parts of a sal,-box?  ,','. One fun lamental, four literals, and one superlateral.  P. An! hv.vdo you find the internal parts of a salt-box?  s Divided by a vertical membrane or partition into two  large cavities or sinuses,  P. A re- these cavities always equal ?  S. Tln-y used to be so formerly; but modern joiners have  found it best to have them unequal, for the more convenieii  accommodation of the viscera, or contents: tho larger cavity  for the reception of the coarser viscera, and the smaller for  tlie line.  P. Vory true, sir: thus have modern joiners, by their  improvements, excelled tho first makers of salt-boxes.—Tell  m ■ iniw, what peculiarity do you observe in the superlateral  member of (he salt-box ?  S. Whereas nil the oilier members are fixed and stationary  with respect to each other, the superlateral is moveable on a  pair of hinges.  /'. To what purpose is it so constructed ?  S. For the admission, retention, anil emission of the saline  particles.  Governor. This is sufficient.     Let us proceed to  SUROERV   AND   Till:   PRACTICE OF   PHYSIC.  /'. Mention a few of the disorders to which a salt-box is  liable.  S. A cracked and leaky fundamental; gaping of the joints  in the lateral; taxation of the hinges; and an accession and  concretion of filth and foulness, external nnd internal.  /'. Very well. How would you treat these disorders 1—  Begin with the first.  S. I would caulk the leaky fundamental wilh pledgets of  low, which 1 would secure in the fissuro by a strip of linen  or paper pasted over. For tho starting lateral points, 1 would  administer powerful astringents, such nstho gluten comuosa,  nnd would bind lb" parts together by triple bandages, until  the joints should knit.  /'.   Would you nol assist with chalybeate.*?  S. I would all tcA'th ■ disease with prepared iron, in doses  proportioned to the strength of the parts.  /'.  How would you manage ihe luxation of ihe hinges?  S. 1 would first ovnnine whether it was occasion, d by the  starting ofthe points which annex the processes to the superolateral or ils antagonist; or by a loss of tho fulcrum ; or by an  absolute fracture of ihe sutures. In the first case, 1 would su'  cure the process by a screw; in the second, I would bring the  sutures together, nnd introduce die fulcrum ; and in the last, I  would entirely remove the fractured hinge.and supply its place,  pro tempore, with one of leather.  /'. Very well, sir; very well. Now for your treatment  in case of accumulated foulness, external and internal.—But  first tell me how ibis foulness is contracted,  8. Externally, by ihe greasy hands of the cook ; and internally, by the solutions nnd adhesion of the saline particles,  /'. Very true; and now for the cure.  S. I would first evacuate the abdominal vessel, through  iho prima via. I would then exhibit detergents and diluents;  such us the saponacious preparation, with plenty of aqua  fonlana.  P.  Would not at/un cmlestis answer better?  S. Yes: plenty of aqua ea/estiswilh the marine sand. I  would also apply ihe friction brush, with a brisk and strong  hand, until the excrcmentitious concreto should be totally dissolved and removed,  /'. Very proper.   What next?  S. I won hi use the cold bath by means of a common pump.  I would then apply lintal absorbents; and, finally, exsiccate  the body by exposition , either in the sun, or before the culinary or kitchen lire.  /'. In what situation would you leave the superlateral valve  during the exsiccating operation ?  S. I would leave it opm to the extent, in order that the ra-  rilieil humidities might escape from the abdominal cavities or  sinuses.  ( IIYMISTin.  P. You have mentioned the saponaceous preparation : how  is that prociii't .1 I  S. By the action of a vegetable alkaline salt upon a pin-  guidinous or unctuous substance.  /'.  What is salt?  ,S. It is u substanco sui generis, pungent to the taste, of an  antiseptic quality ; and is produci tl by crystallization, or the  evaporation ofthe fluid in which it is suspended.  /'.  How many kinds of sail occur in a salt-box ?  S. Two: coarse nnd line.  P. You have said that the saponaceous preparation is pro-  curcd by the action of an alkaline sail upon a pinguidinous or  unctuous substance.    Describe (he process.  S. I f u ''-rent quantity of strong ley ho. procured by passing  water throne ii tho wood-nshes, and if a very large body of a  pinguidinous habit should be immersed in this ley, and exposed lo a considerable heat, ihe action ofthe ley, or rather of  the salts with which it abounds, upon the pinguidinous body,  would cause tho mixture to coagulate into soap.  Notice was given ut this instant that the dinner was on the  table: the examination was concluded, and the parties separated; the examiners rejoicing in the anticipation of a feast, and  the examined happy in finding the fiery trial over.

INTER   SYLVAS   ACIDEMIA   QUSRERE   VER1IM.  VOL.   1.  NATCHEZ, JANUARY   15, 183S.  RKPOHT  OF THE COMMITTEE  OP THE TRUSTEES OF lEPTERBON COLLEGE.  Appointed by resolution of the Bonn] of the 3yd'August, 1837; which directed  "lo inquire into ihe causes which hitvc oiierttteil lo restrict the usefulness of  Jenerson Oolfege, lo Ihe education of the very limited manlier of students  which hove been entered during Iho present year; nut! to recommend some  means of acquiring for II, hi a greater degree, the confidence ami favor of the  public, as well as to ensure lis permanent populnrily and prosperity."  In prosecuting the enquiry which, by tho resolution of the  Board of the 22d August last, we were directed to institute  for the purpose of ascertaining the causes which have operated  to limit tho usefulness of Jefforson College to tho narrow-  sphere by which it se'ems to bo circumscribed. Your committee have been led td examine minutely into its organization, progress and condition.  We do not propose to inflict on you a detail of all the cir  cumstances of its history, for more ihan thirty years, through  which we have travelled; but merely to refer youv as briefly  us possible, to such of ils most prominent incidents nSjj|re essential to our inquiry.  In the year 1802, Jefferson College was established by the  Legislature of the Mississippi Territory, nnd invested will,  the inestimable privilege of being supported by voluntary  contribution from the public. With this; endowment, and its  good name, it commenced its career; nnd After0 (our through  this and an adjoining county, in quest of an abiding place,  (wc believe it weqt no further,) it cventuully returnee! to its  present site, where it became permanently fixed: not, however,  without various conlests in the community, for the possession  of the bantling, including, of course, ihe benefits it was expected to confer, by iho apprccialion oLp&gt;operty, at the point  of ils location. . • §f  Learning, by this time, what was to bo expected from  "voluntary contribution," the trustees deemed it expedient to  turn their attention to a source promising- to be more available, and endeavoured to take possession of a property in the  City of Natchez, which, in tho mean time, had been granted  to tho Institution by the Congress of tho United State's; on a  part of which there were said then to have been some inconsiderable buildings, previously occupied by the Spanish gov-  ernineni; ihe leases of which, it was thought, would aid in  its support. They were met, however, by the conflicting  claims ofthe city; the authorities of which made application  to Congress, and, incredible as it may seem, subsequently obtained a grant in its behalf of the same property. A suit at  law, of about twenty years duration, expensive anil oppressive,  to an institution without revenue, was the alternative; and  was terminated only a few years since by compromise.  It was.not, we believe, until about tho year 1810, eight  years after it was incorporated, that the Institution went into  operation, by transferring to the College grounds a day school,  under the charge of a most estimable and respectable gentleman : In other words, the flag of the Washington Academy  was struck, and that of Jefferson College was hoisted in its  stead. Tho standard of the Institution, all it had to bestow,  failed, we believe, as a rallying point to the friends of learning; it brought no increase of patronage, and whatever success was enjoyed, was attributable to the private woith and  reputation ofthe gentleman at its head, for whose sole emolument it was conducted. From this period, n mixed school  for both sexes was generally kept up, with but little encouragement from the public, after tho gentleman, rilerrt tl  to, abandoned the profession of instructor.  About the close of the year IS 16, the Legislature commenced an experiment upon the disposition of the public to  sustain our domestic institutions. It was thought, that, if-the  Institution could lie supplied with suitable officers, it would  establish a character and be patronized; and ihat such piifieii-  age would, in future,'support it. It was in a dilemma; To  establish a character il was necessary to have students. To  procuro students it seemed essential that it should possess  character, The determination, however, was taken, to provide a salary for four years, to be paid to an indicated invid-  ual, annually, from the State Treasury, on his being Appoint-  ed the President. Accordingly, one of the most profound  scholars in the Union took charge of the Institution. To  give better eflect to this experiment, and within the term of  Mr. McAllister's employment, the Trustees engaged, as a co-  luborer in the institution, a clergyman ol high reputation lor  literary attainments; who, being from Princeton College, of  which his father was President, it was thought lu's employment would be highly popular and advantageous.  In what manner these efforts were met by the public, ami  what patronage they procured, is well known to many individuals in this Board. The fact is almost incredible, that,  within this'period, ihe number of students sometimes did not  exceed fifteen or Iwcnty.  The issue was, that the institution was heavily involved in  debt, and gained nothing in reputation.  F.arly in 1819, by reason of a land mania then prevailing  in Alabama, the Trustees were enabled lo realize a considerable sum on account of a Township of land, which ihe Sec  retary of ihe Treasury had located for the benefit of the In-  stilion, on the Tombigbee River. Elated with this success,  and not doubting that the remaining instalments of the leases  of those lands would be paid, the Trustees caused the present  College edifice to bo ereclcd. It was, however, barely completed before the land-bubble, like others of more recent dale,  burst; tho land reverted to tho College, and was found lo be  valueless. The Institution was plunged into a debt of about  fifteen thousand dollars in this attempt to anticipate its resources  and build up a College and provide Professors for it. The  building, however, was provided. This edifice, well built,  omfortablo and commodious—capable of accommodating a  hundred students, at least; and how were these efforts of the  Trustees met by the public 1 Did students flock to these halls ?

A large portion of these debts wore assumed anil paid by  some of the persons co'rilposingihe Board nt that time, and a  lew of their friends; some id whom, after an interval of  twelve or fifteen years, have not yi 1 been reimbursed. So far  from deriving any rcveriue from public pntroiaagf?, during  this period, some of those debts were c online ted on account  of Instructors; the tuition received In ing insufficient to discharge their salaries!  To pursue these reminiscences to a more recent poribd,-we  comonexl to that only bright era in its history, when the In-  stittition was organized on the military plan, and placed in the  rim;.. 'of Messrs. Willistonnnd Holbrook. Then we hadn  distiiiBl manifestation of public approbation mid favor.

Holbrook.  'I'll is I'vrii: occurred hear the most important crisis in the forum- o, the Institution. Relief from debt and pecuniary cm-  baii'.is oii'iil, and a permanent nnd ample revt'iiiie, were then  In ci tain prospect. An act pf imparallelled liberality, ob-  tnim I :'. ... Congress nt n most important juncture, was in  progress i execution, and gave assurance, that the Trustees  need nevi r again lie' dependent upon tlio capricious favor of  the public, for the means of conducting ihe institution; and  ii is from this period, about thirtyyears after i, i 'as chartered,  that its i rustenct i hould properly be d -led. Perha] 9 the sud-  den transition, from poverty to nflluencc, gave rise to extravagant views nn.l expectations. It led to a recurrence to old  established systems, based upon a preference for the cultivation of the ancient languages, rather than tin; acquisition of  more practical mid scientific knowledge; and inspired something, not unlilcecontcmpt, for the adventitious aids of modern  innovations.  li dissipated the lessons, and lost us, for n time, the advantages of past experience. Eager to anticipate the expectations  of ihe public, before a dollar was available from ihe proceeds  of the college lands, some of the Trustees raised a loan, subsequently discharged, which was so invested as to afford some  income until the resources of tho Institution should be real  ized.    Professors were employed, their numbers increased,  nnd salaries enlarged, from time to time.    For this the whole ft  income of the college has not sufficed, but considerable in. I  roads have been made upon its capital.    The proportion existing between the expenditures for professors, and the receipts  for tuition, during this period, show plainly with what eflect £  this lias been done.    The proportion, for the past session, he-  ^  tween those items being more lhan seven to one ngainst the  Institution.  For that period, we have been paying, at the rate  of more than seven thousand dollars per annum, for educating  '  ess lhan fifty students.  Such, in part, have been the fortunes of Jefferson College  They bear a striking similitude lo the numerous struggles  which have attended the oldest and best institutions of leant- *./.  ing in ihe Union, and form the ordeal, it would seem, through  which all must pass to arrive at a tolerable 'degree of ma-     '.  turily.  From this review, and all ihe information we have ac- I  quired, (ho conclusion, to our minds, is irresistible, that the   :'.-.  community is greatly in default to this Institution.    How- mF]  ever   humble  may havo  been   its   pretensions — however I  imited its means, it has never, during its whole career, re-   '■'  ceived that degree of patronage to which it was entitled ; we ■   »  except, of course, the period of ils military organization, ■  We say that this Institution has not received that support  from the public to which it was entitled and had a right to  claim, if the policy and necessity of clearing institutions of  learning at home be admitted.    But this is a conclusion •*■_"'  which we believe the people of our State are far from having I  arrived at; at least they do not act upon that principle:  The general diffusion of wealth in our country enables  almost every ono to send their sons abroad for education, t  .•onrse lo which a variety of circumstances impels them:—  imong these arc the gratification of the pupil,—the advantages of travel in enlarging Iho mind, maturing tho understanding, and in imparting in early life a knowledge of the  world, and keeping up an intercourse with and an attachment for friends, relatives, or institutions, which the parent  has cherished and desires to perpetuate.  Nol iho least of these, perhaps, is the rational nmbitioa,  shall we nol say, of deriving their collegiate honors from the .'  ilma mater of some of that multitude of worthies, whose high  names and bright destinies have conferred a lustre upon our  country. True, ihero arc some fearful hazards of moral  contamination in this removal from paternal restraint; but '  have the numerous instances of ruined hopes and blasted expectations rendered these risks less frequent?  Indeed, it must be admitted, that in the state of tho morals .  of our own country, and the force of example, by which I  youth is encompassed, wo cannot feel assured of security in I  this respect in our own public institutions.    The strictly pru-1  dent, therefore, seek safety for their offspring in solilary in-1  struction; and, in consigning their sons to private tutors, arc .      |  content lo sacrifice something in the variety and profundity ■ '  f their knowledge, to preserve their minds pure and their . •£ (  morals unblemished.

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  88  insitutions, for the purpose of pursuing, to its completion, a  course of liberal and 'classical education) nor, indeed, wi  they bo generally resorted to ns n preparation for the more  venerated northern universities. The difficulty, then, of  raising olir domestic institutions of learning to even an ap-  . proneh to eminent distinction, exists in the condition and feelings of society, Under this state of things, colleges may be  endowed, and professorships crealed, but it will only ho to real,  ize the sarcasm, of "the empty dome and pensioned preceptors."  Until tho feelings, views and interests of the communily  in which we live, are brought to co-operato in giving support  and celebrity to our institutions, they must, notwithstanding  their revenues and endowments, wither in comparative obscurity.  This adaptation of tho public sentiment to such ends, seems  ever to have been, in all communities, a tardy process. How  , long since Virginia herself, "the Ancient Dominion," or her  sister States, ceased to bo tributary to Harvard, to Yale, or to  Princeton ; and, in turn, through what neglect and adversity  did they pass to their present proud rank and enviable pre-eminence. However it may- be desired, it is not to be expected,  that they, with their amassed stores of learning, their ac-  & cumulated honors and reputation will have less hold on the  regard of the people of Mississippi than of other States, or  that the vast improvements of the ago, and the imparallelled  facilities of traversing the remotest corners of our extended  country, will fail to allure votaries fiom every quarter to their  venerated shrines.  Such, in our belief, are the primary—the essential causes  that  havo restricted   the usifuhicss of Jefferson College.-  Minor difficulties, however, exist, of sufficient moment to r  quire some notice at our hands.    The most erroneous notions  seem lo prevail   in  relation to this institution, even ainom  (hose who might easily have been bettor informed, particular  ly as regards its resources and income.    It is generally understood to be richly endowed.    What aro tho facts?    Until  the sale of its lands, in 1833, it had no fixed income.    The  first payment, under those sales, became duo  about  March,  183-1.    Of iho instalments falling due at that lime, and those  of 1835, '3G and '37, a considerable portion has not been paid.  Sojn'e of the purchasers have not yol paid one cent.    The  periods for the final payments do not arrive until  the year  18311, from Marchto August,—until when, tho Trustees can- ,u   ^^j,,,,,  not effectually  coerce payment from the defaulters,    The jjfcjjtenctl de  mortgages then render the debts secure.    Nearly the only*  income, (that accruing from tuition being very incoiisjjjprn  bid,) arises from tho investment of tho moneys rcceijfM fo;  college lands.    The whole amount  of tho interest  on the  moneys invested as a permanent fund, and the tuition received  has (iccn expended in ihe employment of a President nnd  Professors, and other considerable expenditures which have  been incurred on account of purchases for the library and apparatus, and in otherwise preparing the Institution for tho reception and education of students.  Much of this information is to bo found in the  reports on  die finances of March and August last.    For convenience,  however, we subjoin a summary statement of the fiscal condition of the Institution to the period of the latest disbursement.  The institution possesses  Real Estate, valued at        -        .        -        $43,150 00  Rank Stock, amounting to -        - 01,500 00  Bills receivable, - 77,142 O'.l  Suspended debt, .... 57,313 80  Library and apparatus,       -       -       . 3,000 00  Special Deposito in off. P. Bank, Columbus,    1,772 90  Cash, 3,148 70  The debts ofthe Institution; due principally to the Stale  and the city of Natchez,Will, in 1339, amount to about  827,000.  This statement will show that tho Trustees are expending  on instructors all they have properly a right to touch for that  purpose. The salaries, if not satisfactory to the recipients,  are certainly such as lo command the most respectable grade  of talents, and are far greater, we fear, than the amount. I  benefit conferred on tho community would authorize, if we  refer to our catalogue of students. Of salaries, we believe  they should not be subject to increase or diminution during  the incumbency of any officer. This would save" the board  many harrassing iinpoiluin'ties, and rid it of one cause of dissatisfaction and murmuring.  The destruction of the .Steward's house, and the dispersion  of the students in private fnnilies, have doubtless, in some degree, been prejudicial—principally so as regards the enforce- .  mcnt of discipline. r  Oilier schools have flourished, however, urieler siuiilttwlfs-  ldvnntagcs; and it is known to us that some have href! conducted with great success without a Slcwmd's department.  Indeed the disadvantages could not have proven very -g^eat,  when we recollect that parents have generally considered it n  valuable privilege to be suffered to board tboir children in  private families, rather than in commons. Although few, il.-'  any private families were anxious to have the hoarding ol  students, still five.tin,isns many as applied last session could  have been very comfortably provided ibr. A building, how-  ever, fdr Ihe accommodation of the Steward's department;  bavin" bee'n contracted for since ibis committee was raised  affords an opportunity of removing this difficulty.

Oilier denominations rear their institutions in different quarters, pi i  haps with similar advantages; each look within themselves  chiefly for support. There is-no interference with each (•!,  er's rights or privileges. They exist in their own pecnllai  limits, promote- their own legitimate interests, upon which  none desire to encroach.

The Legislature thought proper, in chartering this institu  tion, to require the Trustees to "take effectual care that students of all denominations should be admitted to equal advantages, and, receive alike fair and generous treatment, eye. " It can, therefore, never be committed to the exclusive control of any religious sect: in this, there would  be an infringement of rights, and would, wc are persuaded,  justly provoke the enmity and opposition of all others. As  it is, we cannot believe that, in this enlightened age of toleration, tho class of the community whose peculiar province  and pursuit it is to cultivate "peace, good will and-charity,  with all mankind," could be arrayed against an institution designed lo enlighten, refine and ameliorate the condition of society. In the organization and conduct of this Institution  throughout, we can discover nothing to provoke either jealousy or hostility from such a quarter.  Tho Trustees arc taken indiscriminately from persons of  all persuasions! Clergymen of all denominations, within a  convenienl distance, have been from timeto time elected into  the board. On various occasions clergymen have filled ihe  Presidency, or important professorships, and the same offices  have been repeatedly tendered to olheis. Of the present faculty, we learn that some of them are connected, by membership, with some of the churches; of which, wo arc well assured, the board have never thought it necessary to inquire.  Of all the Professors; we do them but justice to say, that we  believe them to he men of exemplary moral deportment.  The moral tone and religious tendency of tho President's  sentiments, are as well known nnd appreciated, as his gentle:  manly deportment and conciliatory manners are approved  and admired.  Weapprchend that in.tho feelings of ihe faculty, a leaning  has been towards the languages, rather than to the arts and  sciences, in a degree prejudicial to the wants and interests of  the great mass of the community—of those who propose lo  educate their sons at home.  'I'o meet, in some degree!, the distinct manifestation of the  public desire in this respect, the Professorship of Civil Engineering, Surveying, &c. was established. Why it is continually referred to, and regarded as "sinecure," we know not.  We are well assured tho board meant it as no such thing.  Tho knowledge lo be acquired- in that department, together  with a comprehensive course of instruction suited to a preparation for commercial pursuits, will attract more students to  the institution than any other inducement that can be held  out. and lo abstain from such a course, is virtually, we believe, to close the door upon nine tenths of the youths of Mississippi.  Wo promised to recur to the subject of the IMilitary System practiced by Messrs. Williston nnd Holbrook. We do  so now, not with a view of discussing its merits in detail, but  to express our conviction that thai system, without in the least  neglecting the classics, embraced a course more consonant to  die pursuits and interests of our youth, than any other; and  by no other plan that has been devised, can southern youth  be brought under so rigid and wholesome a discipline as they  maintained.  It is not our purpose to urge, at this time, a recurrence to  this system, to which we are aware that many, whose opinions are entitled to great deference, are opposed.  We would say, let every member of this board by his presence, influence and exertions, unite in giving the present organization and the faculty connected with it, a fair and impartial trial, with a liberal and energetic support, to the close of  the session. If the experiment then fails—if there is not then  u large accession of patronage, and the most unequivocal evidences of future prosperity—why, experience has taught us  what tho public approve, and it will be high time to resort  to it.  We would not be understood as yielding to despondency.  This institution can be made of great utility. Whilst reflection chastens our hopes, and experience restrains inordinate  expectations, they should stimulate us to renewed efforts for  the attainment of its true and permanent interests. Reason  dictates a firm, uniform, and persevering policy, in the application of tho whole of its accumulating revenues to the most  effectual promotion of the end for which it was created, by  which so much, at least, cannot fail to be accomplished, that  the pursuit of education abroad, will be merely a matter of  choice—not of necessity.  In conclusion, to comply with the latter member of the  resolution under which we act, we will only add, with great  deflerence, the following brief suggestions :  1st. That tho additional buildings necessary for all the de.  pertinents of the Institution be erected with nil the despatch  which its funds will admit of, and without causing an interruption in ils current operations: that they be carried on upon a  uniform plan, adapted to permanency and utility, not expensively ornamental, but with a proper regard to agreeable effect.  2d, That the whole amount of the tuition received (until it  exceeds 8 2,000 per annum) be set apart for the annual increase of ihe library, apparatus, and mineralogical cabinet.  3d. That the whole nett income of the Institution, after  providing for the foregoing objects, be appropriated to the  maintenance of the several professorships that are, or maybe established; and that additional professorships be created  as income accumulates, and the increase of patronage may  require.  4th. That a Chaplain be appointed to lecture to the students  every Sunday, at one of the churches in the village, and also  to deliver a lecture on the History of the United States, on  cry Saturday morning to the students in the'Preparatory  department: that he be appointed annually, in rotation from  all the denominations of Christians in the State, and be nominated to ihe Trustees by a permanent board of Clergymen ol  11 persuasions, to be chosen by the Trustees.  5th. That in filling future vacancies in the Board of Trustees, selections be made of persons having sons whom they  wish to educate in the Institution, and who may be not merely  witling to serve, but desirous of serving—having a proper regard, of course, to the ability of such persons to be serviceable  to the institution.  f  •&lt;« .  t  c  s  c  c  ti  t  SI  I  tl  tc  dt  in  di  ai  th  ry  pa  Ire  qu  del  ex,  bui  not  lati  sid  .rap  In  am  gra 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/401	401	402.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/402.jp2

To -run Ficl-i.tv, the President and Processors:  Gentlemen:—Agreeably to the invitation so politely extended to us, the undersigned were in attendance, more or  less, during the days'of College Examination, designated in  the official notice, and by comparing and collating the obser-  " -. vations which we individually made, are happy to present the  following report as tho result:—  Dividing the studies embraced in the examination, into the  »    Preparatory, Classical and  Mathematical Departments, we  ■ shall proceed to notice them in course:   The examination of  .   students in the primary studies under the charge of Professor  ■    Van Hoesen, although a brief and limited one, exhibited a  • *■   close and critical attention on the part of their teacher (and a  "    corresponding improvement on the part of the students) in  grounding them in the earliest and elementary principles of  I:     education.    Of a course so important to the welfare of every  \ literary institution, this gentleman seemed fully aware, and  r"  the success of his exertions appeared, to the Board, to be fully  proved by the proficiency of his pupils, the evident result of  I   ■    the united energies and perseverance of both the teacher and  tho taught.  r-' Tho Latin Classes, under the charge of Professor Wyche  were examined in Ctesar's Commentaries, in the Bucolics and  jEneid of Virgil, and in tho Odes and Satires of Horace,  These several exercises wore strict and searching, as the portions selected for examination were generally the more diffi-  • cult passages and calculated to test the improvement of the  students. We take pleasure in expressing our unanimous  opinion, that tho Latin classes exhibited a proficiency highly  creditable to themselves and to tho critical method of instruction pursued in tho College. The younger class in Cesser's  Commentaries went through their examination with entire  satisfaction to the Board. The translations from Virgil and  Horace evinced a clear conception of the meaning ofthe au  thors, expressed with ease and fluency, and with a due regard  to the idioms of ihe original language. If there were any  deficiency, it was in a knowledge of syntax. In their examination on the hexameter verse of Virgil and Horace the slu-  » ' dents exhibited a good knowledge of the rules of prosody  and scanning—belter, perhaps, than in the irregular verse of  ihe Odes of Horace, the latter being more difficult of mastery than the former. Their pronunciation of the Latin was  particularly pleasing and correct.  Tho Greek Class, under Professor Wyche, was examined  from Gracca Majora, in selections from Herodotus, and acquitted themselves respectably in tho translation, with some  defect of fluency in reading; but, as a whole, the Greek  • examination was creditable to all concerned. The class had  but recently taken up Graeca Majora, and were consequently  not so familiar with the reading (we do not now refer to trans •  laticn) of tho eleler Greek authors: Indeed, it requires con.  siderablo practice in reading the Greek to attain an easy,  •   rapid, flowing enunciation of that rich and sonorous language.  "'   In taking leave of the classical department, the Bonrd of Ex.  amination cannot but recommend a constant recurrence to the  ; -'  grammar and tho elementary principles of bolh ihe Latin and  -.  Greek languages by the student, even after he shall have commenced the reading of the higher authors, as the only sure  basis for a deep and enduring knowledge ofthe learned languages. The memory cannot be too frequently tasked with  their rules, exceptions, the variations and elementnry idioms.  The examination of the students in the Mathematical Department, in charge of Professor Forshey, reflected much  credit on that gentleman's capability and method of instruction. They were examined in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, nnd surveying, and exhibited, in a good degree of perfection, the power of retaining in mind and connecting the various  steps in any given problem, while conducting them, consecutively, to the final demonstralion. The Board of Examination  feel fully satisfied that the instructions in this department have  been close, searching, deeply scientific, as well as practical.  Although the mode of tuition is similar to that pursued by  the mathematical classes in the celebrated West Point Institution, yet the Board feel a pleasure in saying, that its best  recommenelation, in their opinion, stands in the improvement  of the students who have had the advantage of Professor For-  shey's accurate and skilful instructions.  In conclusion, the Board of Examinatibn congratulate the  Faculty of Jefferson College on the successful progress of  their experiment in favor of southern collegiate education—a  subject as dear to State pride and patriotism as to science and  literature.  The Committee feel the more confident that the institution  will hereafter justify the anticipations of its friends, inasmuch  as President Dubuisson has now returned and will be able to  exert an active supervision over the different classes in college  from which ho was prevented, during the most part of las,  session, by his absence and the illness of his family-  Respectfully, your ob't serv'ts,  Tuos.

Then let me, reverent, with uncovered head,  Unrol the cerements that enshroud the dead,  To question voiceless tongues, now stiff and chill,  And make the Past responsive lo my will,  Will Science from her sacred altar here,  Will cold philosophy, with smile severe,  rjepulse a Lecture woven into verse ?  Indued, a curtain lecture might be worse !  But, be not rash—for verse is often prose,  And poor at that, as every school-boy knows.  If sterner man shall turn in scorn away  From fancy's sketch and pool's artless lay,  Still there's a court of high and last appeal—  The female heart has not forget to feel;  There, still has Poetry a queenly throne,  And deems ihat blessed region—all its own.  From (he wide bosom ofthe shoreless Past  Dim shadows, from old mounds and temples cast,  Loom into sight and vainly strive lo tell  How once they lived, and how, at last, they fell;  And could not history one word inscribe  On the lone tomb-stone of a mighty tribe 1  And were there leaves in Nature's volume none  To register the Children of the Sun,  Whose thousands trod our ancient woodlands o'er.  And reared their domes on Mississippi's shore?  They lived—they loved! the warrior's mighty voice  .Made the wild echoes of these woods rejoice,  And song of virgin innocence uprose,  Soft as Zophyrus in the evening blowi,  And tunes teolian minstrelsy to sound,  Till music quivers in the air around.  They worshipped, loo, in solemn temple's shude  i Iroad with the shrines their own slrong hands had made  High o'er the graven altar proudly shone  The Sun God flaming on his earthly thrpno ;  Wild was ihat worship, veiled in Persian riles,  Such fire as Zoroaster's pupil lights,  And human sacrifice, as Baal demands,  Was oft times offered up with bjoody hands;  But when the Song of Sacrifice rose clear  An angel harper might have paused lo hear—  So soft—yet loud—a thousand tongues repeat  Tho Incas' litany, so wildly sweet:   And this the Chaunt:  Tho Night hath charms,  But the day hath fire,  And even at night,  The flame shoots higher!  The Moon is soft,  But the Sun is strong;  It rolls in power  lis glory along.  It lights to war,  It blazes in battle,  It strengthens the brave,  When arrows rattle.  To the Fire God, then,  Lift tho thunder roar,—  The multitude voice  Of Seas on the shore I  Long years have passed, since first to yonder shore  The gallant ships of France her soldiers bore,—  Since Rosalie's stern frowning ramparts stood  In pride above the Mississippi's flood.  Tho lily banner threw ils virgin sheet  On gentle winds, with spicy fragrance sweet,  And the deep cannon thundered the delight,  Of warlike chevalier and courtly knight,  To see this glorious land—ils Eden flowers—  Its olden forests—its romantic bowers,  And feel, with each successive brcalh they drew,  Sensations strange, unutterably now.  A world so bright—so lovely to the eye—  A balm upon ihe air like Italy—  A sky that deepened far and soft above,  The ocean element of Nature's love!  Oh, 'twas a splendid scene at night to view  The stars gaze elown the labyrinth ol'bluej  Like eyes celestial, deep entranced to see  Such beauty thrown o'er hill and vole ami tree!  Bui hark! how solemn roars ihat nightly "'in  Proclaiming weary day and duly done—  Then beats along the lines the reveille—  Btrange'Sounds were these to Indian chivalry!  The Children of the Sun drew near to scan  This proud and strange variety of man,  Much wondering, thinking that they came  Strait from the Sun,—inheritors of flame.  But Gallia's gallant sons, soon understood  By the fair moons, made ancient habit good,  And breathed soft sighs in Indian maiden's ears,  Smiled when she smiled, and gave her beads for tears,  And swore, with many sacres, uttered well;  How passing fair was every Natchez belle !  Thin Natchez belles were beautiful, and spreael  The boars' oil unction thick from foot to head ;  And then, to give the finish to their grace-,  Laid gouts of paint upon tho glistening face ;  On ono cheek black—upon the other green—  The forehead red—was e'er such beauty seen I  Rings in the cars and pendants in the nose,  1  « 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/403	403	404.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/404.jp2

Northward from Rosalie, tho hunters went,  And heard an Indian widow's lone lament ;  Her chief; tho "Thunder Cloud," in battle fell;  She sought his grave in yonder shady dell.  The sun was low o'er Mississippi's wave  Bathing in gold the sachem's lonely grave,  When she approached, slow from the solemn gloom  Of arching pines, above the warrior's tomb;  In silent grief awhile she stood—then sung  Till every echo of the forest rung,  With tender tones, breathed low, yet sadly shrill,  Like night song ofthe mountain whipporwill.  Rest, THUNDEii cloto, she said,  Upon your gory bed,  Nor let a tear of mine  Awake one tear of thine,—  For never should a warrior's brow  Be wot with such as rain down now !  A wife—and I may weep  Above my husband's sleep ;  A wife, no more ! and I  May like a palo face cry;  For he was brave—the Thunder Cloud,   .  When howled the war-song, shrill and loud.  'Twason his bosom warm  I hid me safe from harm ;  And \yKen the hum and fight,  Were o'er, at dear midnight,  The tempest of his wrath sunk low,  He lov'd his Namcoke so.  That bosom now is cold;  The ice upon it rolled  No tears can thaw away;  I'll cry till break of day,  Brave Thunder Cloud of Natchez kings,  Thy death so broke my poor heart strings.  Thy voice was terrible  Above the battle,yell—  Yet when to me it spoke  Tho tones of love awoke,  Like cooing birds in spring's green tree  Those very birds have envied mc!  Am  Far offi in Islands green,  My spirit chief is seen,  As on his war horse brave  He rides beyond this grave;  maybe, when my tears aro dry,  I'll go and gaze upon his eye.  I'll dig mc down to where  His mighty relics nre,  Facing the rising sun:  My franiic task is done—  And who will now the sods return,  That I may share my warrior's urn I  Next morn tho hunters passed again that way,  And covered back the loosened henp of clay,  Where calmly rest—united and forever—  Two faithful hearts nor timo nor death could sever!  A gay and noble youth, from Paris, came  To wander o'er these hills without a name,  Wild with the joy tho glorious forest gave  To those long cloistered, on the level wave  Where yonder mounds slill brave the waste of years,  Piles of ihe dead ! where human hopes and fears,  Long since entombed, arc now forgot by nil,—  Once rose the shout of song and merry festival I  For ihere a cily spread its ample domes,  And the proud Natchez Sachems had their homes.  Here came tho youthful warrior of France—  Came to to be conquered by a single glance,—  For, in tho eye of one sequestered there,  Was wondrous witchery—and she was fair,  But had a name no heathen Grcok could spell,  So Louis named her Annette—just as well I  In her mild eye, the pride of Atzec shone,  The blood of famous Ineas was her own;  And yet, in one short hour, her maiden heart  Was linked lo Louis, never more to part.  Oft at the night full she would look afar,  ( The suns and moons supposed she saw a star;) j  But 'twas no star she sought amid the gloom;  She wished lo see her lover's dashing plume,  As on his Spanish horse, through brake and glen,  Ho held his way to see Annette again.  One night an awful silence hung around,  No warrior in that city could be found,  And palo Annette, with straining eyes, looked out  In dread of something—death, or bloody rout.  Still rolled tho hours, till tire sweet morning star  Looked from Iho East—alas I it looked on war I  She heard a cannon thunder—then another—  Where is her lover! where her father, brother?  Gun after gun in wild disorder broke,  Yet mournfully tho solemn echoes spoke,  As those at sea that pierce ilio  toad's dull ear  HIS 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/404	404	405.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/405.jp2

NOTES.  '■ Dim shadows from old mounds and temples cast"  It is a fact, well known to every antiquarian, that the entire  Vale of the Mississippi abounds with the remains of mounds  and Indian fortifications. From the stylo of these remains a  far higher degree of civilization is indicated than has been found  among any ofthe North American Indians, now in existence.  It is not improbable that emigrations from Mexico, long before  theSpanish conquest, might have been effected, peoplingTcxos  and the banks of tho Mississippi with small colonies of the  highly cultivated Atzecs, and monumental Indians.  " The Children of the Sun," a/c.        '  Tradition relates that the Natchez Indians were So especially sun-worshippers or "children of the sun," that the warriors  were called " Suns," and the wives of the warriors or chiefs  were called " Moons."    This was truly oriental and poetic.  " They worshipped, loo, in solemn temple's shade."  There was a tradition extant within the memory of some of  the oldest inhabitants of Natchez that the Natchez Indians had  a temple for the worship ofthe sun, within the present, limits of  the city.    It was said that the foundation ofthe ancient Catholic church covered, or was near, the site of the temple of the  sun.    Col. Anthony Campbell, lately deceased, had acquired  considerable evidence on this subject; which was entirely satisfactory to his mind.  " High o'er the graven altar proudly shone  The Sun God, flaming on his earthly throne,  Such fires as Zoroaster," tf-c.  The ceremonials of the Sun worship; as practised by the  Peruvian Incas, and by the more civilized tribes of South  America, were splendid nnd imposing. There is no more difficulty in ascribing the origin ofthe aboriginal American San  or fire worship to Phoenicia, than there is in ascribing the  origin ofthe highly civilized tribes that overspread continent  at the time of its discovery, to Phoemicia, through the Phoenician colony that founded Carthage. The stupendous remain;  of Palenque, tho long forgotten city of South America, arc indisputably ofthe Phoenician or Carthagenian style of architecture.  " The Incas' litany so wildly sweet. "  The music of the natives of Mexico, in their public worship, was astonishingly wild, yet harmonious. In the- worship  of the god of war, it was, says Bernal Diaz, the Spanish historian of the invasion of Cortez, terrible beyond "descriptioni  In the sun worship, it was of a more pleasing character.  " Since Rosalie's stem frowning ramparts stood."  It is not entirely certain that the first French fort in this  vicinity was called Rosalie, or that it stood on the site of  the ruins of the old fortification that is now gradually  wasting from the summit of the bluff, and washing into the  river, by every powerful rain. The name, Rosalie, is romantic enough to have originated with M. Robert Cavelier de U  Salle, who left France in 1G84, with a squadron of four ship-  ommanded by Capt. Beaujeu, for ihe purpose of foundinga  new settlement on the bonks of the Mississippi.  " To sec this glorious land—its Eden flowers.

There arc many fragments of  traditions still extant, respecting the loves of the Indian  moons, with these gay colony-founders.  " And heard an Indian widow's lone lament."  The fact here narrated is authentic; but it was not a widow  • if ihe Natchez tribe, who thus dug down  to the remains of  her chief, and died upon them, to secure a burial with him.  " Where yonder mounds stilt liruve the waste of years. "  Reference is here made to tho interesting and well-preserved mounds near Sclscrtown, in  this county, about sixteen  miles from Natchez.  " For there a city spread its ample, domes. "  It is but reasonable to conclude that a number of mounds  indicate the site of a city, as these mounds were, undoubtedly,  both places of burial for the dead, and mural altars, where sacrifices by fire were offered, either lo tho deities, or to the manes  of the dead. The mounds appear lo be raised by the successive layers of the dead, covered deeply over, making a plateau  for another layer, nnd thus for another. They wero truly the  sacretl places, or urns, of ihe Indians, who had a high reverence for ihe bones and dust of their fathers.  "('nine to tic conquered by a. siniilc glance."  There is a tradition, received by the venerable John Hutch-  ins,  Esq., of this vicinity, from his father,  Col. Anthony  Hutching, who received it from some of the Natchez Indians  themselves, that a young Indian maiden, in love with a gay  yuan.;' Frenchman in the fort, sought means to cause a failure in the grand expedition concerted for iho destruction of  tho French garrison by the Natchez and Choctaw Indians.  Her plan to ruin the concert between the two tribes did not  answer tho end which she intended; for when the Natchez  had drawn tho last slick, or arrow, from tho bundle, which  indicated the concerted time of attack by both tribes, they advanced to the attack alone, and effected the slaughter.  When  the Choctnwscamo to the foray, they were surprised that the  Natchez were beforehand with them, and both accused the  . other, alternately, with treachery or cowardice.    A quarrel  arose respecting the division of plunder, and ihe two tribes  fought with each other until almost the entire tribe of the  Natchez was exterminated.    The unhappy moon, who had  thus been the indirect cause of Ihe slaughter of her father  and In-other, as well as most of her tribo who had first murdered her lover, was seized with melancholy, and went and  drowned herself in a lake.

This disappointment, added to the sorrows of bis  whole career in these regions, so different from his fate oa  tho n-olden coast of Peru, and a defiance sent him by a  tribe of Indians near Natchez, completed the work of melancholy, and broke the heart of Do Soto. He fell a prey lo a  monal disorder; and to conceal the body of the dauntless as-  soci iteof Pizarro, the governor of Cuba and ihe first explo-  n r of these south-western regions, "the corpse, wrapped in a  mile and in the silliness of midnight, was silently sunk in  the Mississippi," Thus tho discoverer "of the Mississippi  slept beneath its waters.

The latter were numerous, and some of them important. They were produced partly by committees which the  Association had appointed for the purpose, nnd partly by the  labors of individuals. Among the improvements, I may  mention modes of increasing the facility of working iron;—  the comparative influence on it by the hot and cold blast.  Improvements in the telegraph, the safety lamp, in oplical  lenses, and in ihe mode of adapting spectacles to the eyes. *  Ii has been ascertained to the satisfaction of the learned,  that the diamond, on bi ing cut for lenses, often becomes  opaque, whence it is inferred that it must be removed from  the mineral to the vegetable kingdom. Great advance-shave  been made in electricity and in geology. As for chemistry,  ihe old foundations are being removed, and I hope we shall  find new ones substituted; but whether they will last longer  lhan those displnci d. is matter of great uncertainty.  Among tbi discoverii s of chemistry, there is one of great  importance to our country. Mr. Crane stated that ho had  succeeded in sun him.' iron by anthracite coal. By means of  a cupola furnace, he urged a stream of hot air on the anthracite, which was all that was necessary to produce that com-  bustion of the coal requisite for the reduction of the ore.

The view of so many intellectual  heads, and tho recollection of their achievements, compared  with Ihe simplicity of their maimers, chess, and conversation,  was deeply interesting. The animation displayed in their  countenances and movements passed from one to the other,  and caused a degree of excitement through the whole, which  was communicated lo the inhabitants, nnd kept the city in a  state of extraordinary and agreeable commotion.

His sermon was on ministerial character nnd graces.  We remember ihat every sentence in that sermon flowed like  sublimated spirit. Condensed—stripped of verbiage—chastened to naked simplicity and directness of thought, the discourse was more an influence lhan a form. We recollect  ihat he compared classical ornaments, in an oration for God,  to the "stars on a winter's nighl—clear, but oh, how cold!"   Il was near the close of the sermon that  we felt and witnessed the power of the speaker. The subject had swelled to an awful importance in his hands; he had  brought ihe ministers of the sanctuary before the Shekinah;  he summoned them to the altar that darted ils lightnings on  Dathan nndAln'ram; and bade them beware that they had  todo with a Spirit.   All at once ho seemed entranced—gazed  m vacancy—and exclaimed with the energy of a Demosthenes—Bui, what form is that I see, more dee-ply scarred  with thunder lhan the rest—around whom a thousand wretch-  1 beings crowd with furious gestures and agonizing imprecations!

Tho Nantucket Inquirer contains an account of an ancient  city on the coast of Peru, which, with all its inhabitants had  been buried by some volcanic or other convulsion of nature,  and which has been but recently re-discovered.   Tho informa  tion is derived from Capt. B. Ray of Nantucket, commander  ofthe ship Logan, lately arrived at New Bcdfoid from tha  South Seas.  Ho states.thal on touching at the port of Guarmcy, Trtisillo,  which is in about 10 degress of south latitude, he found the inhabitants engaged in excavating the remains of a subteranenn  city, which they had recently discovered in their immediate  vicinity. He visited ihe spot whilst Ihe excavations were proceeding, and examined those portions of ihe ruins and reiki  which had been explored. From tho situation in which human mummies were found, (here appeared to be no doubt, thai  they, like the inhabitants of Herculaneum and Pompeii in  Europe, had been overwhelmed in ono common death and oblivion whilst in the midst of their ordinary avocations. Il don  not appear from Capt. Ray's statement that any clue has bcea  found to the date ofthe awful event, but the bodies were in a  wonderful state of preservation ; the hair, the nails and integuments remaining entire as in life, and tho muscular structure  bul little shrunk, though perfectly exsiccated—ihe effects, possibly of the nitrous properties of the circumjacent soil. The  mummy of one man was found in an erect position, nnd from  pieces of money which were found near him, it may be inferred that ibis ancient people were not irreconcilably hostile lo  a specie currency.—From some evidence, which is not stated,  the conjecture is given that the population of this unknown  city must have amounted to 30,000 souls.  The walls of some of ihe edifices remain standing, and in  one of the explored houses, Captain Ray saw ihe body ofa  woman in a silting posture, who, when overwhelmed in liic  solemn hour of destruction, appeared to have been engaged in  weaving, for the implements of that avocation were around  her, and were in her skeleton hands. A small piece of clot),,  partly woven, was spread before her upon a reed frame; in  one hand she held a sharp spindle or bodkin, eight or ten  inches in length, in which was wound a quantity of line cotton  thread of light brown colour; and parcels of cotton and win-  ted yams of various colours, wero also lyingncar her. She  tppearsto have been wrapped in a loose cotton robe% cuitablo  to the warmth ofthe climate. Capt. Ray procured the iinfin-  islu tl fabric on which she bad been engaged, together with her  spindle, and several specimens of her threads. It appears to  have been a work- of ingenious ornament, like u sampler, or  table rug, for tho frame was eight inches square, and she  had completed about one half of her industrious task, when her  hands lost their cunning in tho sudden grasp of a dreadful I  death. We may possibly hereafter learn An (her particular!  ol ibis interesting discovery; further excavations may develop)  some indications ofthe ago and name ofthis buried city, and  of tho character and social condition of its entombed inhabitants.

A FORENSIC ESSAY  In ihe Affirmative ofthe question, "Are the claims of the Mathemailca to pre  domtnunco in c-eii.-r.il Education, grcaicr lhan ihe claims of the Ancient Clos  ales!" Read before tho Jefferson College Lyceum, 3d Juno, 1837. HyC. 0  I'iiiisiiey, A. St., Professor of Slalhematlcs and Civil Englnoerlug, in Jeffersoi  College.  To vindicate the claims of mathematical science, is to defend the physical, intellectual and moral amelioration of human society. Its history is that of substantial improvement,  and its hoary ago entitles to profound veneration. It needs  no labored commendation, much less from a tyro in its acquis!  tion. Sounding epithets are ils slander;—they serve hill lo  obscure the lustre of its value. The traveller, Upon iho burning desert, needs not be told of the sweetness of cooling waters.  As water is to the thirsting pilgrim, so is the deep draught  from the mathematics, to tho mind that thirsts fur deeper  knowledge. To attract attention, then, to some of its uses,  not to eulogise, shall be the purpose ofthe present essay.  There can be hut two leading objects of correct education;  namely, to prepare man for usefulness in the present, and  happiness in a future existence. And fortunate is it thai  such is the constitution of human character, and the order ol  nature, that the process which best secures the former will,  inevitably, lead to the latter.  We find ourselves placed among myriads of similar beings,  —our wants, our interest, and our destiny linked with theirs.  The littu'ss ol' our frame lor vigorous action, and the quenchless thirst of our minds alter knowledge, evince the high dominion man was intended to hold over subordinate creation,  nnd the empire his own intellect should sustain in self-sub-  juration and ihe happiness of bis spi cies. Menco is derived  the first object of correct education. From Divine Revelation and the phenomena of mind, we learn its immortality;  from holy Scripture, an 1 the analogy of nature, we are  taught upon what ils future weal or woe is dependant. Here  we derive the second objecl of correct education.  Having thus promised our views of the purposes of proper  education, and quoted the sources whence those views are derived, we shall endeavor to show how these objects may best  be secured. And first; what species of education will render  man most useful lo himself and to his fellow-man? We unhesitatingly answer, as we conscientiously believe, Mathematical science, pure and applied.  As a discipline of the mind, it has incomparably the advantage of every other study. Ils principles are independent  of material existence, and upon them is based tho stupendous  fabric of nature. It was by mathematic laws the ETERNAL  wrought when the universe sprang into being; and when the  morning stars sang together, it was but the silent—august  harmony of their motion. And while man, the masler-picce  of creation,—a god in miniature, has emulated his Father in  the creation of systems, time has prostrated anil scattered  nearly every theory of philosophy, leaving unscathed—untouched, the science of Mathematics.  As a discipline to the mind, it should commence! with the  first buddings of intellection, under the form of arithmetic.  If we mistake not, duality, then plurality, are the first rational perceptions we observe in the inliuit mind: for, to distinguish, among things, implies the existence and the perception  of plurality. From that moment, mathematics should commence its discipline. Every successive reach of childhood  thought can thus be trained and rendered systematic! for the  external world is systematically, and wilh the simplest gradation unfolded; requiring but the present mastor-mind of  teacher or parent to point out the number, relation, combination and urn; as the capacity expands lo admit the idea. Such  a philosophic training would master the fundamental principles of Arithmetic and mathematics, Ion,"; before tho age at  which they are usually commenced; and the subject of discipline would scarce be conscious of having accomplished a  task. Experiment has settled this position, and placed it  beyond contradiction; improvement having, in every case, been  found in the direct ratio of capacity, and the rational jiuins  thus bestowed upon early thoughts.  The next legitimate province of mathematical study, after  the mind has thus been taught to systematise, is in the discipline of tho reasoning powers, in the form of Geometry nnd  Algebra. The synthetic or analytic mode of reasoning is  employed to arrive at or establish every truth, whether in  mathematical or moral reasoning. The former establishes the  truth of a proposition, by commencing upon known and  admitted truths, nnd following the train of undeniable  sequences to the desired result. The latter1 lakes the result,  separates it into its original or simple truths, and examines  the strength of each, and iheir arrangement in establishing  the final result. "The one would prove the principles of a  machine, by putting together to form a whole; tho other by  Inking it to pieces and examining its parts. At the head of  iho first stands Geometry, of the second, Algebra." They  form a system of logic of the most perfect character, since  they present, nt once, iho mode and ils application. It is  learned from its application or not nt nil. No catalogue of  technicals, in explanation of the theory, mystifies this tangible logic. Tho syllogisms of Geometry admit but simples  to prove a compound; not general, to prove particular and  subordinate truths, as in other systems of logic. Its basis is  real, nol hypothetic! So Algebra, in the analysis of truth, as  (leometry in the inductive process, deals in the application,  not tho theory of logic.  The eflect, then, of Geometry, in the discipline of tho mind,  onsisls, first, in perpetuating that habit of systematizing f.oii-  menced in Arithmetic: second, in enabling the mind to hold  suspended a long series of truths, each essential to the result,  till the last be added, and the general truth irresistibly established: third, in teaching the mind to arrange truths in the  order of their necessary sequences, to reject redundancy—to 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/415	415	416.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/416.jp2

The province of Algebra,  not less important, is to analyze every proposition, whether  moral or mathematical, which solicits credence', by such a  process of scrutiny, as at once and forever lo settle its claims.  If any of ils parts be found wauling or fallacious; if their arrangement be found suei) that a sophistical conclusion has been  plausibly drawn, the analysis will delecl and expose the error.  If all iho parts which compose a general truth bo found  present, each genuine, and the conclusion correctly drawn,  and yet the arrangement so confused as to create suspicion,  analysis will point out the correction, and present the whole  In a clearer and more forcible light. * * * It need nol  be further insisted that these influences are the same in moral  as in mathematical reasoning. Without reducing all propositions to formulas, still they can be subjected to mathematical rigor, in the demonstration or the analysis of truth. And in  the admission of truths into the mind, for the formation of principle, the nearer each can be brought to the standard of scrutiny,  pointed out by mathematical logic, the more safely may those  principles be relied upon, and the profound will be all subsequent research. For all other logic is theory without application; such theory "niayerr, observation may deceive, but  demonstration never I"  It has been said that the pure mathematics have their foundation in the nature of things. This position we shall reverse, and say, that lite natures of things have their foundation  in the pure mathematics.  The laws of attraction, an essential properly of material  existence,—the cause of all motion,—are demonstrated to be  deeply, and rigorously mathematical.    Attraction of gravita-  ing upon its bosom. That wind is moved by the principle (f  gravitation just shown to be strictly mathematical. Tlle  lightning obeys the laws of electricity, and the thunder is but  the concussion of the lightning with the neighboring atmosphere, causing a vibration, which decreases in the inverse  ratio of the squares of the dislances from ihe point of concussion. Again: The torrents tumble from the mountain  lop, rush together upon the plain, and in the form of n mighty  river, wind their way across a continent, to find a resting  place in the ocean. Gravity gives to those waters their original  impulse, and ils few simple laws, govern all their meander-  ings, till in the ocean they find their nearest possible approach  to the center. And again ; observe the trembling leaflet, the  morning dew, tho music of an instiument, the symmetry of  the human form, the insect sporting in the evening sun: see  the canopy that overspreads us, the rainbow that spans it, the  falling avalanche, and the awful throes of nature. Now return and analyze each in its order. Tho leaves that quiver  yield to the impulse of the wind, and in every revolution describe a geometric curve, and the wind is moved by gravitation. The tlew drop forms and falls by gravitation, and music  beautifully and deeply mathematical. The bird or the insect upon the air is supported by repulsion, and every stroke  of a microscopic wing, describes the arc of a circle. The  curves that bound the human frame, with the figures described  by the motion of its limbs, may be separated, classified, and  subjected to the most rigid mathematical analysis. The canopy  above us is but the boundary of sight, a sphere of which the  eye is tlie center: and the rainbow, itself the arcs of several  concentric circles, the line joining their common center and  tion, the grandest in its effects, of all its class of properties,!the sun, passes through ihe eye of the observer,—is but tho  commences by reducing inorganic matter to spherical form—'separation of ihe rays of light by refraction, and referable to  a perfect geometrical figure—produced by the tendency of its the mathematic science of optics. The dread avalanche obeys  parts to a common center, Thus, from the ::'.'n drop to theithe impulse of gravity; and the direful earthquake finds ils  ocean, from earth to the heavens—the moon, the stars, the governing laws and its final conqueror, in attraction and re-  suns of a thousand systems, all have assumed their beaiitcousjsistance.

But these are tbelaws of nature, and hence the 1. ws  of God; and the wonder that they cannot err, finds here its  may bo demonstrated a priori, from the following considera-  lions: Grant that there was a time when the creation occurred.

SOUT H - WEST ERN JOURNA 1,  51  matical science 1 Nor does it require so limited an amount of  the knowledge of calculation, as is sometimes asserted. It  has required men ofthe best and quickest mathematical talent,  to avoid the most disastrous confusion in the books of great  business establishments. As nn instance: Sir Wm. Pitt, lord  Chancellor of the British exchequer, employed George At-  wood, ono of the most distinguished mathematicians of his  day, and conferred upon him an office, otherwise sinecure, to  make his yearly financial calculation?. Dr. Franklin say  arithmetic is the "primum mobile, (principal mover,) of all  mundane aflairs, in general, nnd is useful for all sorts and de  grees of men, from the highest to the lowest." Argument  aside, every one knows that an acquaintance with arithmetic,  is absolutely necessary to carry on ones ordinary dealings  with society.  Surveying is the science from which geometry takes its  name, (&gt;--, the earth, and e-Tt'-", to measure,) because it was  first applied to the measurement of lands. Claims to certain  portions of the earth have obtained, from the earliest ages,  among nearly all nations. To ascertain ihe precise boundaries ol thes3 claims, and the exact quantities contained, are  necessary to the order and peace of society. Now the assumption that this science may be learned from a few plain  rules, without understanding their reasons, is entirely gratui  tons, as the attempt is mischievous. Having had oecasion to  examine some of these surveys, which have produced half a  century's litigation, we have found them but strong instances  of what may and dors occur, in almost every instance, where  men attempt lo work by principles they do not understand-  'Tis true that if ns much time be spent in committing rules,  as would master the principles, it will enable some men lo perform the simplest jobs in surveying. Bui lit the slightest difficulty, or even doubt occur, and your men; practical man  must halt at once, or blunder on, lo the loss or ruin of his  employer, and the disgrace of the noble science he professes.  No, it requires all intimate knowledge of both trigonometry  and geometry, and even of the higher branches r,f algebraic  analysis, to examine the correctness of his logarithmic la Mis  and mike an expeditious and accurate surveyor. And to these  must b? ad led some knowledge of Astronomy, before he can  scientifically take the variations of the needle,  But in the mechanic arts, where shall we look for the part  not dependant upon mathematics? In all the gradations of  building, from the cabin or lint to the stately dome of a capitol,  the tribute of praise is due to ibis one prolific source. 'Tis  true that some degree of proficiency may bo attained by patient application, without understanding the scientific principles of a mechanical branch. But how have those principles  originally been applied, and the particular art brought lo its  present perfection ? How, for instance, has a watery element  been compelled to render that very service, which now overcomes the resistance of its wave, and almost annihilates difficulty and distance. The records of time present not half  so magnificent a triumph of art over nature, by the applications of her own principles to herself, as is daily witnessed,  in the proud monument to the memory of Fulton. And the  analysis will sustain the position, that the glory is due to the  mathematics.    Steam is the great moving cause, nnd is refer  able at once lo that branch of mechanical philosophy called  hydrostatics. All the machinery set in motion is but combinations, permutations, and arrangements of the lever, tho  wheel and axl.\ and the pulley, all discussed in mathematical  philosophy. In building, too, every leading triumph of  Strength or permanence, has been the result of vigorous calculation. The brace, the column, tho spire, the arch, the  dome, with all their precise, symmetrical proportions, acknowledged same origin. Now, wliat.thougb theblunderingcopy-  ist may construct an edifice of beauty nfter years of slavish aiid  blind imitation I if a change is to be made, or a new beauly  added, you must go to the man of science. So your mere  practical nrchitect is deprived of nil the mental gratification  of understanding the principles by which he labors; he must  suffer the immense loss of time and material which could be  saved by science. He is shut out from the great world of  improvement, he is debarred from invention, that most gratifying nnd triumphant of human gifts. So, if mental gratification is the object of the mechanist, it is only to be found, in  the scientific application of principles to practice; for there  is certainly something of humiliating degradation in copying  for a lifetime, the workmanship of another.  But the mathematics are not confined lo mechanic arts, in  their application to the useful business of life. All the intercommunication between different pails of our country, and  between different and distant lands, bring ihese laws into essential requisition. To run the line of the most common  road, the surveyor must be called lo tin' undertaking. To  locate such road upon the most eligible grounds,—such as  shall cost ihe least possible amount, approach nearest to n  level, and take the shortest accessible route;—and where all  these are not possible, lo balance judiciously, cost, level, and  distance'—all require the most intricate and perplexing calculations, Indeed, none bul an Engineer possessingn thorough  knowledge of mathematics, is competenl to the undertaking.  And in the construction of a road, his knowledge must still  direct every movement, whilst laborers perform but the manual  par,. Upon the vast ocean, ho-^jwa-, tho triumph of calculation is most magnificent, most iboundless in utility. "That  a man by merely measuring the moon's distance, from a fixed  star, with a little sextant, should tell, within five miles, of his' v  position, upon a boundless water, cannot but appear to np-C  proach the miraculous." A trembling bark, lost in the infinity •*  of its littleness, compared with the clement, uponwhich it ventured, trusted itself to a boisterous Pacific, at San Bias, in Mexico,  to seek a port 80(111 miles distant. A fow bounds of ihe gallant traveller, and the last land-mark sank behind the wave;  yet onward, and still onward she bore, with hula canopy and  its gems or its thunders above; and, ns if in mockery, thesame  deep mirrored canopy beneath.    Upon the bow,  "If pans so small a lltiiier can have,"  there might be seen the pigmy man, who, with bis sextant,  lances at the moon, gives a command, retreats within his little world, and all is safe. Tempests swept and billows dashed,  and the reeling bark sank and rose, and drove at random on  tho wave. Thesky at last appeared, the Utile lord was at his  post with his wand, and again his realm leapt over the sea, In  ghty-nine long days and nights, no land was seen, to cheer or  $■;■,.  h  j-', -   !

The proud conqueror  was no other than Capt. Basil Hall. Yet his victory must  be shared by a host, who have buttled valiantly with ignorance  nnd error; who have laid truth upon truth of mathematic  lore, and applied each to its proper use; one discovered and  proved the motion of the heavenly bodies, and the rotundity  of the earth; another applied the principles of optics, and  made an instrument which would bring the distant near, and  give to it ils proper magnitude; a third invented the sextant;  and 11 thousand others, who brought earth, and sun, and moon,  and stars, under contribution, each addi d an item, till the combined result gave man the glory of circumnavigating earth!

We  allude to astronomy : ami passing by its more obvious advantages, we shall call attention lo ils effects upon the mind.

S3  We shall now take a condensed view of the posilitive vul-lhave been well taught to that age, reading natural science, or  lie of classic study ; then notice some of the objections to the drawing maps with their instruments, or tugging at a knotty  same, and close by a comparison of its effects with those of puzzle in arithmetic, for amusement, or rather for tho pleasure of the mental exercise it produces. And the celebrated  Locke, who understood better the buddings of thought than  any English philosopher, and who only, of all metaphysicians, has demonstrated,—he it was that said, " Into whose  care soever the instruction of children is committed, one thing  is certain, he should be one who thinks Latin and language  the least pari of education."  Again ; as a mental discipline, the study of language fur-  nishes not that species of system,—that gradation of thought,  that architecture of idea, if you please, which will be called  into action in our common reasoning.    It assists not to sift  truth from falsehood, but leaves the mind doubtful of its own  decisions, till the dixit of the instructor has settled the matter.  And when done—and the mind perfectly clear upon a point,  lo what shall the truth or principle bo applied!   "To the  solution of a similar difficulty" forsooth! and. this lo another  and so on—all for the sake of learning the shades of meaning  of a word, or something still more evanescent than a shadow.  ( I thank my stars—mathematics do not deal in shadows, but  in substance—in thought, embodied, chained, TANGIBLE I —  Pardon the digression.) When yourclassic student is brought  lo reason,—to exercise this noble, distinguishing feature of  our nature, to what purpose shall he apply his rules of Latin  prosody, or the conjugation of his Greek irregulars, or any  principle derived from either?    "But," it is answered, "he  will bring to bear the philosophy nnd history ho has quarried  from Iho dust of twenty centuries." My life upon il, he learned  it from a translation; for I have seldom known a student who  did not get a hundred ideas from Itulliu, Gillies, Gibbon nnd  Lempriere, for one from his classic text-book.    Then all tho  argument for classic study, (o introduce us to the  history of  the manners, and customs, laws, politics, etc., of the ancients,  falls to the ground.    But if classic study is no! adapted to  childhood,—does not discipline properly the reasoning powers, nor apply lo  the common business of life, bow shall it  answer our first object of correct education?    The answer is  unavoidable:  it docs not answer it, or does so in a very limited degree.  Matters of taste, as connected with classic study, deserve  a further notice. Wo are persuaded, that correct taste in  English composition, can belter be attained from the aid of  classic literature, than by any other method. But wo ask, in  candor, at what sacrifice? Can it be done in boyhood, when,  it is insisted, the memory is fresh and vigorous? Wc contend  that it cannot; for, as we have shown, the undertaking does  violence to nature; and all things else equal, ihe lad who studies the English Grammar, language and composition—such  as Addison, Steele and Irving,—will write infinitely better at  the end of two years' application, than his mate, who learns  lo hate Latin Grammar, to despise the Greek ( for no student  ever dared to say he liked Greek Grammar,)—to murder the  translation of the Jugurthine war, and read the Anabysis with  translation. Time—a long time—is necessary to conquer  the first impression of antipathy; and then docs he gain tho  first item of utility.    Meanwhile a very competent know-  the mathematics.  Language is but articulate sound, serving for tho interchange of thought; and, of course, those means by which  the attainment of the correct use of language can best be  secured, should have preference to all others. Now we conceive, thai, since the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages,  lie at the root of most modern languages of enlightened na  lions, the philologist, the lexicographer, critic or teacher of  (ho philosophy of language, should study, not partially, hut  thoroughly, these ancient languages. Moreover, observation  and experience have taught me, that the amount of classic  knowledge, attained in the ordinary college course, has gem  rally the effect of making more elegant writers, by givin  precision lo luste and euphony lo sound. The height of per.  fection to which the Greek language attained, the lofty beauty  of its poetry, and the irresistible grandeur of ils eloquence,  give it high claims to the attention of those who seek eminence, in these ornamental departments of literature. In  stances of excellence in poetry or eloquence, without tho aid  of classic learning-, arc far from demonstrating that the latter  would not have materially heightened the former. None  can doubt that many of the most celebrated writers owed  their distinction, almost exclusively, to classic learning.  But several objections exist, to the usual course of classic  study, which we imagine cannot be successfully met, and  which have led many worthy and learned men to the most  uncompromising hostility to their study—and here would  we take occasion to disclaim all appeals lo sophistry or elisin-  genuousness, in our objections. Gratitude for the low favors  we ourselves have obtained from this source, would forbid  unfair opposition; therefore, our objections shall bo such as  cool reflection and observation, aside from others' views, have  led us to espouse.  Ami, first, let us bring the classics to the great standard  we have adopted, ill defining the objects of education; name  ly,usefulness in life, and happiness in futurity. Now, in the  discipline of the mind, where attempted very early, the study  of language does violence to naliirc; for it diverts the mind  from the material world aboul it, and directs it to sound! to  the philosophic relation of words to each other! None can  deny that the natural order, in mental development, is to commence with the things which first make impressions upon the  mind. To arrest il then from things, and compel it to study  words, is to pervert the natural order. Compulsion in changing this tendency, reason would tench us, would produce disgust for the new; the subject of discipline then hastes the latter, and is compelled to neglect the former, and lose the precious moments when tho "high seal of,character is set."  And experience corroborates reason; for, out of some hundred lads, students of Latin and Greek, from ten years of age,  wo have not met one, at tho age of twelve, who has learned  to like either; and wo appeal to the recollection of our worthy opponent, or to the oldest, to say that he has often seen  boys, at that age, studying their Latin and Greek for amusement.    Now nothing is more common, than to seo lads who|  i,  eKii  V  \  i ;v|  ;.'.

But if classic learning lead not t|le  mind toward morality or Christianity,—if it have no refer-  ence to a future existence, but n ruincus and almost denning  influence in driving it to a contrary extreme, it has failed lo  answer ihe second object of correct education, It hasahecdj  been shown, that it almost entirely failed of the fiist: thcie.  fore its claims are last and least to attention.  Let no one inquire, nt this late day, whal shall be the tub.  stitule for classic learning. The longest life of hcnlih n;d  compile nee, with every advantage of genius and instruction,  is not sufficient to muster half the branches of useful Icamintr,  The world of infinite beauty is around us; and the laws by  which all its pulls and appendages, exist and move, and arc  adapted to the uses of man, furnish a host of sciences, nil  contending for the vacancy created by the resignation of su-  perannuated classics. These sciences, we lave pioved,ate  adapted to the natural development of mind ; lo the thcrcugh  discipline of the reasoning powers; and ramify into all the  business of life: hence they best answer the first object of  correct education. They lead the mind from beauty to beauty, from height to height, from magnificence to magnificence;  from stupendous to omnipotent power and grandeur; to see  the dimiuutiveness of man, and his utter dependence upon  and allegiance lo God, They answer, then, to the second  great object of man's existence; therefore, their claims lo attention, acknowledge no parallel,—they should be first, and  last, and greatest.  ledge of the English language might have brcn mastered, instantly abandoned; for what shall a man accept in exchange  which is yet to be accomplished by the Latinist; and the  student would thus be prepared to enter upon ihe active du  ties of manhood, at a much earlier period. Let us repeat  emphatically, thai Ihe correct use of every word in Ihe English language, can be lea rncd without a knowledge of any other  language; though we confess, that lo trace ihe reasons and  origin of a particular application,—generally n useless task,  a knowledge of several languages may be requisite. Since,  then, a high degree of taste is but ornament, not positive and  essential utility, let it be preceded by Utility—by the sciences  which apply lo the business of life; and let it be added, if  time bo found, for a high degree of ornament.  There are higher objections to classic study, when arraigned upon the second great business of education. Taste—  and sentiment, nnd oven intellectual might, if necessary, must  be sacrificed, when they militate against or endanger man's  eternal destiny. Who dares doubt, that three or four years',  or half a score's training and drilling of ihe mind, to the love  of pagan literature—lo a taste for the lascivious poetry of an  abandoned and dissipated Horace; to admire the character of  a brutal Achilles or "perfidious jEneas"; who dares deny,  ihat to study and admire the works of those who deify treacherous, bloody mortals, stones, and even shadows, in volumes  of silly, disgusting absurdity,—will teach man by degrees,  insidious and unnoticed, lo degrade—then forget tho God  who created him ? to cherish the fiendish passions a debauched poet lias sung? If any one doubts it, he has not watched  the morals, and learned the character ofthe thousand subjects  of college honors, in his own day. Take the opinion ol one  of the most distinguished scholars, classic and philosophic,  our country can afford; one who has been half u century  watching the signs of the times, mourning over human depravity, and seeking out the strongholds of vice. " 1 remember," says he, -no instance of distinguished moral worth,  that owetl not its existence to the domestic influence of parental piety, which had so deeply imbued the mind with moral  sentiment, or so fully developed the moral powers, as to place  the virtuous youth beyond the contaminating influence of ihe  polluted fountains of Grecian and Roman literature. *    *   *  "So commonly have all the rank vices of the age- been found  most luxuriant among the educated classes, that philosophers,  for the last century, have often been employed in inquiring  into the causes of this great discrepancy. They have generally agreed, that it is owing, in a great measure, to the dominion of pagan literature, mythology and morality, necessary  to college honors. There is so much more of Grecian and  Roman ambition, cruelty, debauchery, perfidy, rapine, general licentiousness and lewdness, in an academic course, than  of the Christian virtues and morality, that most theorists on  the moral culture of the learned world, ascribe to this the  delinquencies of the age."  We acknowledge that a vast change, to moral advantage,  might be made by a judicious substitution of works less exceptionable. But the udvocates of classic literature insist,  that Horace and Homer arc the best models of taste, and  therefore must be retained, and their influence must follow.

We have  been gravely told, that the pursuit of classical learning, is a  useless wasle of time; that it is calculated lo contract the  mind, by a too minute attention to the study of words, which  ought to be directed to ideas, of which words are merely the  vehicles ; and that it has a tendency to pervert the taste, corrupt the morals, and deprave the heart. These are serious  and weighty charges; and, could they be substantiated, would  go far towards justifying the clamor which has been raised  against the dead languages, as they are called. This sentiment, sanctioned by so high authority, has been echoed by  thousands, who have no adequate knowledge of that which  they thus gratuitously condemn. A blind man judging of  colors, or a deaf man, of the harmony of sounds, would be  just as rational, as an ignoramus, or superficial sciolist, deciding on the merits of the great original writers of Greece and  Home, which arc as far beyond his comprehension, as they  are above his censure. The vulgar prejudice, indeed, seems  to regard Latin and Greek as a kind of black letter, or mysterious something, having no connection with the system 01  nature, or human affairs, as unintelligible and as useless as  Egyptian hieroglyphics, as if the classics were studied merely for the sake of the form, or sound of the letters, and not  for the stores of taste, knowledge, and sentiment they contain.  These modern Vandals, would wage a war of extermination  against the Latin and Greek authors, the finest monuments  that remain of ancient genius, which, like the Venus of Praxiteles, and the Apollo Belvidcre, still stand forth to the admiration of the world, as models, in their kind, of unrivalled  excellence.  Suppose the classics discarded from our systems of education, and again banished to the; cloisters of monks and schoolmen ; or preserved, like other relics of antiquity, only in the  cabinets of the curious, what shall we substitute in their Stead?  Shall they be entirely superseded by the mathematics and  natural philosophy ?    Far be it from us to depreciate the exact  sciences.    Their utility, both from the intellectual discipline  which they furnish, and their various and important applications to the every day practical business of life, has been ably  portrayed by the learned gentleman who preceded mo in this  discussion, and are admitted without controversy.    We wish  not to undervalue mathematical and scientific studies.    To  science, indeed, we nre unspeakably indebted.    It has added  infinitely to mini's accommodation, in every department.   The  compass, Ihe telescope, the microscope, the air-pump, the elec  tricul machine, have given to man new faculties, and opened  new worlds to his view.   The lightning-rod of Dr. Franklin  and the safety-lamp of Sir Humphrey Davy, by which thousands of valuable lives have been saved, are prouder trophies  of the triumphs of science, than the pyramids of Egypt, or  all the monuments of Grecian and Roman antiquity.    The  steam-engine alone has accomplished more for the benefit of  mankind, than the united achievements of ancient art and  genius.  For what, then, do we contend, when we maintain that the  sciences should not bo cultivated to tho exclusion, or even the  comparative neglect, of polite literature ?    We maintain that  the sciences should not supersede the belles lettres, as they are  the best foundation on which to erect the lofty superstructure  of science; and that scientific studies should be postponed, until a considerable proficiency has been made in classical learning.    It seems necessary to urge attention to this point, as the  sciences seem to have become nowall the rage with many in our  own country, as they were recently in France ; and Latin and  Greek have been proscribed and banished, as enemies, doubtless to science and religion, from some of our higher seminaries of learning.    Experience, however, that only sure test  of truth, abundantly refutes all the thousand plausible objections, and satirical reflections, about teaching dead languages,  and words, instead of things; and has led, in France, as it  doubtless will, wherever else the attempt may be made to discard classical learning, to an abandonment of the former theory on the subject, and a restoration to the classics of all their  immunities.   It is the dictate of nature, that words should be  studied in childhood. At how early an age, do we learn, almost  as by instinct, our mother tongue!   Subjects requiring strong  intellect, should be postponed, until the mind has attained a con.  siderable degree of maturity.    Then words, formed into sentences, their connection, dependence, and relations to one another, may with advantage be considered. These, surely, are things  of importance, and necessary to the Understanding of subjects  ofthe first importance, such as geography, history, &c. Low  much a knowledge of the ancient languages facilitates the understanding of our own, may be inferred, when we state, that  the whole number of words in the English language, is estimated al from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and forty thousand.    Of fifteen thousand primitives, more lhan two-  thirds are derived either directly from the Latin, or through  the medium of the French.   The remaining one hundred and  fifteen or twenty thousand are compounds, resolvable mainly  into Latin and Greek, and must be etymologically analyzed,  before they can be thoroughly understood, and their significant  cy, and exact meaning ascertained.    Of what avail is all the  imposing apparatus of science, microscopes, telescopes, electrical machines, air pumps, nay the array of the whole Encyclopaedia, or circle of the arts and sciences, including botany,  mineralogy, us well as entomology, and conchology, or the  science of bugs, worms and shells, wilh the addition, if you  please, of phrenology, that fashionable modern science, el id  omne. genus,—of what avail, I say,are all these to a lad twelve  or fourteen years old, when he cannot comprehend even the  nomenclature, the very terms of the arts and sciences, which,  unfortunately, are borrowed, almost without exception, from  the Latin and Greek languages?    We are aware, that the  attempt has been made to bring down the language of science  to the comprehension of infants; but we fear this mode of instruction, to the exclusion of the good old classical, is extremely deceptive.    This Encyclopaedia kind of education, may  indeed gratify parents with an idea of the wonderful profi-  iency of their children, but cannot, we humbly conceive, be  productive of any solid improvement.    To the acquisition of  any really valuable attainment in science, masculine powers of  mind, and maturity of judgment, are indispensably requisite.

It were superfluous lo dwell on the improvement of all ihe  mental faculties, except perhaps those of mere calculation,—  of the memory, taste, imagination, judgment, discrimination,  the development and expansion, in fine, of all the intellectual  powers, consequent on the study of the classics, commenced  in early life, and continued through many successive years.  The study of Latin and Greek would constitute a valuable  part of education, though they were applied to no practical  use whatever, hut were viewed merely as a means of mental  discipline.    The close attention and constant effort, required  in parsing and construing a diflicull author, is an exercise, like  ihat of mathematical studies, well calculated to strengthen  the mind, and lo impart an exact and correct mode of reasoning.    The mind, accustomed to the study of grammar, to the  accurate analysis of single  words, and of words in connexion, acquires habits of order and systematic arrangement, and  learns to regard every subject with clearness and discrimination. Were only English authors read,the very facility of the  lesson, would cause it to be carelessly studied, would lead to  habits of indolence and inattention, and ultimately to intellectual sloth and imbecility.    Those who have observed, in a  large school, the comparative progress of Students engaged in  prosecuting the ancient languages, and those who  were con-  lined to mathematical and English studies, will be prepared  fully to appreciate tho force of this argument.    Experience  has incontestibly demonstrated, that classical students make  more rapid and thorough proficiency ill every branch of learning.    The great abundance of trash, in the shape of newspapers, magazines, novels, doggerel rhymes, etc., which issue  from the press, at the present day, seems to require an antidote to prevent an entire depravation of ihe public taste, and,  it is to be feared also, a corruption of tho public morals. What  antidote to the grow ing evil, would be so effectual, as the perusal of ancient aulhoi'sof sterling worth and   Indisputable excellence!  But Latin and Greek arc worthy of being studied, not  only as a means of intellectual disciplino, but on account of  their intrinsic excellence. These languages, strange as it  may seem, far surpass, in dignity, harmony, and expressive  ness, all the modern, however they may have been improve,  by learned academies, and adorned by the genius of illustri  ous writers. Both Latin and Greek are remarkable for ma  jesly and melody. Like the ancient architecture, statuary,  and painting, they present models of all that is beautiful,  graceful and magnificent. That language is expressive of  national character, tho faithful minor of a nation's mind, may  be seen by a reference lo modern nations. The lively conversational dialect of tho French, the grave and stately Spanish, the soft and voluptuous Italian, the harsh and guttural  sounds of the north of Europe, of the Russians and Dutch,  aptly reflect the characters of those respective nations. The  languages of tho Greek's and Romans are, truly, like themselves : the Latin, grave and majestic, the Greek, copious and  nervous, eloquent and commanding, They embody, and, as  it were, embalm the genius and disposition of those highly  polished and enlightened nations.    How delightful to con-  verso with Socrates and Plato, with Cicero and Seneca, with  the good and the wise of ancient days, in their own languages-  to walk wilh Plato in the grove of Academus, or amid the  shades of the Lyceum, to listen to the voice of Aristotle, (hat  masterspirit, whose philosophy so long held undisputed swav  over the minds of men ! The Latin writers, says an eloquent  author, display a happy selection of words, a beautiful struc.  ture of phrase, a transparency of style, a precision by which  they communicate the strongest sentiment in the directed  form : indeed, every thing that appertains to the most finished  style of composition. It is the appropriate praise of the best  Roman writers, that they scarcely present one idle, or exerts-  cent sound ; that they continually convey their meaning in  the choicest words. Their lines dwell upon our memory;  their sentences have the force of maxims; every part vigorous,  and seldom any thing that can be altered but for the worse.  The Roman historians are the best that ever existed. The  dramatic merit and eloquence of Livy, the rich and sombre  pencil of Tacitus, all ages of the world admire, but no historian of any other country has been able to rival.  What is here asserted of the Roman language, may, wilh  more justice, be applied lo the Greek, which was indeed the  archetype of the Latin, and comformable to the transcendent  nd universal genius of tho people who spoke it, being from  its flexibility and expressiveness adopted lo every subject nnd  every form of writing. It is at once copious and exact, harmonious and maji stic, elegant and commanding, Who would  not desire to become acquainted with tho language in which  Homer's nnd Pindar's fancy soared, Euclid reasoned, and Demosthenes poured forth that lone nl of "resistless eloquence  which wielded at will the fierce democracy" of Athens, "shook  the arsenal ami fulmined over Greece to Mncedon and Ar-  laxerxes' throne?'' It is unnecessary to dilate on the beauties ,  of the Greek poets. What can equal the tenderness of Euripides, the faultless elegance of Sophocles, the, wild grandeur  and unearthly sublimity of iEschylus, the comic humor and  naivclte of Aristophanes, the unaffected moral simplicity of  Theocritus, Bion anil Moschus? In historic composition,  Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon havo been the mode-Is  of all succeeding historians. What shall wo say of Longiniis.  who is himself "ihe great sublime he draws;" of the divine  Plato, and his disciple the learned Stagyrite, the father of  rhetoric? To the Greek and Latin writers, collectively, wo  may apply the remark of \)r. Leallie, "They relish them  most, who understand them best, and none affect to despise  them but suchasure ignorant of their value."  During tho dark ages, that twilight of the world, a glimmering light, in striking contrast wilh the surrounding darkness, was still reflected from the monasteries, nt that lime tlio  sole depositories of ancient learning, and tended to preserve  science and literature from utter extinction. To the zeal ami  indefatigable industry of the revivers of learning, we arc indebted for rescuing from comparative oblivion, and rendering  accessible to all, the most valuable remains of antiquity, th"  Grecian and Roman authors. In the fifteenth century, tlio  mind awoke from ils slumber of ages, and threw off tho  shackles of ignorance nnd superstition, by which it had been  so long fettered.

Another strong argument in favor of classical studies is  derived from llic- influence which they have exerted on the  literature of modern nations, a reference lo whose history  will clearly show that literature has ever flourished or declined, precisely in proportion as ancient learning has been  cultivated, or neglected. The Augustan period of French  literature was undoubtedly the age of Louis I-lib, when the  Study of the classics was prosecuted will, the greatest zeal  publican ages of Greece and Rome afford the purest models and success.

As they read the spirit-stirring incidents of  their wonderful story, they will learn to glow with the enthusiasm of valor and patriotism, and to emulate, in their conduct, all that is noble, generous and magnanimous, They  catch by sympathy the virtues mid graces of which they read;  they read the beautiful description, anil are led to imitate the excellencies which they admire and revere.

But it will be said why spend four or five years in studying the originals, when the same advantage may be derived  from the perusal of translations!

H is the highest  praise of lUulk-re, Racine and Corneille, that they have successfully imitated and rivalled Aristophanes, Euripides and  Sophocles. Since Polytechnic schools, which, in a great  measure dispense with the classics, have come into vogue,  what writers has France produced at all comparable to the great  writers above mentioned? I las there nut been a great declension, even since the age of Voltaire? The same remarks which  have been made in regard to French, might be shown to be equally applicable to Spanish, Portugucseand Italian literature.

But on this great work his reputation, as a  Christian Moralist and Philosopher, will rest in fiitur,-  liinc.  An elementary treatise of practical morals, such as Christians of every denomination, and all good men, would unite to  approve, must be the work of one who is not the slave of party  in religion or politics, but ihe disciple of truth. As a moral  teacher, this writer professes to draw his authorities from the  sacred scriptures, from the law of the land, and from the illtis  trations, amplifications, and deductions ofthe great masters ol  reason and argument, who have adorned the annals of man  kind, both in ancient and modem times. The work is intend  t .1 particularly for the young; but it may, I think, be read with  profit by persons of all ages. Whatever else we cease lo study  of ornament or pleasure, the science of good morals is appropriate ,o every age and condition of life.  This volume will allract the attention ofthe editors and conductors of the principal Literary and Religious Journals ol  iho United States. They are able to scan its merits, and to doted its faults in the spirit of liberal and candid criticism, 1, is  their vocation. A book designed to convey the principles of  action to the citizens of this great and increasing Republic of  States, cannot be neglected by tho learned without a manifest  fiiilure in duty. I wish merely to ask the attention ofthe reading community to the work for its own merits, and to commend it lo their patronage for the benefit mid encouragement  of its learned and modest author. Letters are to be fostered,  and can flourish only in a rich soil. Wealth owes to them a  deserved tribute ; and I add with pleasure, for the honor of my  country, thnt while Rome boasted of but one Mascenas, we can  point thrin out in every city,  Il is known lo scholars, that the greatest and best men of  all ages, have delighted to form theories of morals, and to  found on thorn schools of instruction with which to perpetuate  llieir own names. Generally, they agreed to recommend virtue as the only true source of felicity. Whatever were their  errors in speculation, their practice was conformable to the  precepts oftruth, however they differed in the grounds of mor  al obligation. Socrates, the chit f ofthe ancient philosophers,  maintained, that an action lobe gootl must be both useful and  honorable; while Plato, his favorite pupil, made virtue to consist in self government and a well balanced mind. (hie philosopher contended, that virtue consisted in practical habits; and  another, in just sentiments and reasonable judgments. Accordingly thoStoics, perfect rectitude was comprised in living ac  cording to nature, and in bestowing upon every object ihe precise degreo ofattention it deserved, according to the standard ol  its worth in the natural scale of things. The primary objects  of natural desire consisted, according to Epicurus, in bodily  pleasure and pain, and in nothing else. '' Oprcre'laram beate  Vivendi, et apertam, et simplicem, el directum viam ! cum enini  certe nihil bouiini possit melius esse, quam vacarc onini dolore  el molcstia, porfruique maximis et animi et corporis volupteti-  bus." Cic. De Finibus. I. 18. Virtue was not to be pursued  lor its own sake, but only as it tended to prevent pain, and to  procure ease and pleasure.    And yet Epicurus believed, that  tho best and most perfect pleasure was to be derived from the  practice of truth and virtuei  The following extrael from tho chapter of "Preliminary  Principles and Discussions,'' will servo as a specimen ofthe  style ofthis work, and will show the respect anil diligence  wilh which the author has consulted the writings of eminent  moralists of modern limes.  "Nor has this diversity of sentiment on the theory of morals  been confined  lo the ancient philosophers.    Modern writers  have not concurred in their views en the theoretical pari of  the subject.    Tho opinion of Dr. Samuel Clarke is, ihat moral  obligation is lobe referred to the eternal and necessary differences of things ; and Ik- makes virtue lo consist in acting suitably to the different relations in which we stand.    Wollaston's  theory is, that moral good and evil consist in a conformity or  disagreement wilh truth, in trealingevery thing as being what  it is.    Lord Shaftsbury makes virtue to consist in maintaining  a proper balance ofthe alii ctions, and in allowing no passion  logo boyond its proper sphere.   Dr. Palcy teaches 1 bat it is the  utility of any action alone, which constitutes the obligation  of  it.     I Ir. Adam Smith resolves moral obligation into propriety, arising from feelings of sympathy.     I )r. Bush considers Ihe  communicated will of God the grand exposition of human duty; while Dymondsays, that ibis will not merely declares the  distinction between right antl wrong in regard lo moral conduct,  but also is itself tin' constituting cause of moral good and evil.  The immutable principles ol morality necessarily result, says  Dr. Appleton, from the natureof things, and from the relations  which they have to one another.    As God is the author of all  things, the relations subsisting between llicm may be considered as depend ing on him.    But while objects continue in all re-  spects as they are, no change can he produced in llieir relations.  It is absurd, continues he, to ascribe to  Deity the power of  changing vice into virtue, or virtue info vice.  ]{ig bt and w rong,  says Dr. Price, denote what actions are.    Now, whatever any  thing is. that it is, not by will, or decree, or power, bin by nature  and necessity.   Again, the natun s of things being immutable,  whatever wo suppose the natures of actions (o be, that they  must be immutably,    If they are indifferent, their indifference  is itsell'ininiutable.    The same is lo be said of right and wrong-,  moral geiod and evil, as far as they express real characters of  actions.    They must immutably and necessarily belong to  those actions of which they are truly affirmed.    "God hath  given us," says Bishop Butler, " a moral faculty, by which  we distinguish between actions, and approve of some as virtuous and of good desert, and disapprove others as vicious, and  of ill desert.  This moral discernment," continues he, " implies  a rule of action, and a rule of a very peculiar kind; for it Carrie's in ii authority, and a right of decision : authority, in such  a sense, that we cannot depart from it without being self-condemned  and the dictates ofthis moral faculty, which are by  nature a rule to us, are moreover (he laws of God—laws, in a  sense including sanctions."  The great question in morals relates to the rules of duty.  Every system on this subject, must be founded on some basis  which shall constitute the supreme and ultimate guide. Dr.  Adams has considered this subject with great ability in his  preliminary discourse.    In various -passages  he is highly  til  ■ri  •I i,'  m;  -  I ■ L  '   I. 1  1       'H  '        ''I  I 1  . 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/427	427	428.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/428.jp2

As 1 comes a Christian divine, and philosopher, be adopts as his principle, "that the  conscience of every individual is lo him the supreme and ultimate rule of duly;—but to insure safe decisions, Ihe mind  must be kept free from prejudice and passions, and above all,  it must be guided, regulated, and enlightened." In this, he  follows Bishop Butler, who. among uninspired men, is in the  first class of moral teachers. "Conscience was, says that  writer, placed within to be our proper governor, to direct and  regulate all undue principles and motives of action. It carries  its own authority with it, that it is our natural guide, the guide  assigned us by the Author of our nature."  Some modern writers have adopted the utility of actions  and their expediency, as the criterion of their rectitude and  the supreme standard of obligation. With whatever ingenuity and force they have maintained their hypothesis, it cannot  be denied, that it is liable to mislead, and therefore not a safe  guide of huminconduct. Th sue-:! nil.-, undoubtedly, is to  follow an enlightened conscience, and in all cases to act as we]  should wish others to do to ns in a similar situation, The  study of morals serves to enlighten the conscience, and to  quicken ils sensibility. And where the actions of men are  performed under a sense of accountability to God, and with  an assured belief of a future state, we shall rarely err, either  in belief or action.  Hiving adopted an enlightened conscience ns the rule of  duty. Dr. Adams proceeds to consider.  I. Our relation to God, and the moral duties thence arising.

He  hes e:.lis:ed, in the cause of morals, the authority of genius:  and he has shewn great judgment, as well as industry, in selecting his authorities. It is a work of great labor.

St., ProfoMor of Languages in Jefferson College.  eoNcr.t-nnn.  We have proved the classics useful, first, for the intellect  mil discipline which they furnish; secondly, from their excellence as models of finished composition; thirdly, from their  important connections and applications. We have shown,  that to them wo are indebted for the most valuable part of our  nun literature, and thai this applies equally to the literature  of other modern nations, French, Spanish, Italian, Portu.  gueso, etc.; farther, that as classical learning has been cultivated, or neglected, in the same proportion lias literature over  flourished, or declined j thnt the study of languages is particularly adapted to tho youthful mind; that it is calculated to  expand and improve all the intellectual powers, and to pre  and figurative sense, can they, with any propriety, be applied  to such subjects. Some visionary enthusiasts have indeed  supposed, that moral, if not mental science might be reduced  to mathematical demonstration. But the absurdity of the  attempt to bring the delicate, and almost imperceptible shades  of distinction in moral conduct and mental action to the test  of arithmetical calculation, is a sufficient refutation of their  pretensions. Algebra, with all its infinitesimals, would labor  in vain, amid the abstractions of metaphysics, nnd the difficult  and abstruse problems so often presented to the philosophic  inquirer in ethical science. The exploded logic of the schoolmen, o.' the astrologer's art, employed in similar investigations, would bo just as appropriate, and would produce equally valuable results.  Sentiment, duly cultivated by reading authors who abound  in it, tis tho writers of Greece and Rome, is most powerful in  regulating conduct,    The cultivation of correct sentiment, of  erve among thorn a due equilibrium, not like the mntheinat- upright and manly feeling, is promoted by the study of poetry,  it's, which cultivate some of the mental faculties, nt the expense of others equally as important; and, lastly, that on  own language cannot be fully understood, without a knowledge of the ancient languages.  We design now to trace more particularly the parallel between the classics and mathematics. Much stress is laid on  the value til' mathematical reasoning, ill which it is said,  "truth with resistless demonstration dwells." Its premises  are self-evident, nnd its conclusions irresistible. Where can  wo linil such consummate logic? What can he more clear,  satisfactory, or elegant, than the process by which Euclid  conducts liis reader from the simplest principles to the most  important and valuable deductions? Grant il; hut what have  tin- materials and the mode of reasoning: of the mathemati-  oratory, history, by all, in short, that is comprehended under  the title of Helios Lellres, or polite literature, (the only sure  foundation of which is a knowledge of the ancient classics,)  hut not ut all by the exact sciences, by measurement and calculation. For what have numbers,and lines, squares, circles,  and triangles, to do with the multiform cares, the hopes, and  fears of man ? An exclusively mathematical education, is  rather calculated to contract than enlarge the mind, and certainly has little influence on the taste and imagination. To  show how compatible a profound knowledge of mathematics is with a toial absence of fancy and feeling, we will only  cite the instance of a famous geometrician, who, alter rending  ono of the finest tragedies ever written, exclaimed, "but what  tloes this all prove !    What docs it demonstrate !"    An un-  cian.todo with tho materials and modd of reasoning of the derstanding the most barren of general knowledge, and a  metaphysician and moral philosopher? While tho one is heart quite cold, are sufficient for mere calculation. A man  wholly enipliiyoil-uliout the world of matter, its modifications with the scienceof Newton or La Place, may yet contemplate  and relations, the other considers the world of mind.    The  logic of mathematics is not the logic of actual life. The  mode of reasoning it adopts, is not that which is demanded in  the every day business, and practical duties of man, not applicable lo moral subjects, to Law, Politics, Medicine, Divini-  iv. in which probabilities must bo weighed, and conclusions  deduced, according to the preponderance of evidence. Mathematical certainty can seldom be attained. In mathematics,  where the statements and conclusions admit of no controversy,  the reasoning is all on one side: in other subjects, contrary  arguments may be urged, and much may usually he said on  both sides of a question.  Ethics, the most important of all sciences, have no diagrams, by which to represent rectitude or obliquity of conduct. The machinery of mind, the nice springs of moral  action, cannot he regulated by tho square and compass, by  tile    lil  mil plummet.  In no other than an emblematic  without emotion a sublime moral action, a finished poem, or  an oxpressivepicture. Indeed be may have gone through all  the mathematical studies ever proposed ns subjects of education, and still manifest no sentiment but that of the most vulgar and illiterate, a sordid calculating spirit, seeking only  selfish gratification, prompted to exertion solely by the supreme  love of pelf, or some other equally unsocial appetite or affec-  tioih Tho perusal of writings, which, like the Latin and  (.(reek poets, orators, philosophers, and historians, supply the  soundest maxims of prudence, the clearest axioms of moral  truth, and the most abundant materials for reflection and con-  rsation, is surely more beneficial in a general system of  ucation, than the study of Conic Sections, and Spherical  Trigonometry, Differential and Integral Calculus. But it  will be said, the business of education is not to teach lan-  n-es, especially dead languages, but the arts and sciences.  What arts?

Is the intention of a liberal education, to make|ed professions, the most active and useful public officers, the  surveyors and engineers, shop-keepers, and sailors, or physi- most eminent divines, lawyers, and physicians, are in general  those who have been educated at classical schools.

To what are the senate, the pulpit, the bar, indebted  for their greatest honors? Is it not to eloquence? Whence  is this eloquence derived? From the study of arithmetic  and algebra, geometry and trigonometry, or from the Belles  Lettres, from polite literature, from the classics? We would  not detract a tittle from the honors due to science, nor yet  Irom those useful accomplishments, the arts of spelling, reading, writing, and ciphering. But we maintain, that something  more is necessary to enter with advantage on the study of the  learned professions. But many have risen to distinction in  society, and in their profession, who were destitute of classical  learning. This, if it proves any thing, proves too much. By  the samo mode of reasoning, we might demonstrate all education to be useless. For some have been elevated to eminent stations who were altogether uneducated. Again, in  this enterprising and money-making country, many, from a  very low origin and an exceedingly humble beginning, have  attained to enormous opulence. But how little is overgrown  wealth, associated with ignorance and vulgarity, calculated  to advance the happiness of its possessor, or to render him  truly respectable and influential in society !    For want of a  sions, the pride of their countrymen, the glory of their country ; n majority of whom have enjoyed, to some extent, the  benefits of classical instruction. Who nre the theoretical and  visionary, the enthusiastic, and superstitious, the fanatics and  imposlors, but men who, without a foundation of classical  learning, and destitute of any solid attainments, endeavor to  carry into execution their preposterous plans, their destructive and often impracticable projects ? We grant that monpv  may often be accumulated in abundance, by illiterate persons,  whose energies, both of mind and body, are continually directed to the acquisition of gain, and that wealth may imparl  to them a degree of importance and consequence in the opinion of the unthinking multitude: but honor, esteem, consideration in society, the approbation of the thoughtful and discerning, are reserved for that sort of practical man, who has  added to the possession of sound sense, the acquirements of  the scholar, and the polish of the gentleman. Then let not  this stale objection about the want of practical utility in clas-  capacity to appreciate llic refined delights of literature, in sieal studies, which indeed lies in a much greater degree  consequence of a defective or erroneous education, how many against ihchigher branches ofpurcmalhematics, an objection  are led to the gaming table and grog-shop, to the haunts of which has been n thousand times repeated, and as often refuted, be any longer reiterated. If we form our ideas according to the vulgar notion of utility, the plough is obviously a  more useful instrument than the telescope, and the ploughman a more important personage than the astronomer. The  grand object ol liberal education, we take it, is not to teach  manual labor and servile employments, but to expand the intellect, to refine the taste, to liberalize the views, to elevate the  moral feelings, to assimilate, in fine, the immortal heaven-descended soul of man, to the great Author of his existence, lo  qualify for respectability anil extensive usefulness here, and  endless happiness hereafter.  Bonaparte has been referred to as an exemplification of th"  beneficial effects resulting from mathematical studies. If th"  art of slaughtering human beings in the most expeditious and  scientific manner, and the calculating with numerical exactness bow many valuable lives must he sacrificed to besiege a |  town, or storm a fort, be the art of all most worthy to be nil-  tivated, then we must acknowledge that the French Emperoi  Stands, in modern times at least, pre-eminent and unrivalled. '  This great destroyer of his species, this mighty Juggernaut,  beneath whoso advancing triumphal car were crushed mil'  infamy and ruin, lo pass away the time, and get rid of the en  nui which oppresses them? What miserable havoc is made  of the king's English, and what ridiculous blunders are often  committed by men who attempt lo write, or to speak in public  in consequence of their not knowing the exact meaning of  words! This knowledge is only to be acquired by a faithful  study of the Latin and Greek, or of English writers written  on the model of the ancient classics. Some, I know, like our  own beloved Washington, have, without classical instruction,  attained an admirable style. But such exceptions rather tend  lo confirm than invalidate the general principle. Men of  the dwarfish stature of ordinary mortals, will surely not measure themselves by the standard of such colossal intellects.  Great men must ever be chiefly self-taught. In them nature  supplies tho deficiencies of education. Another objection demands a passing notice. It is said the education we propose,  is not sufficiently practical, that classical scholars are seldom  practical men, men of business habits. What is intended by  the term practical! If it he meant that studying Latin and  Greek does not make a man practically acquainted with husbandry, and carpentry, with the use of the plough and spade,  of the axe and plane, with the veterinary art, and various oth- lions ol  idolizing and adoring subjects, and in whose worship :  er most useful  arts and employments, we readily grant il.

He wanted the refiiiementund humanity which classical studies  alone impart. ■  The calculating system of politics, considers  men commercially and  numerically, not as beings possessed  of fine sensibilities, ever " trembling at the touch of joy, or  woe," but a*s living engines capable of productive labor.    A  political economy founded solely on  calculation, can never  advance the happiness of rational  beings, formed to feel as  well as to feed, to think as well  as to vegetate, to enjoy as  well as to  labor.    A calculating policy, derived probably  from his mathematical education,  rendered  Napoleon careless of the waste of human life', and regardless of the claims  of humanity.    He sacrificed liberty and religion, as well as  the Belles Lcttres, on the altar of a bloody ambition.    Under  his auspices, the mathematics were rendered subservient to  those gigantic projects of personal aggrandizement, which  aimed at nothing less than the dominion of the world.    In his  reign, the war-spirit, which it has been said ihe peculiar tendency of the classics is to foster, was manifested by men, who  had not the least tincture of classical learning, but were profound mathematicians, engineers,  and tacticians.    Then all  Europe became  one vast camp.    Every where wero heard  die din of arms, and the sound of preparation for deadly con-  flict.    Oceans of precious blood were poured forth, rivers of  briny tears flowed, the groans of the widowed  mother, the  ivild wail of the fatherless children, ascended to Heaven, and  reached the ear of the God of battles.    The man " of destiny," whose edicts hud appeared like the deeices of omnipotence, rendered  giddy by ihe height to  which  be had been  son. A dry, jejune, inelegant style, can never become popular. The profoundest books of science, composed in a dull,  heavy, clumsy maimer, speedily sink into neglect. Soon they  ascend to the upper shelves ol the library, where they arc allowed to remain unmolested, save by the worm and spider.  Mathematics seem lo have a peculiar tendency to clip the  wings of fancy, and to obtund tho finer sensibilities of the  heart. Let arithmetic, and the oilier exact sciences, constitute  the whole of education, men would have nothing else to do  but to measure and calculate. Rhetoric would be proscribed,  and poetry banished. Every thing would then be reduced  lo " mathematic rule," and more in obedience to "mathematic  law." Man himself, stript of fancy and feeling, might be  made a mere machine, as unimaginative and insensible as an  automaton, which moves only by mechanic springs.  All nature, it has been remarked, is constructed on mathematical principles. Is this true? On the contrary, are not  the grandest, as well as the most beautiful natural objects remarkable for irregularity and variety ? The rugged mountain, the verdant valley, the stream that winds through the enamelled mead, the flower that decks its bunks, the tree that  lifts its majestic form, laden with fruitage and foliage to the  breeze, tho bird that sports through its branches, and fairer  than all, "the human face divine," derive not their attractions  from mathematical figures. Whichof the mathematic curves  is the curve of beauty! How tiresome a uniformity would  pervade the works of nature, were all things reduced to  ubes and cones, to pyramids, spheres and parallellopipeds?  I is not true, then, of the animal, and vegetable, and only to  a limited extent of the mineral kingdom.  elevated in the pursuit of false glory, was precipitated from!    We here begJleave to introduce a quotation from Locke,  lofty eminence. The last act of the great tragedy of  twenty years, closed with the fatal scene of Waterloo, which  made the haughty monarch a prisoner and an exile from the  land of his adoption and his glory. Chained to the barren  rock el St. Helena, like another Prometheus, disappointment,  chagrin, and remorse preying on his vitals, ho soon fe'll a victim lo the restless activity of his own nature, now turned  against itself He will forever remain a monument of blasted ambition, a beacon in the deep to warn the adventurer who  rides the waves of a "sea of glory," ofthe hidden rucks  which lurk beneath its deceitful surface. Since the downfal  el Napoleon, the classics, which by him were proscribed and  banished, as uncongenial, doubtless, with the spirit of military  despotism, have been restored to their just rank in the system  ol French education. This virtual recantation of their former sentiments in regard to tho classics, does equal honor to  the head and hearl, to the good sense, as well as good feel in J  of that ingenious and highly polished nation.  Not only do the classics constitute the broad and stable fouii  elation, the only sure basis on which to erect the beautiful and  majestic temple of science J but even science itself, with all  its celestial nature, its exact symmetry, its graceful proportions, and its lofty sublimity, requires the embellishments of  rhetoric, the decorations of style, the classical elegance of  composition, to recommend it to the mass of mankind, who,  in the general, are more sensitive than rational, more under  fir  partly wilh a view 10 exhibit his sentiments on the subject of  classical education, but more particularly to show the style of  one who condemns the classics, and rejects all tho ornaments  of rhetorical embellishment, upon which from the proud  heights of philosophy, he doubtlesss looked down with a degree of contempt. " The character of a sober man is what  everyone expects in a tutor. This is generally thought  enough. But when this sober man has emptied out into his  pupil all the Latin and logic he brought from the university,  will that furniture make him a gentleman ?

How many are allured to the love of learning and a studious  life by the charms of poetic diction and sentiment, who are  deterred by the repulsive aspect ofthe elementary mathematics, which address themselves neither to the feelings nor the  imagination? The Belles Lotties scatter roses amid  ihbrns of• abstruse disquisition, smooth the asperities of the  rugged road, that leads to the summit of iho hill of science',  and light up an attractive smile, even on the gloomy countenance of scholastic philosophy. They bind their graceful  wreath around iho austere brow of science, lend attraction to  virtue's august form, and insinuate into the heart, by all ihe  soft aits of reason and rhetoric combined. Like the harp  of Orpheus, they can reclaim the barbarian, and soothe the  savage by the melody of eloquence. They have contributed  more than the sciences to humanize and lo civilize mankind.  In the classics especially, all the matchless harmony of numbers, all the glowing imagery of fancy, are employed for the  purpose of enforcing truth, and recommending virtue. The  muses and the graces, with their sister train of kindred virtues, may be said lo lead on their votaries through the flowery fields of classic literature, whose ways are indeed ways of  pleasantness, and all whose paths are peace. Far retired  from the bustle of commerce, the strife of politics, and the  din of arms, the student contemplates the bright examples of  ancient sages, heroes, patriots, and statesmen, who adorn the  annals of Grecian and Roman history. Familiar with such  examples, he goes forth into the world full of noble and generous emulation, an enthusiast in the cause of truth and honor.  Pox, the illustrious English orator and statesman, spent a  great part of his boyhood, under the direction of his father,  in studying the lives of statesmen and heroes, as recorded  and contrasted in the parallels of Plutarch. Lord Chatham  also, whose Roman virtue, and more than Roman dignity of  eloquence, are the admiration of the world, owed much of tl  grandeur of his ideas, and his enthusiastic ardor in the cause  of liberty, to the models with .which he was early familiarized, and to which be applied himself con amore during his  whole life, ill the celebrated works of the Chaeronean biographer. What excellent lessons are presented on tho instruct,  ive page of this admirable writer, for the education of youth,  who may there learn to imitate the legislative wisdom of a  .Solon and a Lycurgus, and be led to emulate, while they admire, the wonderful achievements of Roman and ol Spartan  valor? Indeed, were I to select the ancient book (the Bible  always excepted ) best calculated to excite the youthful mind  to all that is great and good, I should unquestionably, beyond  all others, recommend Plutarch's Lives.  Writing, arithmetic, a smattering of French, a little Latin,  just enough to huvu it to say that be once studied Latin, with  a few superficial accomplishments, such as dancing, musir,  fencing, &C, are. generally thought quite sufficient for th,,  complete education of a gentleman. With this, or even a  much inferior preparation, many consider themselves fully  qualified lo discharge, with credit to themselves and their  country, ihe highest offices of state. And though, unforln-  nntely, such'men nre sometimes raised, by tho frolic of for.  tune, quotirs fortuna voluit jocari, to stations of great dignity and importance, yet it is usually only to expose them to ridicule and a constant and painful sense of their inferiority and  incompetency for the task which they havo undertaken, ,\  superficial education has auendency to create a spirit of levity. This spirit, when fostered by the perusal of novels nnd  the other light and worthless literature of the day, is well calculated to form a frivolous and trifling character, a flippant,  conceited coxcomb, who enjoys bis happy self-love without a  rival, and the admiration of his wonderful person without a  single one to envy his felicity.    How contemptible is such a  haracterl How unworthy a rational being-, born to ocl  a dignified and serious part in the great drama of human  life ! Mankind are too apt to lose sight of all that is heroic,  public-spirited and magnanimous. Modern times have formed to themselves a virtue rather polished than sublime', that  consists in petty courtesies, rather than the tranquil grandeur  of an elevated mind. It is by turning from the pelit-mailres  of the present day, lo men like Fahricius and Cain, thai wo  are brought to recollect the dignity of human   nature.    A  reatparl of ihe prejudice against the study of Latin and Greek  in our own country, has originated from the very inaccurate and superficial manner in which they are usually taught,  Should the student be so fortunate as to comprehend the meaning of an author, by a wretched pronunciation he loses a  great part of his beauty and harmony. It is high time thai  this barbarous intermixture of long and short syllables, this  "Connecticut Latin," as Mr. Jefferson terms it, should be banished from all our schools. The mischiefs inflicted by superficial, tasteless, and indolent teachers-, are not confined to the  sphere of their direct influence, but extend to the cause of  classical learning itself, which is thus made to suffer for faull!  not its own, nnd the imputation of defects which do not attach  to a correct system of instruction. We think, however, thni  we seethe dawning uf a brighter day, when classical learning, being presented in all its native beauty and intrinsic excellence, shah be duly appreciated and properly cultivated,  The labors of Professor Anthon, and other eminent scholars,  havo contributed greatly towards rescuing this branch of literature from the neglect into which it appears lo have been falling, and by elucidating the obscurities of the more difficult  lUthors, anil pointing out their various beauties of style and  sentiment, have tended to diffuse a justor taste, and a more  correct mode of studying the classics, in no respect has the  defectiveness of our American system of education been so-  apparent, as iho manner in which the study of the Greek  language has been usually prosecuted. By many, indeed,  this study is thought totally superfluous.

We readily grant that an inaccurate and superficial knowledge of Greek, or indeed of any  1 other language, is of little use. But why should it bo inaccurate, why need it be superficial? Though it is not to be  expected, nor perhaps desired, that every one should rival a  Poison, or a Parr, in the profundity and extent of his attainments, yet why may not bis knowledge he thorough, as far as  il extends? Accuracy should never he dispensed with, hut  should he rigidly exacted. He that shall learn to construe'  ami parse, with facility and correctness, even the Greek Tes-  lamcnt, and the easy works of Xenophon, the Anabasis and  t'viopieilia, will have acquired no mean amount of know-  It jge He will carry with him besides into every other de-  iiarttncnl of study, to every other subject, the same habits of  accurate analysis, and exact thought. Those who doubt the  utility of Greek, as part of a general system of liberal education, will not deny its indispensable necessity to the student of  theology, whose profession is to expound tho sacred records  which contain the charter of our salvation; whim they recollect it was the language in which our Lord and his apostles  spoke and wrote, and thnt the best translation of the Old Tcs-  lament, and the one which most illustrates the New, is tho  Scptuagint.  It has been proposed to substitute Hebrew, and modem  languages, in place of Latin and Greek. We would prefer  seeing these superadded to a classical course, hut not superseding it. When Jupiter speaks, says Cicero, it is in ihe dialed of Plato When Jehovah, may the Christian say wilh  truth, condescended to hold converse with his creatures, it was  in the appropriate language of bis chosen people, the laconic,  expressive, and majestic dialect of the Hebrews, which compensates for tho scantiness of its vocabulary, by its fulness of  signification, in which every word contains a world of meaning, conveying not only the principal, but all the accessory  ideas. It is unnecessary to expatiate on the transe'oiidunt excellence of this consecrated language. Its beautiful simplicity fits it alike for the expression of the tender, the pathetic,  and the sublime. In these respects, the sacred writings, independently of their divine authority, in the opinion of ihose  best qualified to judge, far surpass all Greek, all Roman excellence, Wo hope this study will soon be introduced into  all our colleges.  Shall we substitute modern languages and authors? They  cannot furnish the same intellectual discipline. They arc not  su highly polished and finished. They are not the acknowledged models of taste, and standards of criticism. Time has  not yet pronounced a verdict in their favor; nor can they  compare with the Latin and Greek writers, crowned ns theso  arc with the laurel of assenting lime, by the unanimous agreement of all ages and nations.  The (irecian and Roman writers are, with the exception of  the sacred records, and a few unimportant fragments, all that  remains of the history, and embodied thought of the world  Ibr 40110 years. What do we know of the history of Egypt,  Assyria, Persia, Tyre, nnd Carthage, except what we derive  horn the historians of Greece and Rome?    Had they not  been thus preserved, and ejiiialmeo, so to speak, the last memorials of them would have perished, and nothing would  have remained to tell that they ever existed, but a few broken  columns, and their almost obliterated inscriptions. The finished productions of mind alone, like itself, are immortal. Go  now to the Eternal. City, once the world's imperial mistress,  and view the crumbling monuments of her former magnificence, her temples, amphitheatres, aqueducts, and triumphal  arches, which barbarian fury and Christian zeal, have nearly demolished, and then contrast with them the works of her  immortal writers, which have escaped the ravages of five, the  sword, and all devouring time. While the former are dilapidated anil decayed, the latter still remain in all their pristine  grandeur and beauty, and will remain to the end of time the  admiration and delight of all ages.  Rome, indeed, no longer sways the iron sceptre of military  or ecclesiastical despotism, over a submissive world, but the  dominion of her deathless writers yet continues. It is truly  m imperium sine fine* hounded only by the limits of civilization, and the duration of time itself. As subjugated Athens  gave law to her haughty victors the Romans, in matters of  taste and philosophy; so Rome,in tuin, subdued her barbarian conquerors by the. humanizing influence of letters and  the arts. The light which once so gloriously illuminated the  hanks of tho Ilissus and the Tiber still sheds its mild, its benign radiance over the nations. The ephemeral productions  of the modern press, enjoy, for awhile, the sunshine of popular favor, live out their brief day of fashionable celebrity, and  then expire. One system of philosophy yields to another,  one hook of science supplants another: and they successively  fall, as new discoveries are made, into neglect, or oblivion.  Over the classic writers of Greece and Rome, time has lost  its destroying power. It only makes us more sensible of the  merit of works which address the feelings and fancy, as well  is the reason and judgment. Slill sports the playful muse of  Anacreon, with the Loves and Graces, amid myrtle groves,  mil beds of roses. Wedded to immortal verse, still breathes  the love, still live the fires of the poetess of Lesbos, the "burning Sappho." Nonomnismoriar,] I shall not wholly die, exclaims the sweet bard of Vcnusiiim, when, in the enthusiasm  of poetic inspiration, he measures the extent and duration of  his own fame by that of the Roman Empire. His prediction  has been more than verified. His works have survived the  destruction of tho Capitol, which the Romans fondly hoped  would be eternal, and his fame has extended beyond the Ultima Thule of antiquity, beyond the Atlantic, isles, beyond the  "ocean-flood," to new-born nations in the far distant West.  He lives, and will forever live, enshrined in the gratitude, the  admiration, and affection of the lovers of genuine poetry  through nil succeeding ages.  Should the classics be discarded from our systems of instruction, they would he replaced, probably, by an education  merely commercial and mechanical, or, at best, but scientific  and military, and barbarity might soon prevail where now  flourish the studies of humanity.

Banish the classics, and the cause of science itself, of  liberty and religion, would suffer detriment. A people trained merely to mercantile and military pursuits, actuated solely  by the desire of gain and the love ol conquest, would be fit  instruments for the artful demagogue and aspiring chieftain;  would be, as they doubtless would soon become, like the  French, proper subjects for the despotism of a Grand Mon-  arque, a lordly aristocracy, and a corrupt hierarchy. Our  politicians, instructed not in the generous learning of Greece  and Rome, but in the lessons of mere calculation and measurement, instead of possessing liberal and expanded views  of policy, would be men of narrow, selfish, contracted spirits.

THE EPIDEMIC YELLOW FEVERS OP NATCHEZ.  " IN   MEDIO VKttl'I'.VS "  An !&gt;say rcml l.eferr the Jeffemon College, tincf Washington Lyceum, Iit-r, S  1837, I.) .1. W. MoNsn-B, M, li.  Notwithstanding the great diversity of opinions, entertain  ed by medical men, relative to the nature and production of  yellow-fever miasm, and its operation upon the human system in producing thai disease epidemically j some points are  admitted, on all hands, as facts attending its production, extension, and destruction, in cities, and certain other localities.  It is admitted on all sides, that, at certain times, a peculiar not be known  in the evening dews, and accumulates in low, damp places,  near the ground; that it is more rarified by the sun, and oV  stroyed entirely by cold, or the abstraction of heat down to  32" Fall. Then it must be admitted, that if it can be confined  in a bouse, a ship, or a balloon, it can also be carried from  one place to another, where it will be equally deleterious as.  before it was transported, provided its temperature, be not reduced too near 32" of Fahrenheit, and provided it be not too  much diluted with pure, common air. If so, then it must be  admitted, that it can produce yellow fever in any place to  which it may be carried and breathed in accordance with the  above conditions: or, a portion of it maybe introduced into  a hot, confined, and contaminated atmosphere, and produce  there the assimilating process; and thus in some degree ex-  tend itself: and the miasm or infection thus generated, will he  quully efficient in producing the disease, as the original  source from which it was taken. This principle is exemplified in the infected air which is shut up in houses during an  epidemic, yellow-fever. A storm, or gale of wind, may so  completely carry off the out-door infection, that the epidemic  will almost cease: yet so soon as the "leaven " of infection  which is retained in the houses and enclosures, can diffuse  itself, and again effect the assimilating process in (he general  air, the epidemic will again break forth, with renewed vim-  lence. The malignity of the disease is in direct proportion  to tho virulence of the infection; and if, after such a change  of weather, the disease again becomes equally malignant, the  newly generated infection is equally deleterious with the original : and this, wc believe, is the result of an assimilating  process, which the infection can, and doe? eflect, in a suitable  atmosphere.  It is admitted that yellow fever is endemic all the year  within the tropics, and in some places more than in others:  that, although its habitation is properly intertropical, its great-  st ravages arc among northern strangers, and that it would  pidemic in the tropics, were it not for  miasm is generated, which will excite, in healthy individuals the constant influx of northern strangers, who, when numhws  who breathe it and who are not natiiralizi d to it, a peculiar|0f them are attacked, sometimes cause the infection to become  o concentrated that it will produce an epidemic even amort":  malignant fever, or disease termed by common consent, ycllme  fever: that this miasm, or aerial poison, may he confined in  bouses, rooms, and other similar places, with all its deleterious  properties, even after the surrounding general atmosphere,  which is iincoiifincel and free in ils circulation, has become entirely healthy: that this poisonous malaria, in rooms, ships  &c, insinuates itself into every opening, recess, or interstice,  into which common air can penetrate, especially near the  surface ofthe ground: that when diffused in a hot and sultry  atmosphere, ii has a property of extending itself gradually,  nnd sometimes rapidly, and of imparting to that atmosphere  a deleterious property, which will excite yellow fever: or  thai it assimilates a sultry, hot atmosphere to its own nature  or impregnates it with the miasmatic poison, so as to produce  yellow fever, and in this manlier spreads through a city: that  this miasm may become so concentrated, as to produce yellow-  fever in unaccliinated persons who breathe it, even in very  small quantities: or it may he so far diluted by pure, com-  inonair, as to produce no sensible effect in those who respire  it freely: that it is heavier than the common air, and settles  the indigenous or acclimated inhabitants. This increase, or  concentration of miasm, or infection, is apparently owintr  solely to the further vitiation of the local atmosphere, by the  number of bodies laboring under that disease: for, in the  West Indies, and other places subject to yellow fever, it is  known to prevail generally among unaccliinated persons or  strangers, and does not attack the natives, until after a large'  number of strangers have died. Hence, in those countries  and cities where it is endemic nearly all the year, it is called  the " strangers' fever." It is known also, that when the infection (or miasm) is sufficiently concentrated to produce yellow fever, in its most malignant forms, among strangers and  unaccliinated persons, the natives, or naturalized inhabitants,  if attacked at all, will be affected with it in a much milder  form,  It is generally admitted by all parties, when a city, or certain district in a city, is attacked wilh yellow fever, that there  exists in that district the peculiar miasm of yellow fever; and  that strangers, or ncn-residents, or a portion of them, who  SOHB  EM 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/437	437	438.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/438.jp2

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  71  pass into the infected district, and breathe the atmosphere so  infected with yellow-fever miasm, will contract that disease;  and that it will dovelopc itself in their systems in five or six  days, as a general rule : and that this disease may be de  oped in such persons, even in its most aggravated forms, at'  any place to which they may have travelled in the interim  whether it be far or near. It is also admitted, that those who  reside in an infected district, and have continued to breathe  ihe air while tho infection or miasm was weak, or generating  in small quantities, acquire a partial immunity, by becoming  naturalized, or acclimated to it; but that they also will take  the disease, and die from it, when tho miasm becomes more  abundant, or more virulent. This is exemplified every year;  fnr healthy, unaccliinated persons have contracted the disease in cities and places, while the resident inhabitants were  healthy, or not affected with yellow fever.  It is also known and admitted by all parties, that when yel  Ion- fever is epidemic in any part of a city, that the infected  atmosphere, when confined in a close room for several days,  at a temperature of not less than 80™ of Fahrenheit, loses  none of its properties, but often acquires a new degree of virulence.    As before observed, it is known that this miasm, or  infection, when it exists in abundance, as it does in all infected places, diffuses itself into every recess and interstice into  which common air can penetrate.    Hence every chamber,  '  every alley, street, avenue and cellar, within its limits, becomes alike infected during an epidemic.    It diffuses  itself  also in beds, bedding, and bales of blankets, and other porous  articles, which always contain much air: and when retained  in th"se, in a suitable temperature, it often acquires an increased virulence, in like manner with that which has been con-  liaed in close rooms.    But when, in addition lo  the infected  air of the rooms, the beds are saturated with tho secretions  and exhalations of human bodies in disease, it is called fomi-  tes,orfames, and is, decidedly, in all infectious diseases, more  morbific lhan the infection diffused in the open air.    In yellow fever, the exhalations from the diseased body unquestionably add to the virulence of the infected air, when so confined: hence this kind of infection, (or fames,) is more deleterious  to all who breathe it, than the infection of the open air.  liya careful estimate and calculation, it will bo found, that  a common feather bed, when stirred up loosely, contains from  twenty to twenty-five cubic feet of air, varying according to  its size; and each pillow will contain from two to four cubic  led of air; the feathers, if reduced to a solid, constitute less  than one-twentieth of that bulk. Blankets, and other clothing, contain air likewise in proportion to their texture. Now  all these articles, in an infected district, become charged with  the infected air of that district, just as they do with common  healthy air, in a healthy season. The confinement of the infected air, so as to prevent its dispersion in the general atmosphere, increases its power of producing disease, in proportion  to the closeness and the temperature in which it is kept: and  BS yellow fever miasm and infection are destroyed by a temperature below 40" Fahrenheit, it will acquire new virulence  ""Iy when its temperature is above that point, and most at a  temperature between 85 and 00" Fahrenheit.    Now, if the ~    IT „,  ,1   * floe Quarterly Jour, of For. Meq, ror April, w«,  °pen air of a certain district be capable of producing a cer'l   (Medical Recorder, vol 9, rp. 37,33,33.  tain disease in those who breathe it, and if the air contuined  in beds, &c, bo of the same quality, but more virulent, why  should not this infected air, transported in such nrlicles to on-  other place, bo capable of producing the same disease in those  who there breathe it,as well as nearer the source of infection ?  It would be a paradox if the mere act of transportation should  neutralize its morbific properties,  When a person sleeps upon u bed, or upon porous articles  of bedding, whether charged with healthy or infected air, he  of necessity breathes more or less of it: his body presses out  of a feather bed an equal bulk of air, which settles around  him, and is respired with the common air of the room. Other portions of it are likewise pressed out by each movement,  or change of position, and are likewise respired. Thus, in  sleeping upon a bed one night, in all probability an individual  presses out and respires all the air which it previously contained, whether healthy or infected.  Thus fir it matters not from what source, or in what manner the poison of yellow fever is produced; or in what manner it produces its effects upon the human system. Wc will  call it infection, and, for the sake of argument, admit that it is  produced from any source which may suit the fancy of our  readers; still it must be admitted that it can produce the disease called yellow fever, wherever it is respired in its undiluted state; or when only moderately diluted with sultry,  contaminated air.  As to the peculiar nature and composition, of this malaria,  or poison of yellow fever, we know nothing, except by ils  effects upon the human system. Of its qualities, we know  only by induction ; and some of ils general laws are deduced  from repeated observation. In its effects upon the system, it  issupposed by Baron Larrey* and others, and the supposition  is sustained by my distinguished friend Dr. Oartwright.t  of Natchez, that it is respired, and from the lungs, through  the medium of the ganglionic system of nerves, produces its  deleterious effects upon all the functions of animal and organic life. Those, deleterious effects, taken together, constituto  yellow fever.  Whether bodies laboring under yellow fever, are capable of  throwing off any exhalation or effluvium possessing or deriving morbific, properties, is a point yet disputed, although  the general practice and the piecautions inculcated, even by  those who profess to believe it strictly non-contagious, tend to  convince the unprejudiced, that all parties admit the principle, although they deny tho fact. The general admission,  of those who disclaim either side of the question, is that,  whin yellow fever makes its appearance as nn epidemic in  a city, or in a district of a city, each additional case tends  still further to contaminate the air, or in either words to increase the virulence ofthe infection which is abroad. None  but those who havo been much conversant with yellow  fever in the southern part of the United States or in the  West Indies, should hazard an opinion to the contrary ; even  then their observation and discernment might bo questionable.

'  the infected air more morbific, it lriusl be by some exhalation thrown off from the lungs or skin; for it is hardly possible that the general infection should he rendered more  active and morbific by the loss or consumption of those portions of it required to produce the disease in those attacked. The consumption, or taking away a part, certainly  cannot change the qualities of the remainder; and the  only inference remaining is, that each body laboring under  the disease, becomes a new source of contamination to the  local atmosphere, however small may be the influence of each.  The lungs and the skin are two of the greatest einuiie-  tories of the human system, and carry off more fluids in a  gaseous form, than all the other excretories together. The  llitid which passes off by insensible perspiration from the  skin alone, in the form of gas or vapor, is equal to about  five pounds in twenty-four hours; the same from the lungs,  in the same time is about seven pounds—besides which  each respiration deprives the air breathed of u part of its  ogygon, and imparls to it a portion of carbonic acid gas or  other gaseous compounds. The effluvia thus thrown out  by a healthy body, or by a number of healthy bodies, are  more or less pernicous to those who respire them;—how  much more su then are they from bodies laboring under a  pestilential disease? A portion of these exhalations is diffused in the air nnd wafted and lost by free ventilation in  the general atmosphere; another portion is absorbed into  the beds and bedding used by the sick, which in close air  acquires a new degree of virulence. This is evidently admitted by the non-contagionists, when they enjoin free ventilation and cleanliness as a precaution for safety, to those  who nurse yellow fever patients. If this effluvium were  not thrown olf; or if it were not morbific, why enjoin the necessity of cleanliness and ventilation about the sick chamber 'I  This may be infection, or it may not be. But all diseases, and especially epidemics are in some degree infectious, ami require more or less the precaution of cleanliness  and ventilation, There are two kinds of morbific matter  eliminated from bodies diseased: which is by some called  contagion, or infection: the one is a gaseous exhalation,  and the other a palpable matter of secretion.    Some diseases  throw off one kind of infection, and some the other:  I  some, such ns small-pox, plague, and malignant erysipelas,  throw oil'both kinds of infection. Others, such as vaccine  pock, are communicated only by a palpable virus, (if  those infections thrown oil* a gaseous form, some are so mild  as scarcely to be estimated; others are more active, but  still controllable by proper care to bbviate the circumstan  ccs of close air, concentration of the effluvium, by  maintaining cleanliness and a proper temperature: others,  as small pox, throw off a subtle exhalation, which, under  nearly all circumstances, is infectious to the distance of a few-  feet, in all suites of temperature. The same may be said of  typhus and jail fever, which requires a cool or cold damp air  for its dissemination. The matter of contagion is originally  morbific per se: other diseases give off an effluvium which  becomes morbific, or infectious, under certain circumstances:  thus of yellow fever.  In relation to yellow fever, tho great error of both tbecon-  tagionists and tho non-contagionists, is altruism. Thenon  contagieuiist, because be, believes that personal contagion ha.  no agency in the extrication ofthe miasm in tho first instance  seems to think he would bo inconsistent if he admitted person,  al infection possible in any case. The contugioiiist, because he  believes the disease capable of reproducing itself by an infec.  lions exhalation, thinks ho would be inconsistent, were he u  admit the possibility of the disease being produced otherwise  In this, as in many other disputed questions, we believe out  motto indicates the correct course, " In medio est lulissimui■"  for a disease may certn inly be epidemic, and in some detrre  infectious also : and a disease may sometimes originate from  some peculiar exciting circumstances, and yet, when produced, possess properties slightly infectious. For llie first  case of the most infectious disease, must have originated without personal contagion. If a disease be capable of reproducing itself once in a hundred limes, under the most favorable circumstances, it is certainly infectious. The infection is  specific, because in all eases it produces the same disease as  ihat from which the infection was produced. A disease which  spreads alone by personal infection or contagion, makes but  slow advances from one individual to another; while epidemic I  infectious diseases, attack a number of individuals in close  succession. If yellow fever possess no infectious qualities,  in impart none to the air, or clothing, to beds, blankets, &c.  why use the precaution of cleanliness and ventilation?  I Ir.  Hush is the author of the most enlightened views on  the subject of yellow liver ; and when he wrote, a very gen  oral belief was, that it spread by contagion alone; or by llic  exhalations from one person to another, exclusively of nn infected atmosphere.    Under this state of things, ihe sick were  often deserted to their fate, by those who believed in the doctrine of specific contagion.    They believed thnt it was pro I  duced .solely by communication with those sick of yclkm !  iiver, and from their infected clothes, &c.    Hence it wash,- l  lieved, that the great precaution for safety, consisted in keep \  ing as remote as possible from the sick ; and where this beliel j  olitaine-d  generally, the sick wero neglected and abandoned |  by those who entertained such views.    Dr. Rush, in his zealous and philanthropic labors to remove this error, frequently  carried his arguments even beyond the point ut which he  would have rested, had such prejudico not obtained so generally.    He Strove to convince the people, that the disease nil  tho result of local causes and circumstances; and not pro- .  duced solely by the emanation from a diseased body, or from .  a secret contagion brought from the West Indies; by which  one  man was  infected; to whom all other cases were to 1»'  traced,    In his  eflbrls to disabuse the public mind on this'  point, it was not necessary to stop and discuss tho exceptions  to the general rule; it was politic  in him to pass them by, I  and direct all his efforts to establish the great fundamental!  truths which he was inculcating. Hence, nearly all his writ-  ings go to show, that it was of domestic origin,and spread '  from an infected atmosphere, more or less local.    It was his  business to break down the general prejudice, and preparf  tho way for calm and impartial reasoning : this bo did: and  left it to his successors, and to other times, when public sentiment  should he  prepared, lo define the precise nature nnd 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/439	439	440.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/440.jp2

In pointing a local cause sufli  t-ieiit to contaminate the air of a city, or district, it became him  to urge upon them the ngency of those prominent cause  which they would most readily admit, until such time as more  light might be let in upon the subject; and when the preconceived opinions of contagion might be so modified as to  ensure a patient hearing and consideration. Hence he di  reded public attention especially to putrid animal and vegeta  Wc matters in the city, about the wharves and shipping, and  to city filth :—matters which were perceptible, and withal re  volting to llieir senses, and which, of course, would chain  their attention. But now, when the barrier of error has been  broken down, we may begin to examine the subject more m  imtcly, and, if possible, fix the precise limits where truth and  error meet. To contribute to this end is our object, and we  hope wo shall be beard patiently and with a desire to arrive  at truth, more than to establish or confute any particular theory or set of opinions. The grand fundamental point eon-  tended for by Dr. Rush, is, that the yellow fever is and has  often been generated by the local circumstances inourcowi-  mercial cities. But he admits, that, under certain circumstances, it may tend to reproduce itself. He admits that it  will not spread from a few cases in a pure air, and that in nn  impure or miasmatic air it will spread. This miasmatic air  he contends is produced from animal and vegetable putrifac-  tion, in certain states of weather. We also say yellow fever  will spread, and become epidemic in an air strongly charged  wilh miasm; but wc ascribe the miasm to a different cause.  Dr. Rush says, "yellow fever is not contagious (infectious? ) in its simple state1, and spreads exclusively by means of  exhalations from putrid matters, which are diffused in the  air. That it docs not spread in the ( pure air of ihe ) country, when c:; ried thither from cities in the United States:  That it does not spread in yellow fever hospitals, when they  orosituated beyond the influence of the impure air in which  it is generated. * * That it generally requires the co-operation of an exciting cause, with miasmata to produce it."  Med, Repos. v. G, p. 15G, &c.  In relation to yellow fever patients, confined in close, sultry, filthy rooms, where the exhalations and excretions arc  suffered 10 accumulate, ho admits it to be infectious. He  says, " 1 have heard of two or three instances in which the  yellow fever was propagated by these means, in the country.  remote from the place where it originated, as well as from  every external source of putrid exhalation." I hid. p. 157.  Dr. Hush says, or admits, that yellow fever may be contracted by "a person sleeping in the sheets or upon a bed  impregnated with the sweats and other excretions, or by being  exposed to thesuiell (breathing?) of the foul linen or other  clothing of persons who bad the yellow fever." "That it  Was onco produced in Philadelphia from the effluvia from a  chest of unwashed clothes, which had belonged to one of our  citizens, who had died with it in Barbadoes: but it extended  no further in a large family, than to the person who opened  the chest." He accounts for this happening so seldom, by  "the superstitious dread of contagion, which has generally  produced great care not only in washing sheets and clothes,  and airing beds supposed to be infected, but frequently the  total destruction of them by water or fire!' Ibid. Here the  most eloquent champion of the non-contagious nature of yellow fever, and one of the most learned retiologisls admits all  that we contend for: that an effluvium is generated from a yellow fever patient, which is capable, under favorable circumstances, of reproducing that disease, in those who breathe it.  His explanation of the modus operandi, does not accord with  our views of the subject: the fact is important. Still we do  not consider it essentially a contagious disease, notwithstanding these facts, which our own experience and a mass of authority might swell to a volume: but it convinces us of the  necessity of cleanliness, ventilation, and precaution.  Another important fact admitted by Dr. Rush, is one furnished him by Dr. Otto: viz.—"In the autumn of the year  1798, it (a malignant remittent fever) prevailed upon the  shores of the Delaware, in Gloucester county, New Jersey.  A mild Remittent prevailed, at the same lime, on the high  grounds, a few miles from the river. During this time, the  Doctor observed, if a poison who bad taken the yellow fever  in Philadelphia, afterwards came into a family near the river,  the same disease appeared, in several instances, in one or  more branches of that family: but where persons brought  the fever from the city, and went into a family on the high  grounds, where the mild remittents prevailed, there was not a  single instance of a yellow fever having been excited by them  in any of its members." Med. Repos. v. G, p. 1G0. This  is an important admission, and one which every unprejudiced  person, who has been conversant with yellow fever, will also  idmit: and in substance it is precisely what I contend for;  viz: that, in an infectious air, yellow fever may spread, without proper care. And Dr. Rush further says, that "the city  of Philadelphia has furnished, in all our yellow fever years,  many additional proofs of the correctness of Dr. Otto's remarks " What is it but personal infection, added to an infectious state ofthe atmosphere? For when, as Dr. R. observes,  the atmosphere is highly infectious, or "charged with the  miasmatic effluvia, or ' pestilential exhalations,' a single ease  of yellow fever will excite it in a whole family."  Ibid. p. IGO.  Dr. Tilton, an old physician of great celebrity, during and  soon after the revolutionary war, in speaking of the yellow  fever which prevailed at Wilmington, Delaware, August,  1798, says, "no one doubted it having been brought from  Philadelphia, in infectious or bad air, in boat;, shallops,"  etc. He says it began about the water's edge, and spread  gradually up to tho highest streets: having first appeared  early in August, it became epidemic by the middle of September.* Dr. Geo. Monroe, speaking of the same epidemic,  says it was clearly traced to an infected vessel from Philadelphia, then at the wharf, and that part of tho town near the  wharf suffered most severely.! The atmosphere being in a  suitable condition for propagating the disease, the air from the  vessels acted as a leaven. It must be borne in mind, that these  facts arc not adduced as evidences of contagion, nor do the  persons who detail them consider them as evidences of contagion, but as showing clearly that the bad, infected air of  diips, as well as other localities, may be so diffused about a  &gt;',  II  :,'i  1  A  ..i  ,1  ■J''  k .,  I  '.,'' I  4  ■   I  I.  ,i  ■Med.

When it falls upon  the ground it begins to decline and finally dies, if not destroyed by cattle and other stock.  I have seen it, though very seldom, attached by roots to the  hark of the tree upon which it was found ; but it was only in  those hist! nces in which a fibre became confined by the growing of the coarse bark of the tree and was thus compelled to  take root in the interstices of the bark. From this attacl:  ment it has seemed to derive nutriment only to that portion  near the rooty attachment, where it was luxurient and branch  incr- the remainder being as usual. For, deriving sustenance  from the air, it is provided with numerous glandular scales or  lamella; projecting out from the whole extent of the leaves  and stem. These may be seen with the naked eye ; but with  a microscope they appear projecting from the stein, like the  leaves from the stalk of mullicn, but proportionably shorter.  Between them also are seen many fine brown spots or pores,  which appear, when seen through a microscope, like large  apertures with a raised margin and centre, and around the  centre in the groove between it and the margin are perceived  a or 0 small apertures or pores, penetrating the substance of  the stem. These are doubtless glands or pores by which  they derive their nutriment from the damp air.  This moss is evidently an evergreen and grows most  in the damp warm weather of winter :* although it grows  also in summer. Cold winters injure it, and very severe cold destroys its luxurience. It blossoms late in  die spring and in summer; and bears a small bell-shaped  (lower, about the size of the small ground daisies. These  flowers grow solitary and sesile in the axillas between the  leaves and branches of the main stem. The flower is succeeded by a one-celled, trivalvcd capsule, about half a line in  thickness and one inch in length, and sometimes less; this  capsule contains from five to twenty small oat-shaped seeds  from one, to one and a half lines in length, and about one fifth  or one sixth of a line in thickness.  The seeds arc closely imbeded in the upper extremity °f  tin: capsule; and each is attached to the extremity of -c filament or stipe; this filament or stipe is inserted into -'he receptacle by a small pedicel provided with an ogre.' of 20 or 30  remarkably fine silky fibres, from five to seivn lines in length;  also each seed, at the opposite end of the filament or stripe, is  provided with a similar fine pappus of silky fibres nearly ns  long as those of tho egret. These silky capillaries are remarkably apt to attach themselves and hold to any thing  rough, Hence when wafted by currents of air they readily  attach themselves to the bark of trees, where they germinate  and grow. The egret and pappus upon the seed doubly  ensure its attachment to the bark and branches of almost every  kind of trees.  The seed matures late in the fall, when the capsules burst  ami the seeds, by means of their egrets and pappus become  disseminated by the winds.    During a  warm damp winter,  ' Ii win i,e remembered Hint our winters Instead of being seasons of extreme  cold, nn- often rather seasons ofwet weather—Hie thermometer sometimes rang.  'ni! from lo° to 75° of Fahrenheit in December mid January ; and but very sel  dom below ao« Fahrenheit.  these seeds will produce a short bud of the moss from one  fourth of an inch to one inch in length, of the same color and  appearance as the leaf of the moss.  This vegetable, although in appearance composed of large  bunches or tangled tresses, when each single plant seperated  to itself, consists of a long fiextious stem, from six inches to  five feet in length, of a greyish green or grey appearance,  with dichotomous and trichotomous leavesor frond lets putting  out from the main stem every three or four inches, each leaf  being from half an inch to one and a half inches in length and  subulate. About every eight or ten inches, and sometimes  less it sends off a lateral branch, which like the main stem  grows annually, and sends forth other branches and leaves.  The main stem as it bangs suspended across the slender  branches of trees, grows Irom both extremities, while the  lateral branches can grow at one end only. The long fresses  which cover the forest trees are made up of several separate  plants intertangled and intertwined together; all hanging  down together with their leaves and lateral branches of different lengths, cause them to appear like amorphous masses of  fibres and ends.  The extent to which these branches grow in any given  time is not known to the writer; but it js probable that the  branches do not grow more than two or three inches in one  year, if so much. I have seen the young shoots from the  seed not more than an inch long, which were probably the  growth of one year; others which were from two to six  ncbes, were probably the growth of two or three years;  those of four or five feet in length are probably the growth of  half an age.  1 have seen germs of moss in January, not more than one  tenth of an inch long, growing out of the seed; and this I  suppose was the growth from the fall seed which bad matured  one or two months-before; as other seeds which had not escaped from the capsules had not sprouted at all, or very slightly.  Each stem or principal branch after one year's growth contains- hi the centre, a small black fibre, knotted or jointed at  .•he points where the branches and leaves put forth. When  the epidermis or bark is detached or rotted off, it leaves a  black knotted fibre not unlike coarse curled or knotted horse  hair, and when in masses it resembles masses of Ihe same,  knotted and intimately tangled together. In the South, these  fibrous matters are used for the purposes for which hair, straw,  and wool, are used at the North, in the manufacture of cushions, mattresses, pads, and harness padding, and for these purposes it is even more valuable than hair or straw. Nearly  all the mattresses and summer beds in the South are made of  this valuable article. M.  Washington, Miss., Jan. 31st, 1838.  THE SOUNDING MOUNTAIN.

They contend, that the infection, or infected air, of ships and  other places, will diffuse itself, and produce disease in those  who breathe it, provided the general atmosphere in which  they live is highly morbific, or predisposing lo disease, but  that it will not otherwise: that when such a condition of air  exists, the infection will gradually spread, and finally, without  a change of weather, produce an epidemic: and that, in a  healthy state of the air, this infected air, or infection, docs not  extend itself. * That a ship, when so infected with yellow  lever miasm, maybe as much a source of miasm, or that it  may be disseminated from a ship upon the contiguous population, ns well as from a pile of oysters, or putrid colfee, or  any other source of miasm. That this infected air from ships,  in a healthy state of the atmosphere, will not produce the (lis  case in those near the wharf where it lies, unless they go on  board; or it will not infect the contiguous atmosphere, unless  that asmospbere be highly contaminated, and havo already  predisposed the population to disease. -Dr. Rush, ami others,  who were compelled to admit these facts, affirm that this infected air acts only as an exciting cause; and that, in this respect, it sustains tho same position that dissipation, exposure,  fatigue, and the like, sustain to disease. We do not object to  this either; but if it thus becomes an exciting cause, which  is unavoidable, and produces or excites disease in those who  would avoid the other exciting causes, it is certainly as much  to bo deprecated as if it were called by another name; for it  causes tho death of those who might otherwise escape.  Another great point of difference among medical men, is  in relation to ihe source or origin of the malaria of yellow-  fever, as an epidemic. As to its nature or properties, as before observed, we know nothing except by its effects upon the  human system. It is an invisible, inodorous, aerial poison,  which cannot be perceived by any of our senses; and has not  been detected by any chemical analysis. Yet most men seem to  look for it in the fetor which arises from the piitrifaction of  animal and vegetable substances: and these substances nre  looked upon as the only true source of the miasm of yellow-  fever. Hence, whenever yellow fever makes its appearance  in any portion of a city, they immediately commence a search  for the source of the infectious miasm ; and the first matters  of the animal or vegetable kingdoms, in a slate of decomposition, with which they meet, are at once unequivocally declared as the source of the pestilential miasm. If nothing  purely animal or vegetable be found in a state of piitrifaction, they seize upon whatever, in their opinion, is most nearly  allied to them. And this continues to be the case, notwithstanding these foetid effluvia have been tested, ami found lo  contain no principle particularly deleterious to health: each  one, in reference to the cause of an epidemic, looks alone to  those matters which are most offensive to their olfactories;  notwithstanding experience leaches that the infected atmosphere cannot be distinguished from common air, by any of  our senses. In searching out the source of this disease,' instead of being directed by reason and experience, it is too fre-  quently the case, that they are "led by the nose" alone; and  ■fled, Rep. vol. 3,p.800,  where nothing olsc can be found sufficient, all the pestilence  is traced to a filthy back yard, a wet sewer, a dead rat, or a  rotten potatoe.

Hcxaudria Monogynia.    Linn.  Specific Name—UsNEOlDBS. From vma a. genus of  lichens, and ctl»s likeness—from its supposed resemblance ,o  the Usnea family. The resemblance is very remote and the  name but little applicable.  Specific Characters. Plant Southern, parasitic, perennial.  Stem greyish green, pruinose to the naked eye, filiform,  branching, pendulous, fiexuoso or slightly spiral, about one  third of a line in thickness, and from a few inches to six feel  long; leaves same size and color with the main stem, cauline,  subulate, in pairs or trios, and from one to two inches long:  when two leaves are opposite, the main stem passes through  a spathe formed by their bases, although they are sesile:  flowers bell-tubular, solitary, and axillary, petals 3, light green,  broad-linear, rounded at the apex, etpiitant below, thereby  forming u tube equal to the calyx: calyx, rusty, glabrous,  tripartite, divisions subulate, very acute, erect, spreading Dal:  stamens shorter than the tube.  Eaton has placed it among those plants whose corals have a  perianth without a spathe:—but the coral of the Spanish  moss has a calyx, and a spathe over it; and the spathe remains or is permanent.  This singular vegetable abounds along the lower Mississippi, principally upon the alluvial lands, nnd the contiguous fertile hills, within 10 or 15 miles of the river. It seems  to flourish best in a damp atmosphere and in regions where  fogs are frequent, which is the case in the swamps of the  Mississippi, and many other portions of the South and Southwest. In high, thin or sterile hills, remote from the river, or  from marshy grounds, it is less frequent and often entitelj  wanting. It seldom is found North of 33° or 33.1° N, lot  In a suitable atmosphere it abounds to such an extent, that  nearly all the trees of the forest, which have rough bark, are  covered with heavy tresses of it, from ono to six feet long.  lendnnt from every branch, until the whole forest appeals  'lad in sombre grey ; which in tho leafless period of wintet  casts a more gloomy shade in the deep forest than common  foliage does in summer.  This plant, although a parasite, derives no sustenance from  the tree upon which it hangs. The only support, yielded ly  the tree, is to hold it suspended from its fine branches, so thai  ii may wave freely in the air and be exposed to every breeze,  from which only it derives its sustenance, It will grow upon  dead trees, as I have seen a hundred times; but it doesK*  flourish there as upon tho living tree, for want of the small  branches to suspend it loosely in the air; for these are soon  dropped by dead trees;  and even the large  branches upon  A 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/443	443	444.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/444.jp2

When it falls upon  the ground it begins to decline and finally dies, if not destroyed by cattle and other stock.  I have seen it, though very seldom, attached by roots to the  bark of the tree upon which it was found ; but it was only in  those instr nces in which a fibre became confined by the grow  jno- of the coarse bark of the tree and was thus compelled to  take root in the interstices of the bark. From this attach  ment it has seemed to derive nutriment only to that portion  near the rooty attachment, where it was luxurient and branch  incr- the remainder being as usual. For, deriving sustenance  from the air, it is provided with numerous glandular scales or  lamellae, projecting out from tho whole extent of the leaves  and stem. These may be seen with the naked eye ; but with  a microscope they appear projecting from the stem, like the  leaves from Iho stalk of mullicn, but proportionably shorter.  Between them also are seen many fine brown spots or pores,  which appear, when seen through a microscope, like large  apertures with a raised margin and centre, and around the  centre in the groove between it and the margin are perceived  nor 15 small apertures or pores, penetrating the substance of  the stem. These are doubtless glands or pores by which  they derive their nutriment from the damp air.  This moss is evidently an evergreen and grows most  in the damp warm weather of winter :* although it grows  also in summer. Cold winters injure it, and very severe cold destroys its luxurienco. It blossoms late in  die spring and in summer; and bears a small bell-shaped  flower, about the size of the small ground daisies. These  flowers grow solitary and sesile in the axillas between the  leaves and branches of the main stem. The flower is succeeded by a one-celled, trivalvcd capsule, about half a line in  thickness and one inch in length, and sometimes less; this  capsule contains from five to twenty small oat-shaped seeds  from one, to one and a half lines in length, and about one fifth  or one sixth of a line in thickness. ]  The seeds are closely imbeded in the upper extremity of  ihe capsule; and each is attached to the extremity of--c filament or stipe; this filament or stipe is inserted into the receptacle by a small pedicel provided with an egret of 20 or 30  remarkably fine silky fibres, from five to seven lines in length;  also each seed, at the opposite end of the filament or stripe, is  provided with a similar fine pappus of silky fibres nearly as  long as those of the egret.    These silky capillaries are re  markably apt to attach themselves and hold to any thing  rough. Hence when wafted by currents of air they readily  attach themselves to the bark of trees, where they germinate  and grow. The egret and pappus upon the seed doubly  ensure its attachment to the bark and branches of almost every  kind of trees.  The seed matures late in the fall, when the capsules burst  ami llic seeds, by means of their egrets and pappus become  disseminated by the winds.    During a  warm damp winter,  ' It will l,c remembered that our winters instead of being seasons of extreme  cold, sre often rathe, seasons of wet weather—the thermometer sometimes rang;,  tnj from 46* to 75° of Fahrenheit In December and January; and but very sel  dom below 20= Fahrenheit.  these seeds will produce a short bud of the moss from one  fourth of an inch lo one inch in length, of the same color and  appearance as the leaf of the moss.  This vegetable, although in appearance composed of large  bunches or tangled tresses, when e'ach single plant seperated  to itself, consists of a long flexuous stem, from six inches to  five feet in length, of a greyish green or grey appearance,  with dichotomous and trichotomous leaves or frondletsputting  out from the main stem every three or four inches, each leaf  being from half an inch to one and a half inches in length and  subulate. About every eight or ten inches, and sometimes  less it sends off a lateral branch, which like the main stem  grows annually, and sends forth other branches and leaves.  The main stem as it hangs suspended across the slender  branches of trees, grows from both extremities, while tho  lateral branches can grow at one end only. The long tresses  which cover the forest trees are made up of several separato  plants intertangled and intertwined together; all hanging  down together with their leaves and lateral branches of different lengths, cause them to appear like amorphous masses of  fibres and ends.  The extent to which these branches grow in any given  time is not known to the writer; but it js probable that the  branches do not grow more than two or three inches in one  year, if so much. I have seen the young shoots from the  seed not more than an inch long, which were probably the  growth of one year; others which were from two to six  nches, wero probably the growth of two or three years;  those of four or five feet in length are probably the growth of  half an age.  1 have seen germs of moss in January, not more than one  tenth of an inch long, growing out of the seed; nnd this I  suppose was the growth from the fall seed which had matured  one or two months before; as other seeds which had not escaped from the capsules had not sprouted at all, or very slightly.  Each stem or principal branch after ono year's growth contain? in the centre, a small black fibre, knotted or jointed at  l.'fie points where the branches and leaves put forth. When  the epidermis or bark is detached or rotted off, it leaves a  black knotted fibre not unlike coarse curled or knotted horse  hair, and when in masses it resembles masses of the same,  knotted antl intimately tangled together. In the South, these  fibrous matters are used for the purposes for which hair, straw,  and wool, are used at the North, in the manufacture of cushions, maltresses, pads, and harness padding, and for these purposes it is even more valuable than hair or straw. Nearly  all the mattresses and summer beds in the South are made of  this valuable article. M.  Washington, Miss., Jan. 31st, 1838.  Jfc  THE SOUNDING MOUNTAIN.

A solid slope of the finest sand drifts and extends on  the sea face from the base to the summit (about six hundred  feet) ut an angle of about 40 degrees with tho horizon.  This is encircled or rather semicircled, if the term is allowable, by a ridge of sandstone rocks rising up in a pointed  pinnacle, and presenting little surface adapted for forming an  echo. It is remarkable that there are several other slopes  similar to this, but the sounding or rumbling, as it has been  called, is confined to this alone. We dismounted from our  camels and remained at the base while a Bedouin scrambled  up. We did no' hear the sound until he had attained a considerable height. The sound then began rolling down, and  it commenced a strain resembling the first notes of an yEolian  harp, or the fingers wetted and drawn over glass—increasing  in loudness as the sand reached the base, when it was almost  equal to thunder.  It reached the rock on which wc were seated, and caused  our frightened camels (animals you know not easily alarmed)  to start off    1 was perfectly astounded, as was Capt.  M   and the rest of the party. 1 had visited it before in the winter month, but the sound was then so faint as to be barely  evident. But now the scorching heat of the sun had dried  the sand and permitted it lo roll down in large quantities. I  cannot now form the most remote conjecture as to the cause  of it. We must not, I find now, refer it to the sand falling  into a hollow; that might produce a sound, but could never  cause the prolonged vibrations, as it were, of some huge harp  string, I shall not venture on any speculation, but, having  carefully noted the facts, I shall lay them, on my arrival in  England, before some wiser head than my own, and sec if he  can make any thing out ofHHem."  WASHINGTON'S LIFE-GUARD.—THE PASSAGE OF THE  SCHUYLKILL.  the Cit-tii Recollection  ui.l Prlvnl  of Washh  Memoirs of lite ljf„ „„,] (.-|ia  Tin- life-guard was a major's command. Oibbs ol Rhode  Island, a gallant officer, and celebrated martinet, Major Colfax  a line young man from New-Jersey, and much esteemed in  the army, Captains Grymes and Nicholas, of Virginia, brave  and valued officers, lieutenant and ensign, with one hundred  and eighty picked men, rank and file. The uniform, blue  with white facings, white under-clothes, and black gaiters.  The horse-guard was detailed from various corps during  the contest. In the earlier campaigns, from Baylor's regi  ment, which was called Lady Washington's Dragoons—  uniform white, with blue facings, &c. The life-guard, al  ways attached to the head quarters, was admired as well fo  its superior appearance as for its high state of discipline, it being considered, in the olden time, a matter of distinction to  serve in the guard of tho Commander-in-chief.  The life-guard was borrowed by favorite officers for several  important expeditions. In the affair of Barren Hill, May,  '78, the life-guard formed a part of the troops under the Marquis de Lafayette, who, recovered of the wound he received  in the preceding campaign, in '78 made his debut in arms as a  general officer. The position of Barren Hill becoming extremely hazardous, on account of two heavy columns of the  enemy that were marching to intercept the communication of  the Marepiis wilh the main army at Valley Forge, the young  General determined, by a gallant dash between the advancing  lolumns, to reach the ford on the Schuylkill, and thus secure  lis retreat to the main army. Hero let our narration pause,  while we pay a well-merited tribute to the memory and services of Allen McLane, to whose untiling vigilance in watch,  ing the stealthy approach of the enemy's columns toward  Barren Hill, and promptness in attacking them on their route,  the Marquis was mainly indebted for success in the celebrated  retreat that shed such lustre on bis first command.  In Allen McLane, wo have the recollection of a partisan  who, with genius to conceive, possessed a courage even to  chivalry to execute, the most daring enterprises; who ever  ranked with the foremost in the esteem of the chief, and was  considered by the whole army as one ofthe most intrepid mil  distinguished officers of the war of the Revolution.  When the retiring Americans reached the ford of the  Schuylkill, they hesitated in attempting the passage. Lafayette sprang from his horse, rushed into the water waist deep,  calling on his comrades to follow. Animated by the example  of their youthful General, the soldiers entered the river, the  taller men sustaining the shorter, and after a severe struggle  gained the southern or friendly shore, having suffered but inconsiderable loss.  Meanwhile, the enemy were inclose pursuit, and the commander-in-chief fearing for the detachment, which consisted  of his choicest troops, including the life-guard, dragged his  artillery to the rocky heights that commanded the ford, ami  opened upon the enemy's advance, checking them so far as lo  enablethe Marquis the better to secure bis retreat; and there  was one feature in the martial spectacle of the passage to the  Schuylkill of rare and imposing interest: it was the admired  form of Washington, at times obscured, and then beheld amid  the smoke of the cannonade, as, attended by his generals and  staff, he would waive his hat to encourage the soldiers in their  perilous passage of the stream.  On the morning of the battle of Monmouth, June, '78, a  detachment from the life-guard, and one from Morgan's riflemen, lodhy Morgan's favorite, Captain Gabriel Long, made  a brilliant dash at a party ofthe enemy which they surprised  while washing nt a brook that ran through an extensive  meadow. Seventeen grenadiers were made prisoners, anil  borne off in the very face of the British light infantry, who  fired upon their daring assailants, and immediately commenced a hot pursuit; yet Long displayed such consummate  ability as well as courage, that he brought off his party, prisoners and all, with only the loss of one sergeant wounded.  Morgan was in waiting, at the out-post, to receive the detachment on their return, having listened, with much anxiety,  to the heavy fire of the pursuing enemy. Charmed withthe  success of the enterprise, in the return of tho troops almost  unharmed, and in the prisoners taken, Morgan wrung the favorite captain by the hand, paid bis compliments to the officers and men of his own corps, and of the life-guard, and tli'11  the filmed Leader of the Woodsmen indulged himself in I  stentorian laugh that made all ring again, at the bespattered  condition of the gentlemen, as he was pleased to term the life 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/445	445	446.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/446.jp2

The New York Sunday Morning News justly remarks:  —" i-i' it be the peculiar province of poetry to give delight,  this author should rank very high among poets; and, in spite  of his neglect of the terrible passions, he does rank very  high in our estimation. He has a beautiful fancy, and a beautiful diction, and a fine ear for the music of verse, and great  tenderness nnd delicacy of feeling. He seems, moreover, to  be altogether free fpon my tincture of bitterness, rancor, or  jealousy; and never 3I10       us &gt;vith atrocity, or stiffens tis  with horror. His soul, on the contrary, seems filled to overflowing with images of love, and beauty, and gentle sorrows,  and tender pity, and mild and holy resignation. The character of his poetry is to soothe, melt, and delight: to make us  hind, and thoughtful, and imaginative; to purge away the  dregs of our earthly passions, by the refining (ires of a pure  imagination, and to wrap us up from tho eating cares of life,  in visions so soft and bright, as to sink like morning dreams  on our senses, at the same time so distinct and truly fashioned  upon the eternal patterns of nature, as to hold their place be-  foro our eyes long after they have again been opened upon  the dimmer scenes of the world. Here is the latest of his  poems, entitled,  AN  INCIDENT   AT   SORRENTO.  DY  WM.   CUM.KN  BRYANT.  Fair is thy site, Sorrento! green thy shore!  Black crdgs behind thee pierce the clear blue skies,  The sea, whose borders ruled the world of yore,  As clear, and bluer still, before thee lies.  Vesuvius smokes in sight, whose fount of fire,  Out gtishihg, drowned the cities on his sleeps;  And murmuring Naples, spire o'er topping spire,  Sits on the slope beyond, where Virgil sleeps.  Here doth the earth, with flowers of every line  Heap her green breast, when April's sun isbright—  Flowers of the inorning-red, or ocean-blue,  Or, like the mountain frost, of silvery white.  Currents of fragraner from ihe orange tree,  And sward oi' violets, breathing to and fro,  Mingle, and wandering out upon the sea,  Refresh the idle boatman where they blow.  Ycl even here, as under harsher climes,  Tears o'er the loved and early lost are shed,  That soft air saddens with the funeral chimes,  Those shining llowersare gathered for the dead.  Here once a child, a playful, smiling one,  All the day long caressing nnd caressed,  Died, when his little tongue had just begun  To lisp the names of those he loved the best.  The father strove his struggling grief to quell;  The mother wept, as mothers use to weep;  Two little sisters wearied them to tell  When their dear Carlo woidd awake from ulce-p.  Within an inner room hisconeU they spread,  His funeral couch; with mingled grief and love,  They laid a crown »( roses on his head,  And murmured, "brighter is his crown above."  They scattered round him, on his snowy sheet,  Laburnum's strings of sunny-eoloieagems,  Sad hyacinth and violet dim and sweet,  And orange blossoms on their dark green stems!  And now the hoar is come—the priest is there—  Torches arc lit—the bells are tolled—they go,  With solemn rites of blessing and of prayer,  To lay those dear remains in earth below.  The door is opened—hark that quick glad cry—  " Carlo has waked—has waked, and is at play I "  The little sisters leap, and laugh, and try  To climb the couch on which the infant lay.  1  ■m  $1  :;i|-*|  mm  ■ I  if  m  ■:      h  l_  ■  I  I  :; ?!  h 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/446	446	447.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/447.jp2

BY  A  LADY.  ■Then Is nothing bcatcUM hut mind."—Miss IUyxm.  It is mind that gives us hope,—hope of Heaven; that  must elevate us with the angels; that teaches us his will  whom we are to serve; to estimate the boundless extent of  his ever-saving mercy; to estimate the justice of an awful  sentence on a disobedient, fallen race, and the extent of that  love that gave an only son to die, that we might live, and preserve his law unbroken!  It is mind that teaches us to love and serve him; that calls  forth every emotion of devotion from the grateful heart, and  teaches us to look with impatience for the day, when each  shall account for the talents with which he hasbecn entrusted,  and shall receive his reward accordingly. It is this mysterious emanation that leads us from depth to height, and over  endless space, culling, abstracting, combining, and seeking,  THE THEORY OF WARM  CURRENTS  OF AIR.  The philosophical fact, that warm currents of air are frequently encountered in many parts of our country, generally  during the latter part of the day, or at night-fall, was stated  by Jefferson, in his celebrated notes on Virginia. His investigating mind did not attempt to account for them, and the  cause that produced them has been variously defined.  These warm currents of air are generally so rapid in their  passage, and so transient in their stay, that they usually fail to  alfect the most sensitive thermometers, although they are  singularly palpable to the senses. One, in walking half a  mile after sundown, will often cross the path of half a dozen  of these gushes of warm air, which seem to be gathered in  masses of definite strata or formations.  A late writer on Meteorological phenomena, in the Knickerbocker, ascribes these currents to the aggregating nature ol  ;aloric, disposing it to move in massrs, while in the act of being dissipated through the atmosphere. The unequal action  of the son, upon different portions of the atmosphere, towards  night, when its relative position throws direct quantities of  loric upon portions of air, while it is withdrawn from  others, may account for the unequal temperature of aerial  strata, which require some houis after dark to equalize.  The writer, to whom we allude, traces some affinity between the warm, atmospheric currents and the phenomena of  electricity ; and supposes that the warmer and colder strata of  the air may have something the same relation to each other  as the electric positive and negative.    He also supposes that  J. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/447	447	448.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/448.jp2

The "Richmond Lyceum," in Virginia, has resolved to  establish a monthly publication, to be styled " The Journal of  the Richmond Lycc nm," We shall take the privilege of an  elder sister, and introduce our younger, and, perhaps, more  interesting relative, to " good society" in the South on her  first appearance.  MORAL GREATNESS.  We can conceive of no nobler attitude of moral greatness,  than that assumed by a generous, noble-minded spirit, in the  midst of personal danger, surrounded by scenes of death and  suffering, tenderly sensible of all, nnd yet, seemingly, only  actuated by the motives of an unconquerable benevolence  towards others. Such was the attitude of the late Alfred  Cochran during the recent epidemic in the city of Natchez.  We shall enter upon no eulogy of the departed. His own  words will best explajn his position, as we quote them from a  letter, addressed to his father, only a day or two previous tu  his sickness, which proved fatal.    He writes:—  " With regard lo our own town, I can say, I am sick at  heart, when 1 see and hear of SO much suffering.  "The fever docs not abate: it is worse. The number of  deaths, the last week, is greater than before; our fair little  city, formerly the seat of health, life, and profitable business  at this season, seems now but the abode of sorrow and death.  My position as Chairman of the Committee of Health, prevents my going wholly from town, and makes me acquainted  with the progress of the disease, which is very fatal among  strangers.  "God, in his great mercy, has spared me and mine thus  thee, and that those comforts we have in each other may be  daily increased, as far as they may be pleasing to God. I will  use that speech to thee, that Abigail did to David :—' I will be  a servant to wash the feet of my lord.' I will do any service  wherein I may please my good husband. I confess I cannot  do enough for thee ; but thou art pleased to accept the will for  the deed, and rest contented.  " I have many reasons to make me love thee, whereof I  will name two :—first, because thou lovest God; and,secondly, because thou lovest me. If these two were wanting, all  the rest would be eclipsed. But I must leave this discourse,  and go about my household affairs. I am a bad housewife,  to be so long from them; but I must needs borrow a little  time to talk wilh thee, my sweet heart. I hope thy business  draws to an end. It will be but two or three weeks before I  see thee, though they be long ones. God will bring us together in his good lime; for which time I shall pray. Farewell, my good husband ; the Lord keep thee.  Your obedient wife,  Margaret Winthrop.  SKETCH.  The Character of Joseph WolIT, Iho Missionary, as sketched hy the Krr.

"If any thing could teach the preenriousness of life, the  impotence of all human effort, and folly of pride, it would  be such scenes as are around us."  A  MATRIMONIAL LOVE LETTER OF 1028.  [The liillowing letter was written to the first governor of  the colony of Massachusetts Bay, by his wife, about the year  li3~8; and is a lino specimen of the expressed feelings of  married love.]  "My jiost sweet husband:—How dearly welcom  thy kind letter was to me, I am not able to express.

When I should  have addressed him in Syria, I heard of him at Malta, and  when I supposed he was gone to England, he was riding, like  a ruling angel on the whirlwinds of Antioch, or standing  unappalled among the crumbling towers of Aleppo. A man  who at Rome calls the Pope "the dust of the earth," and  tells the Jews at Jerusalem, that "the Gemara is a lie"—  who passes his days in disputation, and his nights in digging  the Talmud—lo whom a floor of brick is a feather-bed, and  a box a bolster—who makes or finds a friend in the persecutor of his present or former faith—who can conciliate a Pacha  or confute a Patriarch—who travels without a guide, speaks  without an interpreter, can live without fuud, and pay without money—forgiving all the insults he meets with, and forgetting all the flattering he receives—who knows little of  worldly conduct, and yet accommodates himself to all men,  without giving offence to any. Such a man (and such and  more is Wolff) must excite no ordinary attention in a country nnd among a people (the Jews) whose monotony of manners and habits has remained undisturbed for centuries. As  a pioneer, I deem him matchless. "Ant inveniel viarn, ant  faciei."—but if order is to be established, or arrangements  made,—trouble not Wolff—he is devoid of enmity to man,  and full of the Love of God.  Errata.—In the last number of the Journal, (No.4,) in consequence of the illegibility of the manuscript, and of the author's not  having seen the proof, there were a few material errors in Professor Wyche's essay.  Page 56, 13th line from the top of second column, for "sound,"  read clause.  Page OS,8th line from ton, 2d column,for " highest," read bright.  "    " 14th"     "     " " for" even," read tooe.  Besides the above, there are minor literal errors, which it would  be as unjust to the reader to suppose he could not coirect, as to the  author lo suppose that he could make them.  - ' %  If  mm  ■' '  £«■  11   . »vl  ml  S ■■■•]  ill  ■« .  tj .  11 '.'.  •W 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/448	448	449.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/449.jp2

An ErK*y read before Hie. Jefferson College and Washington Lyceum, Dee. 2,  1837, by J. YV. Monette, M. U.  CONTINUED.  As wo before observed, the immediate cause of yellow  fever as an epidemic, is a subtle gaseous poison in the atmosphere : but how it is generated, or from what it is thrown  off, we are not certainly informed.   The medical faculty have  been constantly engaged in efforts to detect ils origin and explain its nature; they have manifested zeal and industry worthy  the cause of science, to search out and expound the hidden, il  not mysterious cause.    In unnumbered instances, they have  supposed they had traced the monster to his den : but when  they have attempted to place the shackles upon him, he has  vanished.    The difficulty of arriving at the true knowledge  of such a mysterious agent, has only stimulated the zeal, and  excited the industry of the medical faculty, whose province  is to search out the physical causes of morbid phenomena.  Hence (he great diversity of opinions entertained and advanced on the origin of this pestilential miasm.    At one time  it has been traced successfully, as was believed, to putrefying  mid putrid vegetable matter, sometimes of one kind, and sometimes ol another.    At another time, it has been as clearly  traced to putrescent animal matters of one kind or another:  at another time, it has been as clearly traced to the union of  animal and vegetable matter in a state of putrefaction; at another time, it has been traced as clearly to a source differing  widely from either,  and  apparently entirely independent of  all o[ them; at another time, it has been traced to some atmospheric phenomena, independent of any cause under our  control; at another time, it has been traced to increased and  continued temperature of the seasons; at another to vicissitudes of weather, which were perceptible to our senses, as  changes from heat to cold and rice versa; and, at another  time, lo changes of which we can form no definite idea, such  as a mysterious epidemic constitution of the atmosphere.  Other circumstances, again, have carried, as was believed, incon-  testible evidence that it has originated from personal contagion  ttlone; others, again, seem to show, that personal contagion  lias no agency in the matter, but that it is a poisonous air gen  crated in ships at sea, with or without putrescency.    In every  instance, tho facts and arguments arrayed to sustain one theory, have militated equally against all others; and thus of each  in turn; so that nearly every theory is opposed, if not controverted by all the others: and whatever ground is taken, there  is ten to one against it.    Under these circumstances, we must  take a middle course; for, although it is not probable that all  are true in the whole, it is equally improbable that all should  be entirely erroneous.    All these different circumstances or  relations may have had some agency, at different times, in  modifying the action of the poisonous miasm: although all ot  them certainly could not have been actual sources for its production. Some of these circumstances may have increased  or diminished the susceptibility of the system to its action, or  so modified it as to render its effects apparently moro or legs  direct from the efficient malaria.  Great solar heat is one circumstance which invariably precedes, and is certainly an essential requisite to generate the  miasm or infection of yellow fever; and the fact that the absence of heat, or cold, as invariably destroys it, shows that its  production is effected by some unknown combination of solar  heat, with some unknown principle in the atmosphere; and  we infer that the numerous other sources to which it has been  ascribed, have had their agency only in modifying the effects  of this poison on the human system. To enter into a detailed  explanation of the manner in which these various causes may  effect the susceptibility of the system, is beyond our present  purpose. We will only remark briefly on some of tho most  prominent theories, in relation to the source and production of  this miasm, or malarious poison.  Those who contend for its origin in vegetable putrefaction,  have ascribed it to putrid codec, to putrid potatoes, to putrid  oranges, to rotten corn, to putrid sour crout, sour porter, and  the like; in warehouses, on board ships, or lying exposed  upon tho wharves.  Those who believe it originates from animal putrcfaetion,  have ascribed it to the opening of old burial grounds, to putrid fish, to putrid bacon, to putrid pork, to putrid animal carcases, to putrid hides, to putrid oysters, and to similar matters  discovered about the wharves and shipping, or in other parts  of cities.  Those who contend for its origin in effluvia generated by  the sun from the surface of the earth, have ascribed it to exhalations from stagnant water in marshes; to the exhalations of  marshy ground, when all moisture is evaporated; to exhalations thrown off by loose earth exposed to the sun; to exhalations thrown off by mud, and common city filth, in sewers  and back yards; and, when these are wanting, to any thing  their fancy may suggest.  Those who believe it to originate in sensible changes ofthe-  atmosphere, have ascribed it to a dry, heated air; to moisf  heated air; to a continued mean temperature at or above 80" for  forty days together; to sudden vicissitudes from hot to cool  weather, and the reverse; to the absence or presence of much  electricity in the atmosphere, and absence of thunder, dee.;  others ascribe it to a peculiar insensible " epidemic constitution" of the atmosphere.  To nearly all of these causes have the yellow fevers of  Natchez been ascribed, by the advocates of those different  theories; and each have adduced certain facts to sustain their  opinions. Upon each of which we shall make a few remarks',  and pass on to the history of the epidemics of Natchez.  1st.    Of animal putrefaction.

Vi;ft.  t  I i'.'l  on yellow fever, to prepare the way for establishing his theory of marsh-miasni, has adduced an array of facts and evidence incontrovertible, proving that animal putrefaction may  exist to any extent, and tinder all circumstances, without producing yellow fever; and consequently, that it is not a iicces-  sarysource of the miasm; and that, of course, yellow fever  miasm is, or may be, produced from some other cause. He  has shown, that this kind of putrefaction, is not even a frequent concurring circumstance; nnd that animal putrefaction  has existed in cities, and other localities, under the most favor  able circumstances for its production, according to that doc  trine, without having produced yellow fever, either epidemic  ally or sporadically, lie has shown conclusively, that pit  tried pork, putrid bacon, putrid fish, &c., fresh or salted, will  not generate this miasm ; nor will dead bodies of any kind,  without salt, in a putrescent state, produce it; not even the putrefaction of human bodies, by hundreds, upon the burning  sands and marshes of Egypt; nor is il produced by the intolerable stench produced and kept up by animal matters in  cities, or about factories of glue and catgut; about butcheries,  tanneries, chandleries, &c. These facts, which are incontrovertible, all confirm the opinion sanctioned by experience,  that the miasm or infection of yellow fever, be it what it may,  is not, in any sense, dependent upon, or connected with tho  fcetor of animal putrefaction, either in its incipient state, or in  a state of complete decomposition. It has been placed beyond  doubt, that the miasm, or infection of yellow fever, has been  generated abundantly in the holds of ships at sea, where no  putrid animal or vegetable matters have existed; a good example of this kind is found in Ihe United Slates brig "Enterprise," hereafter referred to. There arc cities or towns in the  tropics, where abundance of putrid animal and vegetable  matters are combined with effluvia from mud and marshy bottoms of shallow harbors, and yet they enjoy uninterrupted  health: an example of this kind is found in the town of ('am-  peachey hereafter cited.  2d. Of vegetable putrefaction. That this is not the essential cause of yellow fever miasm, is proved bv the same:  array of facts and arguments which are brought against that  of animal putrefaction. Vegetable putrefaction of the most  offensive kind, and in the most extensive degrees, have occurred, without producing a single case of yellow fever in  those frequenting them; and the most devastating epidemics  have prevailed, where no mass of vegetable putrefaction  could be detected. In our own neighborhoods, how often do  we find colton seed in a rotten stale, to the amount of several  hundred bushels together, with a stench almost intolerable,  where no fever of any kind, much less yellow fever, is produced on the plantations? During the hot weather of summer, this is a common occurrence; yet, in no instance has it  produced yellow fever among the swarms of negroes, and  often white men, who are daily about them. In the last epidemic of Natchez, no masses of vegetable putrefaction were  even suspected. When vegetable putrefaction or decompose  tion is carried on most rapidly, or in seasons with regular  vicissitudes of rain and sunshine, there is no yellow fever:  but it makes its appearance often when all moisture is dissipated from the face of the ground: and when the process of  vegetable decomposition, must have entirely ceased, for wani  ol moisture. The whole weight of testimony is against the  probability of vegetable putrefaction being an active cause.  3. Of marsh miasm. Dr. Bancroft has labored much  to prove that this is the true cause of yellow fever; bin hi,  labors on that point have all been in vain. We find this disease prevailing equally in the vicinity of marshes, anil on  the dry and barren rock, where no marsh is near. We find  it equally prevalent on high and on low situations; upon, the  high bluff at Natchez, and on the still more elevated Hi I Is (,f  Washington, as well as in the low marshes of Charleston and  the quagmires of New Orleans; upon the sandy beaches of  Pensacola and Mobile, and upon the rocks of Lisbon, Cadiz,  and Gibraltar: we find it equally in the alluvial delta of th,.  Mississippi and Orinoco, and upon the sterile shores of Curra-  coa, where marshes are unknown. On the other hand, in  many alluvial and marshy regions on the lower Mississippi  and elsewhere, which ought to be most favorable to the production of mnrsh-miasm, yellow fever is unknown. In the  West Indies, where it is endemic all the year, it prevails alike  on the fertile, and on the barren shores; but it is unknown in  the interior.  4th. Arid and humid atmospheres are alike non-essential  to its production. For, under every variety of aridity oi  humidity of the atmosphere, has it appeared in our own country, as well as elsewhere. It has made its first appearance  in New Orleans as an epidemic, in cloudy, damp, and wel  weather; it has appeared there also in the driest weather; it has appeared also in other southern ports, in dry nnd  in humid weather; after a wet and a dry spring; after a  warm and a cool spring; it has prevailed at Natchez, after a  wet and a dry summer; and, again, when the same months  have not been either unusually wet or dry. It prevails in  commercial places, equally where the air is habitually humid,  and where it is habitually arid: no less in Charleston auJ  New Orleans, than on the parched shores of Curracoa.  Dr. Peixotto informs us, that the yellow fever is endemial  in the island of Curracoa at all times and seasons, but it occurs  more especially in the calm and sultry months of the year.  New comers from northern latitudes are its appropriate subjects : the natives and seasoned inhabitants being exempt from  its attacks." * On this island, it becomes epidemic only when  large numbers of northern strangers arrive during thesitltrit  months of the year. Yet the air of this island is proverbial  for its dry, elastic qualities. Dr. P. informs us, " The air m  pure anil dry, and seldom or never darkened with mists anil  fogs, so frequent nt the North. * * * During the droughts,  which arc common, the leafless desolation of winter reigns  nnd. r a tropical sun: ordinary wells are exhausted; animate  and inanimate nature suffers under the burden, and seems  nearly ready to waste away and perish." f On this island,  there is no marsh, or scarcely a stream of fresh water.  5th. Sensible changes of temperature, alone, have no material influence over the generation, or accumulation ofthis  miasm.

We nted not go further than  lo our own city for the facts. According to a meteorological  table given by Dr. Perlee, f the medtl temperature of July  and August, for sixty-two days, in IS 14-IS 16, and 1818, was  steadily from 80" to 83", yet no yellow fever occurred in Natchez in either year. In 1817, the mean temperature of July  was 80" for thirty-one days, and August 77" for thirty-one  days, giving a mean temperature of 78^" for sixty-two days,  and vet the yellow fever prevailed malignantly. In 1819,  the mean temperature of both July and August, sixty-two  days, was up lo only 79" each month, and the mean of September for thirty days, was 75," and yet the yellow fever prevailed with great mortality, having become epidemic on the  14th of September. We might cite authority without end,  to show the same facts in other places every year; hut we will  adduce only one more from Natchez, as obtained from the  tables of Dr. Tooley and others. In 1824, the mean temperature of July was 80" for thirty-one days; of August,  82{" for thirty-one days : together sixty-two days, averaging  84,° and yet no yellow fever occurred in Natchez that yenr.f  In 1825, the mean temperature of July was 81" for thirty-one  days; and of August 83J" for thirty-one days: averaging  82° fur the whole, or 2" less than 1824, yet the yellow fever  prevailed with great mortality. If the miasm of yellow fever  were the result of any change of moisture, or of TEMPERA-  i em: solely, which the thermometer would indicate, then we  might avert it by watering the streets, to reduce the tempera-  lure: nr, al least, we might be able to fbrelel its appearance,  aim escape in time,    1 Jut this has not yet been done.  There is, doubtless, more or less of it general "epidemic  constitution ofthe atmosphere" existing at certain times, over  .'in extensive scope of country. This peculiar state of the  atmosphere, will doubtless predispose the inhabitants to diseases ol t certain type, and they will be afflicted epidemically,  where ibe particular locality is favorable, and the requisite  exciting causes are brought into action. Hut as regards yellow fever, wo believe the peculiar condition of ihe general  almosphero, which precedes it, can he observed, and guarded  against, by proper and timely precaution, and the avoiding and  removing what are admitted to be exciting causes. This  "epidemic constitution of the air," can bo nothing else than  'he ™o,„. of Hippocrates; or the " seminarium e. c/elo di-  missum" of Diemerhrceck, if it be not from some physical  "use; and the present state of medical science is such, that we  aro not satisfied with an explanation which implies mystery.

But few remain who are not able (o perceive, that persons may be infected with yellow fever, who sleep in beds or blankets, taken  from highly infected air, or which have likewise been used  as the death-bed of yellow fever patients.  As we have saitl that yellow fever is a commercial disease,  wo will show to what extent it is so, and in what manner it  obtains thnt character. In our citation ol authority, we have  been careful to depend upon those who range themselves as  the advocates of the domestic origin of the disease, and not  upon those who have been steeped in the doctrine of contagion. This fact, we hope, will give duo weight to the authority which we adduce.  All testimony tends conclusively to establish the point, that  ships which have been long at sea in tropical latitudes, have  occasionally become thoroughly infected with yellow fever  miasm or infection, either while at sen, or while in port: and  that this infection has occasionally been so concentrated as to  have produced yellow fever in its most aggravated form, in  those who have gone on board from shore; and that such  persons have taken the yellow fever, and died of it in from  five to ten days after they breathed the infected air of the  ship; although, at that time, none of the sailors or hands on  the ship, were laboring under that disease. In this manner  doubtless, in some instances, litis yellow fever begun to prevail in sea-ports, among the many who daily, unconscious of  the infection, visit such ships while in port. In this manner,  in many instances, have the first twenty or thirty cases been  traced to intercourse with an infected ship, or to goods from  the same. These first cases are generally persons near the  wharves, draymen, day-laborers, and others who are engaged  in assisting to unload the cargo. It is perfectly immaterial  whether the ship brought the infection from a foreign port,  or generated it during her voyage. If the air in her hold  can be disseminated about the wharf or even if it will cause  those who visit tho ship to die of yellow fever, it certainly is  an imported disease to those who suffer.  A ship can certainly become infected, nnd much more completely than a house, or a district of a city. On shipboard,  the air below is necessarily close for want of ventilation.—  Wc will not travel over all the mass of testimony which  might be adduced: but will cite only a few instances in our  own country, which are conclusive: for one unquestionable  case, is as amply illustrative of the principle, as twenty.  Dr. Tully,* one of Ihe most scientific physicians of Connecticut, gives an account of a number of cases of yellow  fever at Knowles' Landing, in August, 1706. This is a village on tho Connecticut river, about six miles below Middle-  town, containing a population of about two hundred souls,  ■  t'H  \ ^ 1  '•   4  •   i'i  • Sao Med. sn.l Phys, Jour, of New York, vol.

The number of cases that  occurred at this place was eleven, of whom nine died. Every  case was clearly traced to communication with a vessel which  had recently ai rived from Havana, on board which one of  the sailors had died with yellow fever on the voyage. Th.  whole number of cases occurred and terminated in the course  of a fortnight; for tt'i alarm excited by the appearance of|  a malignant disease among them, caused a complete and  speedy desertion of the village, and non-intercourse with the  ship. This village has always maintained the character of!  uncommon salubrity. Up to the arrival of the infected ship,  no disease of any kind prevailed; and immediately the ship  was abandoned by the inhabitants, the disease ceased. The  infection on board this ship was not generated by putrefaction  of either animal or vegetable matters, as none existed on  board; and Dr. Tully declares that she was perfectly clean;  no such matters were found in the town, or suspected by any  as the cause of the disease: the ship was the undoubted  source, and none were attacked but such as had been on  board. In this case had the weather been such as generally  precedes epidemic yellow fever: and had the inhabitants not  fled, but remained, and continued their intercourse with the  infected ship, the town would doubtless have been visited with  epidemic yellow fever.  Dr. Tully informs us, that as many other cases occurred a  the different places at which this vessel anchored in ascend  ing the river, and always in those only who had been or  board. He also informs us, that, for the last twenty-five  years, scarcely a year has passed, in which one or more similar cases have not appeared at different points on the Connecticut river; all of which are clearly attributable solely to intercourse with vessels from the West Indies, or from southern  ports of the United States.  Dr. Bayley,* health officer of the port of New York,  gives an account of a number of cases of yellow fever which  occurred, in the autumn of 1821, at the "quarantine establishment," or. Staten Island, six miles below the city. From  the 8th of September until the 7th of October, twenty-nine  cases and twenty-one deaths occurred; of ihe latter, fourteen  had black vomit. These cases were clearly traced to intercourse with infected vessels then lying at the wharf, nnd recently from the West Indies and New Orleans. Tho health  of those about the " quarantine establishment" never was  better, both immediately before and after these cases: nothing-  like bilious or remittent fever had been seen : neither marshes, nor filth, nor vegetable putrefaction existed any where in  the vicinity. The cases were traced clearly to the ships, and  to them alone : and each case occurred just five days, and  one on the sixth day, after the particular exposure to the infected air of the vessels. A washerwoman and her two  daughters, took the disease, without having been on board the  vessels. They contracted their disease by handling nnd washing the foul clothes and bedding of four men who had died  of yellow fever about four days previously. The bedding  and clothes had been thrown aside until taken to her to be  ' New York Med. and Phys, Jour. vol. 1, p. 27,28,dec,  washed. She took the disease just five days after she had  handled the clothes, and died on the fifth day of her disease;  her daughters were attacked afterwards. In this case, a favorable condition of the air would, no doubt, have caused it  to become epidemic.  Dr. Bayley * also gives us the case of the United States'  brig Enterprise, infected with yellow fever, at the "quaran-  tine ground," in 1822. This vessel was perfectly clean, and  free from any animal or vegetable putrefaction. She arrived  from Havana with ten cases on board; and immediately the  sick were removed to the hospital, and the well were quartered on shore, to avoid the infected air of the vessel. She  was then thoroughly cleansed, ventilated, washed, and whitewashed with lime, in a tenfold degree; lime was slaked in her  timbers in large quantities. Yet, after this purification, she  retained tho infection, and communicated the yellow fever lo  those wlio afterwards went on board; of whom five, out of  eleven, died. The process of purification was again instituted. Artificial ventilation with windsails was constantly  performed; water, to the depth of several feet, was daily let  in, and pumped out: lime was strewed in the hold, and her  timbers thoroughly whitewashed, and still the infection was  not destroyed, until cold weather. In this case, her own crew  having taken the disease first, the people from shore avoided  the vessel, and escaped the disease.  Another case is given by Dr. Kollock, and quoted by Dr.  Rush, in which a vessel at sea, in tropical latitudes, engendered on board a malaria which finally produced yellow fever.  This is the case of the United States' frigate General Greene,  which became infected while on a cruise in the West India  sens, and did not become disinfected until she reached the  cold climate of Rhode Island During the time, she retain  ed the infection, every kind of cleansing, fumigation, and ventilation, were used freely, but ineffectually. In this case, the  vessel was new, and perfectly clean and healthy, when she  left Newport, Rhode Island, on the 3d of June, 1790. She  had on board a complement of two hundred and fourteen  souls, besides large quantities of provisions for a cruise in the  West India seas. Having encountered a storm, soon after  she put to sen, the vessel became leaky, and a noxious malaria was generated, during a subsequent period of unusually  hot weather. At first, and for some days, the disease assumul  the symptoms of a violent bilious fever, with no deaths until  they arrived in the port of Havana: when immediately sevr-  ral cases began to assume symptoms of yellow fever. " After  this period," says Dr. Kollock, "three, four, and five new-  cases occurred daily; and the violence of the symptom  seemed to increase, with the multiplication of cases, during  le six days she lay in port." f Cases and deaths continued  to multiply daily, until she passed the capes of Virginia, when  the disease became gradually milder. The whole number of  the cases was forty; and twenty of them died. In this case,  an infectious air was generated in the ship's hold, by the number on board, during the hot weather and leaky condition of  the vessel; and it appears that the" leaven" of infection ivu  superadded at the port of Havana, either by persons going on  • New York Mod. and Phys.

Many other cases might be cited, in  which infection has been generated and carried in ships into  ports, and there produced yellow fever in those from shore  who entered on board, although the crew of the vessel, being  acclimated, remained free from disease.  The only point remaining, to establish the importability of  epidemic yellow fever in ports, is whether the dissemination  of the infected air of the ship in the vicinity of the wharf,  among the crowds that frequent them, and reside near them,  together with ten, twenty, thirty, or more cases, which were  contracted by going on board such vessels, be capable of  causing the disease to spread, among those contiguous, who  do not go on board, and this when the temperature of the  senson, and the sultry, and if desired, the miasmatic state of  the air. is in the most favorable condition for disseminating the  disease. Of this, we think there can be no reasonable doubt.  Dr. Rush, and his coadjutors in favor of the domestic origin  of yellow fever, admitted that(it might, and had occasionally,  spread from ships in an impure air.  Dr. Mitchell,* one of the most able advocates of the local  or domestic origin of yellow fever, in a report made to Con  gress, February 25th, 1803, admits, and even contends that  vessels often become highly infected, while at sea; that an impure air is generated in the holds during hot, sultry weather  in tropical climates: that this infection may be communicated,  not only to those who go on board, but that the infected air  may be diffused in the atmosphere about the wharves and  shipping, and thus excite the disease more generally. He  contends, very properly, against useless and idle detention al  quarantine, when no disease or infection has been on board  the vessel; but he urges the necessity of detention, and thorough ventilation and cleansing, in case of infection, until the  infection is destroyed. In all this he denies the foreign origin  of infection. But is it not immaterial to those in sea port  towns, whether the infection be generated on board, or contracted in a foreign port? If it can spread among those  where the. ship arrives, it is as important to guard against it,  as if it were of foreign origin. Dr. Rush unequivocally  admits that there is much danger to bo apprehended from  "the foul air of ships," where cases of yellow fever have occurred. He also admonishes us, "to prevent the landing of  persons affected with the ship fever, in our cities, and the more  •longerons practice of ships pouring streams of pestilential  air from, their holds upon Ihe citizens, who lire near the docks  and wharves."    Med. Rep. vol. 6, p. 166.  Again, in a communication from Dr. Rush and others to  Gov. Mifflin, in relation to the yellow fever of 1797, in Philadelphia and Kensington, it is maintained, " that, in addition  '"the filth and puirefaction about the city, the foul air issuing  from the holds of two ships, (designated,) produced the. yellow  fever, independently of foreign contagion." Again, the authors declare, that "the close, unvcntilated holds of ships,  after long voyages in hot climates, with perishable matters  on board, thrown open in a heated, sultry atmosphere, arc a  fruitful source of miasm: although they infer, that " yellow  ' See Med. Repos. vol. 0, p. 400, 4c.  fever has not been so often, propagated by contagion, as has  been supposed."    See Med. Repos. vol. 2, p. 95, 96.  Without multiplying authority, we will cite one case which  is full of instruction to those who preside over the port police  of our cities. We mean the " Yellow Fever " of New York  in the summer and fall of 1822. This epidemic, if it could  be so called, commenced by scattering cases from the 15th to  the 20th of July, and cases multiplied gradually until the  15th of August, when it was considered epidemic. The  whole number of yellow fever cases, from the I5th of July  until the 1st of November, when it ceased, was about four  hundred and thirty, of whom about two hundred and fifty  died. It began in Rector street, near the wharf, where four  ships' cargoes had been discharged from infected vessels, a  few days before. From this point, it spread very slowly over  several squares in the vicinity, having extended only a few  squares in thirty days: while the remainder of the city was  unusually healthy. The squares over which it prevailed  most fatally, were bounded by wide, clean, and airy streets,  and the most substantial buildings in the city: no filth could  be found in the vicinity; the infected air from the original infected point having been wafted thither by the winds.  These are the facts without speculation; viz : the first cases  began between the I5th, and 20th of July. Between th«  1st and the 9th of July, the cargoes of four infected vessels  from Havana, were discharged at tho wharf nt the foot of  Rector street, and stored in warehouses. Two of these vessels had lost some of their crews by yellow fever, on the voyage; the crews of the other two were Spaniards and acclimated sailors. During tho first two weeks of July, the weather was very warm, the sun cloudless, nnd the air "very  calm and sultry." During the months of July nnd August,  there were almost daily arrivals of other vessels from Havana, and other ports where yellow fever was known to be  prevailing. During this period, the number of vessels from  West India ports was unusual; because, on account of the  terror of pirates, they came in companies, under the convoy  of battle ships. The following are the arrivals at the quarantine ground, between tho 11th of June, and the 17th of October ; viz: From Havana, eleven vessels, having, or having  had on board, forty-four cases of yellow fever and twenty-one  deaths; from Matanzas, one vessel, wilh three cases of yellow  fever; from St. Jago, two vessels, having had three deaths  from yellow fever; from Port au Prince, St. Domingo, four  vessels, with six deaths from yellow fever : from Vera Cruz,  between July 17th and 28th, three vessels, with nineteen  cases and two deaths from yellow fever, before arrival. Besides these, there were, during that time, about forty other  vessels from southern and West India ports, whose crews, being Spaniards or acclimated seamen, had no cases during their  voyage, although the air in some of the vessels proved infectious to those who wero unacclimaled.  If any ono will take the pains to examine the accounts of  this epidemic, as detailed by Dr. Townsend,* Dr. Bayley, and  Dr. Walters, and after making every allowance, especially  to Dr. Townsend for his views of contagion, of that charity  which the advocates of tho exclusive local origin of yellow  it  I  • ,■:♦.•!.-";,  iMi/ifoH  II  :",  in  ■ TV'l  '1J  • ■ I  r  I  S  : i  • Sco Townsend on Yellow Fever of New York, in 1822. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/455	455	456.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/456.jp2

IRff'4  fever are so ready to bestow, he will find ample reason to admit,  that the atmosphere about the wharves was contaminated  by the infectious air imported in ships from tropical climates.  To those who are at all conversant with the history of nautical diseases in hot climates, it cannot be a matter of doubt,  that vessels frequently become infected, while cruising in tropical seas, and lying in tropical ports, and the sailors and passengers, especially when they are unaccliinated natives oil  northern latitudes, will sicken and die. An infected air also  accumulates gradually, in some manner, in the holds, which  will infect strangers, although the crew may not suffer  When large quantities of this air is brought into our ports,  in hot, sultry weather, as was the case at New York in 1822,  it will certainly infect the contiguous local atmosphere; or  act as a morbific " leaven" to it, just as the infected air of an  " infected district" gradually extends itself over other parts  of u city. It docs not change the nature of the case, whether  the infected air depend, in any degree, upon personal "contagion." But if the yellow fever, ns an epidemic, depend sole.  Iy upon "an epidemic constitution of the atmosphere," we  would inquire, why it does not affect every part of a city indiscriminately, and not that part only near the shipping?  If any one admits that the air of a city can be infected from  a pile of putrid matters or filth, why can he not perceive that  it can be much more readily infected from a source where the  infection is completely formed, and virulent, and only requires  diffusion in the air? Let not the specious term "contagion,"  mislead.  If these sources of miasm or infection be capable of exciting yellow fever in those persons who reside near the landings, although highly predisposed by the impure air of the  city, but who might otherwise escape, it is but poor consolation to be informed, that it is not "contagion," or that the in  fection is not brought from a foreign port. To them il isim.  ported, although it may have been generated only three days  or twenty-tour hours before the ship arrived in port. If only  the exciting cause is thus imported, would not all cities do  well to prohibit the introduction of this exciting cause?  We have said yellow fever is a commercial disease; and  that it prevails mostly in ports which carry on extensive  trade with tropical countries or ports. Those towns and cities  which do not carry on such commerce, are mostly exempt  from yellow fever, although in the same latitude with those  afflicted by that disease, and under the same general circumstances. To say the least, they arc exempt from the exciting  cause, whether it be infected air from ships, or the simple fatigue and exposure of seamen about the ships. In certain  years, a general predisposition exists, as the effect or result  of continued hot, sultry weather, from New Voile, or even  from Boston, along the whole sea-board, to New Orleans.  This general predisposition, which may, however, vary in  degree at different places, finally, in most places, passes ofl  without any epidemic, yellow fever, except in a few towns or  ports, which, have line deep harbors, and enjoy extensive commerce with tropical countries. In others not possessing  these advantages, it docs not prevail. Hence we find it prevails in Philadelphia.   New  York.    Baltimore.     Norfolk,  1 -  Charleston, Mobile, and New Orleans; but why does it not  prevail, at the same time, in Harrisburg, nt Troy, at Washington City, at Richmond, at Columbia, at Oppelousas, at Tuscaloosa, and other inland towns ? The same general predisposition, or " epidemic constitution of the air," exists in all these  places; but only a few of them are exposed to the " exciting  cause, necessary to produce an epidemic:—the "leaven"  from the infected air of ships, or goods from infected places,  are wanting to complete the train. Those towns that arc  destitute of these, avoid the pestilence. Sporadic cases may  occur from high exciting causes of another kind, but in a  free, pure air, it passes off without exciting other cases.  A case presents directly in point, on this subject, as well  as in relation to tho agency of putrid exhalations and marsh  miasm in the production of yellow fever.    The town of Cam-  pcachey is situated on the Gulf of Mexico, in latitude 19° 45'  N.—Vera Cruz is situated about three hundred and fifty  miles distant, but in about the same latitude.    Campeacheyis  healthy, and Vera Cruz is visited annually with yellow fever,  The circumstances  generally considered most favorable lo  the production of yellow fever, are equal in both places. Cam-  peachey is built mostly of stone, upon a substratum of limestone rock; the soil of the surrounding country, as well as a  part of the town, is a sandy loam, and often becomes very  muddy; the town is surrounded by a stone   wall about ten  feet high; the streets are wide; the houses are large and  liry ; on the back part of the town, there is a high hill, or  moderate mountain, which greatly interrupts ventilation, so  at the inhabitants suffer greatly, from "all tho inconveniences of a sultry, confined air."    " In front of the middle  of the city, is a large wharf or mole, extending one hundred  yards into the water.     Along this mole, there is constantly  deposited large quantities of filth of every kind, together with  • large quantities of putrid fish. "    " When the tide, (which  rises and falls two or three feet,) retires, all these matters are  left exposed in the mud, and on the shore, to the direct rays of  a vertical sun, until the stench  is intolerable to strangers."  Besides these things, there are also other "accumulations of  lillh in other parts of the town."    Yet "the inhabitants are  very healthy " : there is only one physician in the place, nnd  he has not half employment in his profession, although "the  population is about ten thousand."    See Med. Rep. vol. 4, p.  5-8.     Vera Cruz is situated upon a sandy plain, with sand  hills in its rear; contains no more  filth than Campeachey:  the air is no more confined or sultry ; the inhabitants are no  less temperate; yet Campeachey is healthy, and Vera Cruz is  annually visited with yellow fever of the most malignant  type.    See Med. Repos., vol. 4, p. 7 and 8 : also, vol. 3, p.  46, &c, A. D. 1800.  How is this paradox explained?—Campeachey has an extensive, but shallow harbor, so that large ships cannot approach near the town; only boats and small craft can enter  the harbor, such as do not exceed fifteen or twenty tons.—  Hence, so far as commerce with remote regions, and the foul  air of large ships, from long tropical voyages, are concerned,  it is equivalent to an inland town: and it is also free from lh?  crowds of strangers, who infest large commercial ports. Bill  Vera Cruz carries on an extensive commerce, has a fine deep 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/456	456	457.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/457.jp2

These, when  attacked, contribute to the infection, which is like " leaven  in the contaminated ntmosphcrr, and assists in producing the  epidemics.    Ibid, p. 78.  Although the yellow fever is endemial all the year in Cuba, it is almost exclusively confined to the commercial ports.  The elevated savannas of the interior are as much a stranger  to it, as our own interior towns. In the ports, it attacks principally Strangers, and prevails mostly from the beginning of  July to the middle of November. When there is a great in-  lluxof strangers, it becomes more malignant, and finally attacks many of the acclimated inhabitants, especially such as  are exposed to the ordinary exciting causes of fevers. It is  believed,among the people of Cuba, that the influx of stran-j  r/ers, and their numerous attacks from yellow fever, contaminates the air, or infects it, and causes it sometimes to become  epidemic, when otherwise it would not have prevailed.  To produce yellow fever as nn epidemic in our cities, we  tonceive three grades or stages of action in the production  of tho infection:—first, the miasm, or simple basis, which  alone is innocent. 2d. Its combination with impure, or exhausted air, or with air deprived of its healthy, respiratory  properties, and charged with animal exhalations:—in this  state, we call it infections air, or malaria. In this state, it is  a strong predisposing cause of disease, and a suitable "nidus"  for the reception and extension of personal infection. 3d.  Infection, or the union of personal infection with infectious!  air, or malaria. In this state, it is an aerial ferment: and,i  when respired; becomes the active, predisposing, and exciting  causeof yellow fever.   These views we will further illustrate.

This volume contains the elements of the history of the  civilized world for upwards of ten centuries. Compared  with the present state of society, this long period presents  scenes of barbarism and violence, full of wars and desolation  with occasional exhibitions of extraordinary genius, and with  here and there brief and limited seasons of rest and refine  ment. But the reader will perceive, that it comprehends too  large a field of action within its narrow limits, to admit of a  profound and regular deduction of causes and effects, and a  full delineation of the characters and motives of the actors  The remark of the author, in reference to the history of  France, from the year 1000 to 1500, seems to describe the  character of his work, nnd is a fair specimen of his manner.  " Discouraging as these elements may be," he says, " we are  to find in these five centuries, the causes of the great changes  which have since taken place in the political, social, and religious condition of society. The labor which is now intended,  is to search out these causes, and to discern how that power  has been exerted, which the Author of our being bestowed to  improve and benefit the human race. It will be seen that  discoveries and inventions, which havo been proved to be most  useful and permanent, were tho product of solitary genius or  of accident, and that those who havo thus benefited tho world,  did not even imagine tho consequences of their acts. It will  be seen also, that tho efforts of the wisest and most powerful  among men, have often led to results ofthe most mischievous  character. And, again, that some of the ablest conductors  of human affairs, who intended nothing but their own ag.  grandizement, undesignedly introduced important meliora.  tions of society. Such facts humble the pride of man, while  they raise his thoughts to tho great Disposer of events, who  brings forth, in his own time and manner, in the long series  of ages, his own beneficent purposes."—p. 212.  Mr. Sullivan has not restricted himself to a minute enumeration of events, in an exact chronological order, nor does  the work belong to the class of annals, He describes the  geographical situation of countries, and fixes the relative po-  sition of celebrated cities; and while attentive to dates, and lo  the progress of history, he marks the distinguished eras and  the renowned actors with more or less brevity, as suits his  taste or convenience. Occasionally, he leaves the series of  events, and indulges in a more ample discussion. The reader  will find a valuable account of the Feudal System, a condensed  view of the usurpation and triumph of the Papal authority,  sketches of the origin nnd progress of the Canon and Civil  Law, with occasional illustrations of tho advancement of arts  and literature, and of the struggles for political freedom in  different ages and nations.  The sketches which the author gives of Charlemagne, of  Louis the eleventh of France, of Ferdinand and Isabella of  Spain, of tho origin of the League of the Swiss Cantons, of  Venice, of tho Mahometan imposture, and the Note on Ihe  differences of the Greek and Roman Churches, are favorable  specimens of his talents as a writer, and, like springs of water in a great extent of desert, make every thing green and  fresh in their neighborhood.  The author, inhaling the spirit of the best writers, and  availing himself of their learned industry, has drawn his  materials from the most authentic sources.—His style is simple and clear, without a studied effort after profound observation or ornament. To write well requires labor, and a care  fill pruning of useless words and redundant sentiments. Hit  moral and political remarks, which display the mind of the  writer, possess much merit, and will not fail to be remembered. His work is the production of a scholar, retired, aflet  much experience of life, from the strife of a laborious profession, and occupying his leisure with the pursuits of literature, the fruits of which he is desirous to communicate to others. It may be read, we think, with profit to all, although the  course of events is so rapid, that it is a somewhat severe task  to the memory to keep up the chain; but it is designed particularly for the young, and is well calculated to form their  taste for the study of history.  Those who read history merely to learn the chain of events,  the characters of the actors, and to be able to shine in conversation, study to some purpose, but not to the best. The historian is the moral and political instructor of mankind. It i»  in his pages, that the philosopher may learn the lessons of  experience, and what is fit and becoming in the great. He  should therefore be endowed with extraordinary talents and  virtues. While recording tho events which he celebrates, he  should be able to trace the causes with lucid order.

'  Mr. Sullivan is always the friend to religion, and to the  ureat principles on which society rests. He could not breathe  a thought which would disturb its beautiful order, or which  could bo construed, even by a malignant foe, into an attempt  to array the poor against tho rich, or the weak against the  strong. Not all the merit of Gibbon, great as it is, can atone  for his occasional departures from modest)', or for his disin-  g iiii-.us attacks on the christian religion. It is but a poor  apology for a scholar, that he places in a note, or veils in a  learned and unspoken language, an offence against purity.  We cannot deny to Gibbon, that he has produced an immor  tal work; but all its splendid merit cannot conceal what we  regret, for the honor of his fame, that it is not free from  fault.  Mr. Sullivan has promised another volume, in which he  proposes !o treat of causes and effects among European nations  an.! llieir colonics, during the last three centuries. The difficulty of condensing the events of this period into so narrow a  compass, and, as he approaches our own time, of making a  wise selection of facts from tho chaos of materials, will, we  trust, only give ardor to his courage and strength to his purpose- But even virtue, to succeed, must have an ample field  fir action; and it is one of the canons of history, that to be  perl'iti, it must be limited to a brief and interesting period,  that the writer should rigidly adhere to his plan, nnd that In  should give to it all the dramatic effect of which itiscapalde.  May the laurel be growing, which shall crown the author,  and best reward his success.  T  AN ESSAY.  THE K.UKKCTS  01'  RELIGION  ON  TIIK   POLITICAL,   INTF.I.LECTCA1.,    MC  AND SOCIAL  HTATE OP MAN.  Itrail bsforethoJeffereonCollcge ami Washington Lyceum, Spiit. y,  1837, by Itnv. II. St. IIiiakk.  There is, in the government of God, a wise adaptation of  laws to subjects. The laws of the physical world are abso  lute and irresistible, and, from their combined operation, are  produced the admirable regularity and harmony seen in the  universe. Were it possible that one of these laws should be  infracted, for instance the law of gravitation, into what confusion and discord would the heavens and earth bo Instantly  thrown.  Important as is the law of gravitation to the order ofthe  natural world, it is not more so than are some of the great  truths of religion to the moral world: for instance, the knowledge of a Supremo Being, to whom man is accountable.  "he knowledge of this truth lies at the foundation of all intellectual improvement and social order. Take this from  "tin, and you remove the strongest motive to intellectual culture and moral restraint.    You blot the sun from the universe,  and unloose the strongest bonds which unite society. You  reduce man to a mere floating atom, without aim, or end, or  motive. But acquaint man with this leading truth in religion, and you, at once, set before him a highcaieer of glory,  honor, and immortality. You supply him with motives to  moral and intellectual culture, high as the heaven to which  he may aspire, and deep as the ruin to which he may sink.  These principles, which appear to me almost with the force  of intuition, have been disputed by many. It has been contended that religion, in all its forms, contracts tho mind, dissolves or weakens tho bonds of government, dissocializes  man, and, still more strange, weakens moral obligation. Nor  has it been the avowed enemies of religion alone, who have  thus traduced its influence. Professed friends, nnd even real  friends, havo been misled by the bold assertions of enemies.  It is not uncommon to hear it as gravely asserted, ns if it had  been a thousand times proved, that religion has been the  cause of more bloodshed than anything else; that it has  trammelled free inquiry, and thus kept the minds of men in  darkness. Hence the revival of letters has been considered  a triumph of free thinking over religion. The moroseness  and unsociability of the anchorite, have been attributed to its  influence, nnd even duplicity and fraud have been considered  its legitimate effects.  I should consider it an easy task to show that there is in  religion, abstractly considered, nothing to produce these consequences. But abstract tendencies are seldom appealed to  on this subject: we nre referred to its fruits, and by this test,  by their fruits ye shall know them," wo are willing (o  abide.  But I would not be understood to present myself ns the  apologist or extenuator of all the crimes which have been  committed under the garb and pretext of religion. Religion,  as well as patriotism, friendship, and philanthropy, has been  laid under contribution to ambition, avarice, and voluptuousness. But so soon as these are admitted to be the governing  motives, you clear religion of the crimes, to which it is tho  unwilling pretext. I am farther prepared to concede, that  honest persons have been so far misled, as to commit crimes  against society for the sake of religion; but even this should  be set down to the account of the frailty of our nature, rather  than to religion, which has not, abstractly, any tendency to  produce such effects.  After all the offsets which lukewarm friends, or malicious  enemies, can demand, I will still venture to maintain, that,  upon the whole, religion is beneficial to the human family. I  am disposed to think that this is a truth, if applied in the  most extended sense of the term; but it is my purpose to make  my observations especially in reference to the Christian religion. I would, however, make one or two general remarks.  The first is, that it is very difficult to find points of comparison: as, on the one hand, it is hard to find any community  holly governed by the precepts of religion, so, on the other,  it is impossible to find a nation without some of its influences.

This volume contains the elements of the history of the  civilized world for upwards of ten centuries. Compared  with the present state of society, this long period presents  scenes of barbarism and violence, full of wars and desolation,  with occasional exhibitions of extraordinary genius, and with  here and there brief and limited seasons of rest and refinement. But the reader will perceive, that it comprehends too  large a field of action within its narrow limits, to admit of a  profound and regular deduction of causes and effects, and a  full delineation of the characters and motives of the actors.  The remark of the author, in reference to the history of  France, from the year 1000 to 1500, seems to describe the  character of his work, nnd is a fair specimen of his manner.  " Discouraging as these elements may be," he says, "we are  to find in these five centuries, the causes of the great changes  which have since taken place in the political, social, and religious condition of society. The labor which is now intended,  is to search out these causes, and to discern how that power  has been exerted, which the Author of our being bestowed to  improve and benefit the human race. It will be seen that  discoveries and inventions, which have been proved to be most  useful and permanent, were the product of solitary genius or  of accident, and that those who have thus benefited the world,  did not even imagine tho consequences of their acts. It will  be seen also, that the efforts of the wisest and most powerful  Aii  among men, have often led to results of the most mischievous  character. And, again, that some of the ablest conductors  of human affairs, who intended nothing but their own ag.  grandizement, undesignedly introduced important meliora.  tions of society. Such facts humble the pride of man, while  they raise his thoughts to tho great Disposer of events, who  brings forth, in his own time and manner, in the long series  of ages, his own beneficent purposes."—p. 212.  Mr. Sullivan has not restricted himself to a minute enumeration of events, in an exact chronological order, nor docs  the work belong to the class of annals, He describes the  geographical situation of countries, and fixes the relative position of celebrated cities; and while attentive to dates, and to  tho progress of history, he marks the distinguished eras and  the renowned actors with more or less brevity, as suits his  taste or convenience. Occasionally, he leaves the series of  events, and indulges in a more ample discussion. The reader  will find a valuable account of the Feudal System, a condensed  view of the usurpation and triumph of the Papal authority,  sketches of the origin and progress of the Canon and Civil  Law, with occasional illustrations of the advancement of arts  and literature, and of the struggles for political freedom in  different ages and nations.  The sketches which tho author gives of Charlemagne, of  Louis the eleventh of France, of Ferdinand and Isabella of  Spain, of the origin of the League of the Swiss Cantons, of  Venice, of the Mahometan imposture, and the Note on the  differences of the Greek and Roman Churches, are favorable  specimens of his talents as a writer, and, like springs of water in a great extent of desert, make every thing green and  fresh in their neighborhood.  Tho author, inhaling the spirit of the best writers, and  availing himself of their learned industry, has drawn his  materials from the most authentic sources.—His style is simple and clear, without a studied effort after profound observation or ornament. To write well requires labor, and a careful pruning of useless words and redundant sentiments. Hii  moral and political remarks, which display the mind of ihe  writer, possess much merit, nnd will not fail to be remembered. His work is tho production of n scholar, retired, after  much experience of life, from the strife of a laborious profession, and occupying his leisure with the pursuits of literature, the fruits of which he is desirous to communicate to others. It may be read, we think, with profit to all, although the  course of events is so rapid, that it is a somewhat severe task  to the memory to keep up the chain ; but it is designed particularly for the young, and is well calculated to form their  taste for the study of history.  Those who read history merely to learn the chain of events,  the characters of the actors, and to be able to shine in convei-  sation, study to some purpose, but not to the best. The historian is the moral and political instructor of mankind. It"  in his pages, that the philosopher may learn the lessons of  experience, and what is fit and becoming in the great. He  should therefore be endowed with extraordinary talents and  virtues. While recording the events which he celebrates, he  should bo able to trace the causes with lucid order.

Like the great  p.-irtrait painter, who is perfectly skilled in anatomy, he should  he able w present men on tho canvass of history, with strict  regird to thoso lights and shades, which are found in every  individual who is distinguished for talent, and placed in an  eminent station. '  .Mr. Sullivan is always tho friend to religion, and to the  trreat principles on which society rests. He could not breathe  a thought which would disturb ils beautiful order, or which  could be construed, even by a malignant foe, into an attempt  to array the poor against tho rich, or the weak against the  strong. Not all the merit of Gibbon, great as it is, can atone  for his occasional departures from modesty, or for his disin-  (j.-icuoils attacks on the christian religion. It is but a poor  apology for a scholar, that ho places in a note, or veils in a  learned and unspoken language, an offence against purity.  We cannot deny to Gibbon, that he has produced an immortal work; but all its splendid merit cannot conceal what we  regret, for tho honor of his fame, that it is not free from  fault.  Mr. Sullivan has promised another volume, in which he  proposes to treat of causes nnd effects among European nations  ami their colonies, during the last three centuries. The diffi  eultyof condensing tho events of this period into so narrow a  compass, and, as he approaches our own time, of making a  wise selection of facts from tho chaos of materials, will, we  trust, only give ardor to his courage and strength to his purpose' But even virtue, to succeed, must have an ample field  for action; and it is one of the canons of history, that to be  jierlitt, it must be limited to a brief and interesting period,  that the writer should rigidly adhere to his plan, and that he  should give to it all the dramatic effect of which it is capable.  May the laurel be growing, which shall crown the author,  anil best reward his success.  T  1######-  AN ESSAY.  THE BKFECTS   01'  HELHIION   ON   Tim   POLITICAL,   INTELLECTUAL,    MORAL.  AND SOCIAL   STATE 01' MAN.  Km.I before tho JeffersonCollcge and Washington I.v  1837, by IInv. II. M, Iiiiakk.  i-iiin, Sept. '2,  There is, in the government of God, a wise adaptation of  laws to subjects. The laws of the physical world are absolute and irresistible, and, from their combined operation, are  produced the admirable regularity and harmony seen in the  universe. Were it possible that one of these laws should be  infracted, for instance the law of gravitation, into what confusion and discord would the heavens and earth be instantly  thrown.  Important as is the law of gravitation to the order ofthe  natural world, it is not more so than are some of the great  truths of religion to the moral world: for instance, the knowledge of a Supreme Being, to whom man is accountable.  The knowledge of this truth lies at the foundation of all intellectual improvement and social order. Take this from  man, nnd you remove the strongest motive to intellectual culture and moral restraint.    You blot the sun from the universe,  and unloese the strongest bonds which unite society. You  reduce man to a mere floating atom, without aim, or end, or  motive. But acquaint man with this leading truth in religion, and you, at once, set before him a high caiccr of glory,  honor, and immortality. You supply him with motives to  moral and intellectual culture, high as the heaven to which  he may aspire, and deep as the ruin to which he may sink.  These principles, which appear to me almost with the force  of intuition, have been disputed by many. It has been contended that religion, in al! its forms, contracts tho mind, dissolves or weakens the bonds of government, dissocializes  man, and, still more strange, weakens moral obligation. Nor  has it been the avowed enemies of religion alone, who have  thus traduced its influence. Professed friends, nnd even real  friends, have been misled by the bold assertions of enemies.  It is not uncommon to hear it ns gravely asserted, ns if it had  been a thousand times proved, that religion has been the  cause of more bloodshed than anything else; Ihat it has  trammelled free inquiry, and thus kept the minds of men in  larkncss. Hence the revival of letters has been considered  a triumph of free thinking over religion. The moroseness  and unsociability of the anchorite, have been attributed to its  influence, nnd even duplicity and fraud have been considered  ils legitimate effects.  I should consider it fin easy task to show that there is in  religion, abstractly considered, nothing to produce these consequences. But abstract tendencies are seldom appealed to  on this subject: we arc referred to its fruits, and by this test,  "by their fruits ye shall know them," we are willing to  abide.  But I would not be understood lo present myself ns the.  apologist or extcnuator of all Ihe crimes which have been  committed under thegarband pretext of religion. Religion,  as well as patriotism, friendship, aud philanthropy, has been  1 miller contribution to ambition, avarice, and voluptuousness. But so soon as these nre admitted to be the governing  motives, you clear religion of the crimes, to which it is the  unwilling pretext. I am farther prepared to concede, that  lonest persons have been so far misled, as to commit crimes  igainst society for the sake of religion; but even this should  bo set down to the account of the frailty of our nature, rather  than to religion, which has not, abstractly, any tendency to  produce such effects.  After all the offsets which lukewarm friends, or malicious  enemies, can demand, I will still venture to maintain, that,  upon tho whole, religion is beneficial to the human family. I  am disposed to think that this is a truth, if applied in the  most extended sense ofthe term; but it is my purpose to make  my observations especially in reference to the Christian religion. I would, however, make one or two general remarks.  The first is, that it is very difficult to find points of comparison : as, on the one hand, it is hard to find any community  wholly governed by the precepts of religion, so, on the other,  t is impossible to find a nation without some of its influences.  All wc can do, is take the points of greatest divergence. Another remark, which I would make at this place, is, that although heathen religions, the Mohammedan religion, or falsi  notions of Christianity, may have in them many things very  VOfc. J.

From all that wo are able to conjecture, guided by the dim  lights of ancient history, those nations who were mostdevoted  to religious worship, were the most civilized, enlightened, and  happy. This applies especially to Egypt, Greece, and Rome.  And these great nations began to decline in their political,  moral, and social relations, when their great men began to  contemn and ridicule the worship of the gods, without substituting any purer form of worship.  There is still another remark which I wish to make in  this place. It is not tho splendor of military achievements,  w'.iich constitutes the standard of national prosperity. Often,  when a nation's anus are triumphant every where, every political privilege is trampled on, and all the moral and social  relations are disregarded. A noble Roman once exclaimed,  when he had achieved a signal victory for his country, "a  few more such victories would ruin Rome."  There nre many evils which Christianity has not yet been  nble to extirpate; but, in most, or all instances, it has mitigated them. The horrors of war have been greatly moderated, by entirely exempting women and children from its  fury, and attending to the safety and comfort of prisoners. By  the good fuith with which Christian nations observe solemn  treaties, more than half the evils of war are prevented.  The good faith observed by the commercial community in  Christian countries, is a source of many of the comforts in a  civilized state of society. Nothing but mutual confidence can  enable the merchants of distant countries to carry on the extensive business necessary to supply the wants of a populous  nnl civilized country. This good faith may be attributed to  Christianity, as it has never existed, to so great an extent,  where this pure form of religion did not prevail. Compare  the well-placed confidence of an English or American merchant, with the treachery of a Chinese or East Indian.  Man, while in tin's world, is liable to misfortune, poverty,  and sickness. In most Christian countries, provision is made  for these unavoidable miseries. Every asylum for taking  care of the helpless orphan, every hospital to nurse and cur.  the sick, every alms-house to take care of the infirm, tin  aged, or the lunatic, is a triumph of Christianity over heartless atheism, or dark heathenism. Institutions of this char-  acter have never been known to flourish, save under the benign influence of Christianity.  But thelendorest and most important relation in life, is tin  domestic circle. And here Christianity has done much for  man. Polygamy, the fruitful source of family contention  and heartburning; and divorce at pleasure, the no less fruitful  source of injustice and licentiousness, nro indigenous in every  heathen soil. Had Christianity done no more for man, than  to regulate the domestic circle, it would have been a boon  worthy of the interposition of a benevolent God, and laying  man under boundless obligations to him. And ho who could  contemn, or lightly esteem such a boon, would prove himsell  exceedingly ungrateful, or brutishly sensual.  But does Christianity promote literature and the sciences?  ■LtflCi  It would be sufficient, in answering this question, to refer to  tho present stato of the world. Where are the most enlirrh.  tened nations to be found? Is it not in Christendom? And  it is worthy of remark, that, by the influence of Christianity  these nations have been elevated from a state of br.barism  or savngism, to their present state And here I would endi-a-  vor to correct an error, which appears to be very common.  It is believed that the ignorance of the dark ages is the result  of tho introduction of Christianity in the Roman empire  Nothing can bo more foreign from the truth. The truth is  that the military despotism which had prevailed long before  Christianity had any voice in that government, had checked  the genius of that people; and the effeminacy which so gene,  rally prevailed, prepared the way for the savage invaders ol  the fifth find sixth centuries. In these invasions and conquests, we have the real cause of the great decline of learning. The rulers of the various countries of Europe, were  illiterate savages. The only reason that Asia wus not so  deeply involved in the night of, the dark ages, was, ils con-  querors, the Saracens, were far more enlightened than the  onquerors of the west. In some of tho countries of Europe,  tho ancient inhabitants were either driven out, or almost entirely extirpated. This was especially tho case in Britain.  But where tho ancient inhabitants were suffered to live, they  u-ere enslaved. The haughty master viewed the literature of  the slave as the. badge of that effeminacy which had resulted  in slavery. The wonder is, thai, under these circumstances,  literature should have lived at all. It is at tin's period, and  under these circumstances, that the monks are upbraided with  hiding the jcarning of the age from the community. Now  this is arrant injustice. They preserved lite inline from tclal  extinction, And so fat as I am able to-lenrn, tluy wcret-ver  ready to communicate their knowledge to those who were  willing to learn ; lot learning was. then a mere monkish accomplishment, and the lords of the land would net stoop to  acquire it. Now I am no apologist for monastic life; but I  protest against abusing tho monks for ihe only good thing  they ever did, the preservation of literature.  The truth, then, is this: Christianity took the savage hordes  of the north, and converted them into the present enlightened  and refined inhabitants of Europe and America. Nor shall  modern infidelity share the glory with her. It comes in, indeed, to attempt to share the spoil, when the victory is achieved. It bustles and fumes about founding a few colleges and  universities, as if it had laid the foundations of literature and  science; whereas it has only cpmo up in time to mar ihe lop-  stone. Infidel Fiance is appealed to us the modem light of  the world; But her self-styled illuminism set so soon in blood,  ihat the appeal is unfortunate. 1 should not fear to say, that  nine out of ten of all the literary foundations in the woild,  have been created by Christians. Let, then,,','her own works  praise her in the gates."  With these remarks, I beg leave to close this essay with the  sentiments of a highly esteemed member of this Lyceum:—  "Liberal government is the centrifugal force, which semis  colonies of civilized and enlightened men to people the world;  while religion acts as the centripetal force, to prevent such  Icolonies from becoming roving savages." 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/462	462	463.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/463.jp2

The writer is able to learn but little of the author of the  following extract, except that he was raised near West  Farms, in the neighborhood of New York city; that he was  graduated in Columbia College, and his medical education  completed in France; that he died of hereditary decline, nt  the early age of twenty-five years, leaving an infant daughter, who has recently published his manuscript poems. Who  would not envy her the melancholy, yet grateful office, of  thus commemorating the virtues.and perpetuating the literary  labors of a departed father, of whom death had robbed her,  ere her infant mind could appreciate his fostering kindness?  Let her, who would shrink from the sad undertaking, retire lo  the quiet of solitude, and peruse the little voliimo now before  us, and then return to acknowledge the pensive delight of an  orphan daughter, in thus conversing with the shades of a buried parent.  Several circumstances of interest, concerning this young  poet, are related by u correspondent of the New York Mirror, who had been visiting the home of Drake's youth, and  the lonely graveyard where he now lies. His grave is upon a  little knoll, in a beautiful green and retired spot, commanding  a view of Flushing bay, and "the green hills of Long Island." The writer in the Mirror learned, from an agetl man  of the neighborhood, that Drake had, from boyhood, been excessively fond of solitude. The spot where he nnd his sister  now rest together, and the banks ofthe Bronx, (a little stream  often mentioned in his poems,) were his favorite haunts. Upon the plain marble obelisk which marks his resting place,  is this simple inscription:  SACRED     TO    THE    MEMORY    Of  JOSEPH R. DRAKE,  WHO     DIED    SKI'TEMIIKR   21sT,   1H20, AGED 25   YEARS.

Mount Vernon, Saturday, Pec. 19, 1799.  This day being marked by an event, which will be memorable in tho history of America, and perhaps of the world, I  shall give a particular statement of it, to which I was an eyewitness.*  On Thursday, December 12th, the General rode out to his  farms about ten o'clock, nnd did not return home till past three.  Soon after he went out, the weather became very bad ; rajn  hail, snow, fulling alternately, with a cold wind. When he  came in, I carried some letters to him to frnnk, intending to  send them to the post-office in the evening.

But his neck appeared to be wet, and the snow was  hanging upon his hair. He came to dinner (which had been  waiting lor him) without changing his dress. In the evening, he appeared as well as usual.  A heavy fall of snow took place on Friday, which prevented the General from riding out as usual. He hud taken  cold, undoubtedly from being so much exposed the day before,  nnd complained of a sore throat. He, however, went out in  the afternoon, into the ground between the house and the  river, to mark some trees, which were to be cut down in the  improvement of that spot. He had a hoarseness, which increased in the evening; but he made light of it.  In the evening, the papers were brought from the post office, nnd he sat in tho pallor with Mrs. Washington and myself, rending them, till about nine o'clock, when Mrs. Wash-  ington went up into Mrs. Lewis's room, who was confined,  and left the General and myself rending the papers. He  was very cheerful, and when he met with any thing interesting or entertaining, he read it aloud as well as his hoarseness  would permit. He requested me to read lo him the Debates  of the Virginia Assembly, on tho election of a Senator and  Governor; nnd, on hearing Mr. Madison's observations respecting Mr, Monroe, he appeared much affected, and spoke  with some degree of asperity on the subject, which I endeavored to moderate, as 1 always did on such occasions. On  his retiring, I observed to him, that ho had better take something to remove his culd. Ho answered, "No; you know I  never take tiny thing for a cold.    Let it go as it came."  Between two and three o'clock on Saturday morning, he  awoke Mrs. Washington, and told her that he was very unwell, and had had an ague. She observed that ho could  scarcely speak, and breathed with difficulty, and would have  got up to call a servant. Hut he would not permit her, lest  she should take a cold. As soon as the day appeared, the  woman (Caroline) went into the room to make a fire, and  Mrs. Washington sent her immediately lo call me. I got  up, put on my clothes as quickly ns possible, nnd went to his  chamber. Mrs. Washington was then up, and related to me  his being ill, ns before stated. I found the General breathing  with difficulty, nnd hardly able lo inter a word intelligibly.  He desired Mr. Rawlins, (one of the overseers,) might be  sent for to bleed him, before the doctor could arrive. 1 despatched a servant instantly for Rawlins, and another for Dr.  Craik, and returned again to the General's chamber, where I  found him in the same situation as 1 had left him.  A mixture of molasses, vinegar, and butter was prepared,  to try its effects in the throat; but he could not swallow a  drop. Whenever he attempted it, he appeared to be distressed, convulsed, and almost suffocated. Rawlins came in soon  after sunrise, and prepared to bleed him. When the arm  was ready, the General, observing that Rawlins appeared to  be agitated, said, as well as lie could speak, " Don't bo afraid."  And when the incision was made, ho observed, "The orifice  is not large enough." However, (he blood ran pretty freely.  Mrs. Washington, not knowing whether bleeding was proper  or not, in the General's situation, begged that much might not  be taken from him, lest it should be injurious, and desired tne  to stop it; but, when I was about to untie the string, the Gen-  ernl put up his hand to prevent it, and, as soon as he could  speak, he said, " More, more." Mrs. Washington being still  very uneasy, lest too much blood should be taken, it was  Stopped, after taking about half a pint. Finding that no re.  lief was obtained from bleeding, nnd that nothing would tro  down the throat, I proposed bathing it externally with sal  volatile, which was done, and, in the operation, which was  with the hand, nnd in the gentlest manner, he observed, "It  is very sore." A piece of flannel, dipped in sal volatile,  was put around his neck, and his feet bathed in warm water,  but without affording any relief.  In the mean lime, before Dr. Craik arrived, Sirs. Wash,  ington desired me to send for Dr. Brown, of Fort Tobacco,  whom Dr. Craik had recommended to be called, if any case  should ever occur, that was seriously alarming. I despatched a messenger immediately for Dr. Brown, between eight  and nine o'clock. Dr. Craik came in soon after, and, urea  examining the General, he put a blister of enntharides m  the throat, took some more blood from him, and had a gargle  of vinegar and sage tea prepared) and ordered some vinegar  and hot water for him to inhale the steam of it, which he  did ; but, in attempting to use the gargle-, he was almost suffocated, When the gargle came from the throat, seme phlegm  followed, and he attempted to cough, which the doctor encouraged hlrri to do as much as possible; but he could only at-  tempt it. About eleven o'clock, Dr. Craik requested thai  Dr. Dick might be sent for, as he feared Dr. Brown would  not come in time. A messenger was accordingly despatched  for him About this time, the General was bled again. No  effect, however, was produced by it, and he remained in (he  same slate, unable to swallow any thing.  Dr. Dick came about three o'clock, and Br. Brown arrived soon after. Upon Dr. Dick's seeing the '. len ral, and con  suiting a few minutes wilh Dr. Craik, he wi s bled again.  Tho blood came very slow, was thick, and did not produce  tiny symptoms of fainting. Dr. Brown came into the chamber soon after, and upon feeling the General's pulse, the physicians went out together. Dr. Craik returned soon after.  The General could now swallow a little. Calomel and tartar emetic were administered, but without any effect.  Abouf half past four o'clock, he desired me to call Mrs.  Washington to his bedside, when he requested her to go down  into his room, nnd take from his desk two wills, which she  would find there, and bring them to him, which she did. Upon looking at them, he gave her one, which he observed was  useless, as being superseded by the other, and desired her W  burn it, which she did, and took the other and put it into her  closet.  After this was done, I returned to his bedside, and took hi*  hand. He said to me, " I find I am going. My breath cannot Inst long. 1 believed from the first, that the disorder  would prove final.

SAPPHO'S LEAP,  Oil,   A   SKETCH   UK  I.OVK  SOME THOUSAND  VEAI1S  400.  Not fur distant from Mitylene, was situated, some thousand  years ago, the beautiful villa of iho royal Churuxes. Altho'  it possessed not the exquisite decorations of some of our modern cotlages, yet it was a spot, thnt, in any age, would have  called forth a wish, from the most contented, to be its possessor ; so rich the shrubbery, so luxuriant the shade, and so  balmy the breeze that arose, from the beautiful bay before it.  At the time of which we write, two princely females were  the guardian angels of this lovely spot,—both matchless,—  the one in the beauty of her person, the other in the richness,  passion, and fire of her poetry—the lovely Rhodophe and the  incomparable Sappho. Others were there, fascinating and  beautiful; but they moved ns beings of another and a lower  order, when compared wilh the two we have mentioned.  The fame of Rhodopbe's beauty extended far and wide.  Her symmetry was ns exquisitely perfect, as Phidias could  have wished. There was a curl about her lips, that was inim-  table, and the strange and bewitching gnzu that flushed from  her dark, Grecian eyes, lured, fascinated,anil destroyed.

About eight o'clock, the physicians came again into the  room, and applied blisters and cataplasms of wheat bran to  his legs and feet, after which they went out, except Dr.- Craik,  without a ray of hope. 1 went out about this time, and wrote  a line to Mr. Law and Mr. Peter, requesting them to come  with their wives) Airs. Washington's granddaughters)as soon  as possible to Mount Vernon.  About ten o'clock, he made several attempts to speak to me,  Wore he could effect it. At length he said: "I am just going. Have me decently buried; and do not let my body be  put into the vault in less than three days after I am dead." I  bowed assent, for I could not speak. He then looked at me  again and said, " Do you understand ine? " 1 replied, "Yes."  "'Tis well," said he.  About ten minutes before he expired, which was between  ten and eleven o'clock,) his breathing became easier. He  lay quietly , he withdrew his hand from mine, and felt his  own pulse. I saw his countenance change. I spoke to Dr.  Craik, who sat by the fire.    He came to the bedside.    The  to search the world for its lovely owner.  The beauty of Sappho would not be considered us remarkable by the side of her companion; but when she struck her  golden lyre, a sttnrige music floated o'er the hind and the sea,  mid all who heard it wept, wondered, and admired.  " Thou sawest Phnon at the banquet, Sappho ?  " Yes."  "Is he not beautiful?"  " As perfect as the Narcissus, of whom the poets speak.  "Mi'thinks did I possess his faultless looks, I would gaze  upon the clear fountain, till I was in love with my own pretty  face, and then perhaps I would drown myself in perfect desperation.    But, in earnest, didst thou ever love, Sappho ? "  "Love!"  "Why this amazement?" said Rhodophe archly, "'tis  very plain, but I half believe, my dear companion, that thou  lovest this Phaon."  A crimson blush mantled upon the cheek of the Poetess.  "There is something in his looks, Rhodophe, methinks,  would fascinate any one.

Befienth a cluster of tall beeches, near the sea shore, tit  one end of the royal gardens, sat "the loved and the lover."  Tradition has talked much about the remarkable beauty of  Phaon, nnd its equally remarkable effects, making all hearts  yield in adoration and love. He was formerly a ferryman  between the isle of Lesbos and the shore of Asia. One morning, as his little bark lay moored in the harbor of Mitylene,  nn old woman applied to him for a speedy passage over lo  Asia. He readily complied, and hythe aid of oars and sail,  soon crossed the narrow strip of sen, that separated the island  from the continent. Upon landing, the old woman produced  a small box, and, delivering it to him, said, "Be this ihy ferriage: anoint thyself with the ointment, and then gaze upon  one of the clear springs of thy native isle, (for thou art, from  thy looks, too poor to possess a mirror,) and thou wilt toil no  more." The old woman quickly vanished to her heavenly  home, for it was the goddess of beauty in disguise.  The rough and awkward ferryman did as Venus commanded, and the ointment transformed his coarse proportions  to the most symmetrical figure. The world ne'er gazed upon a handsomer man than Phaon, and with his person also  changed his fortunes.  Book-worms and dreamers tell us, in strains almost ol  rhapsody, of the unequalled dominion of the intellect over  the affections. A high-soulccf, imaginative being, we believe,  would willingly lay the heart's rich treasures at the shrine ol  genius, but only such. Beauty's dominion is the most extensive and the most powerful. The heart, almost at its first  beat, feels the lively sensations of that power, and cherishes  them fondly, until its last pulsation. Wilh men like Phaon  whoso all is in their appearance, what can genius do? It  can command admiration, nnd even tears, but it cannot entwine itself around the affections of the heart. It is the soft  gaze of a lustrous eye; the low, sweet tone of voice, and the  little trickeries of attention, that fascinate and allure.  There was a softness in Rhodophe's voice, and a mildness  in her heavenly eyes, that few could withstand, and we need  not wonder that Phaon loved, even to the most desperate adoration. Perhaps the knowledge of his dominion over the affections of Sappho nnd her own power, prompted her to increase, by a thousand little attentions, the flame that was consuming him,  At first, the pride of being the lord of the affections of ihe  poetess, almost mastered him. He was always at her side,  heard with admiration the recital of her own sweet poetry,  nnd poured into her ears the sweetest strains of adulation and  of love. Rhodophe saw that vanityalone prompted him to pursue such a course, and succeeded, at length, in weaning entirely his heart and attention, and binding him irrevocably to her.  Rhodophe's hand was warmly clasped in his, and he was  drinking from her gaze the draught that gave life and buoyancy to his soul.  " I would talk to thee of our love, Rhodophe."  " Nay, do not, hut tell me of- Sappho."  "1 have not seen her for many days."  " I saw her last evening, in the garden, gazing upon the  silver moon.    As I approached her, I heard her sigh, and  nn thought she whispered, ' Phaon.'     1 placed my hand upon  her shoulder, and gazed full upon her face; but yet she Bmiled  not, as she was wont. A deep melancholy has shaded a]|  her feelings. Ah ! Phaon, 'tis you who have made her mjj.  erable. 1 would that she was loved as thou lovest me. Sh,,  would be happy."  "I cannot love her as I love thee, yet'tis misery to tl;,,];  of the intenseness of her love. Oh Rhodophe, hadst thou  been there when she told me the story of her love, thou  wouldst have wept nt the strange eloquence she used. She  told mi', while the tears trickled down her cheeks, and her  full heart seemed bursting with the effort, that when she saw  me, I appeared, (but only to her bright fancy, Rhodophe,) at  one equal to the gods; that when she heard me speak, hei  heart trembled in her bosom, she lost the power of speech, anil  her tongue was broken,—and, immediately, ihe gnnwings of  an inward fire consumed her. She saw nothing with y,  eyes,—a cold sweat remained upon her body, anil trenblio'i  seized her own frame. And, at length, she burst forth in a  flood of tears, and said, 'I am paler than the grass, and nol far  distant from the grave. My life seems leaving me; but, oh'  it must be borne, since I am miserable and poor." * Teats  came to my eyes, in spite of my manliness, and I u-Jshe.  that I could have loved her. But 1 told her that I loved  thee, and thee alone. She started, but she spoke not. Het  eyes seemed suddenly kindled, with an unearthly fire, am  melhought, that I would wither beneath its interiseness,-  Twas not, Rhodophe, the fire of anger, but it seemed of mail  nnd hopeless despair.  The sun was going down behind Leitcate. Upon thelal  white cliff's, that reared themselves proudly from the sea, was  seen the solitary form of a human being. Her white drapcrr  was beautifully relieved, by the brilliant sky of the eveninr.  She held in her hand a lyre, and its jewels caught the lustre  of the sun's last beams.  The stillness of the gtave was around that promontory  The sen bird had hushed its shrill cry, and the waves of ike  billowy Ionian seemed to sleep. Hark! a strain of the  sweetest music floated upon the evening zephyr. 'Twnsso::.  and would have reminded you of some buried affection,*  melancholy was the air. The sun went down, and the raiisi:  censed. With her long hair, streaming in the evening zephyr  and her hands uplifted towards heaven, she prayed to the  gods to look in mercy upon the sacrifice she was about to mate  and then she turned, and took a farewell look upon the beautiful Leucnelia, and then gazed upon the "deep, blue sen," bf-  fore, around, beneath her. For a moment, she stood with il  firmness of a statue, anil then gave one fearful spring,—cm  sullen plunge was heard,—and the waters of the Ionian  closed forever over the ill-fated and unhappy Sappho.

TO CORRESPONDENTS.

Will our correspondent please to be specific on this point, in all communications for ihe Journal 1  4  COUNTY CONVENTION OF TEACHERS.  We understand that there will be a Convention of Teachers, and other gentlemen of literary attainments, in the city of  Natchez, on Saturday, the 17th of March.  The object of the Convention will be. to enter into some  :."-ticnil arrangements Ibr the promotion of the interests of  education in Adams county, and to elect a delegation to meet  the State Convention nt the next session of that body. No  results but good ones can be anticipated from such a meetin  of the friends of education and moral improvement in this  anility.  p it ci j i; e: T r. n  -MILITARY,  SCIENTIFIC AND CLASSICAL  ACADEMY  We have understood that Professor Forshcy, of Jefferson  ( allege, proposes, if sufficient encouragement shall be given,  to open an academy in the city of Natchez, for the accomplishment of young gentlemen in the classics, mathematics, civil  engineering, and military tactics.

These noble volumes, are, at once tho best monument of the  " Father of his country," and of the perseverance, fidelity, and  research of the aci ompljshed biographer and historian, Jared  Sparks. The work is comprised in twelve volumes octavo,  of about 000 pages each, elegantly printed on fine paper, with  fine and beautiful binding. Each volume is illustrated by  engraved portraits, fac-simile's, plans nnd sketchings.  Sparks, in compiling the Life and Writings of Washington, has taken the best method—that of making the illustrious  man his own biographer. The style of his writings has he-en  faithfully preserved,—and, more than thai, it seems to have  been imitated by the compiler, in those connecting narrations  which fill up the chasms between detailed events, It is nil  like Washington,—plain, substantial, sensible, without nn  expletive for eflect, an ornament for display, or an excrescence  for the priming knife of a severer and more critical age,  The departments of record, in the governments of England  and Prance, were searched, by the indefatigable author, for  collateral oflicial correspondence, thus enabling him to settle  ach disputed point of cither policy or fact.  Sparks may truly say, "Exegi monumentum I"  We sincerely believe, that n well-trained body of classical  "ltd mathematical cadets would be the pride of the city andlmits of the bluffs, sweeping away from the view.

The  Mississippi, even'in its mildew moods, is terrible. When it  pours along ils dark waters, beneath the gentle gloamings of  a midsummer's sunset j or when its gliding ripples are burnished by the silvery effulgence of the midnight moon, its  course is still mighty—fearful, resistless; and we think of iis  fir, lonely journeying, and the scenes it has witnessed, and  we look upon its placid surf tee shadowed by the forests of its  banks, and it seems to us in all its majestic magnificence, only  as the giant slumbering from his labor.  Rut when (he beautiful spring time is over, arid the balmy  moonlit evening of summer is past, and Autumn's shadowy  glory is no more; when Winter broods over desolated nature, then it is that the "terrible Mississippi " assumes nil ils  fe'arfulness of aspect, and we realize ihat we are gazing upon  the mightiest stream, with but a single exception, that flows  upon our globe.

A notice in the Richmond Enquirer recommends the introduction of this metal into the currency, and gives the history  of its discovery, and such of its chemical and physical habitudes as relates to its use as a coin:  Platina, as it was called previous to the Into reformation  in chemical nomenclature, is a diminutive of plain, (silver,)  and was so named from its resemblance to silver. It was first  brought to the notice of the public by Don Ulloa, one of the  party who went to Peru to determine the figure of the earth,  who ascertained the existence of such a mclal in 1735. Hut  the honor of its discovery is mote generally awarded to Mr.  Wood, Assay Master of Jamaica, though his observations  were not printed until 1710, '50.

It is very malleable and ductile; laminablo: possesses considerable elasticity, and is susceptible of a very high  polish. It resists exposure to the weather even better than  silver or gold, and indeed its unalterability is not .surpassed  by any substance whatever. Its low equivalent number, OS,  (gold being 200,) and the utter impossibity of successfully  counterfeiting it, peculiarly recommend it for coinage.. Its  peculiar properties give it an intrinsic value for use in ihe  arts: so that its valtiu is inherent, and independent of any act  of Government, authorizing its use for coinage. In its value  it is intermediate between gold and silver, being about one-  third as valuable as gold, and five times as much so as silver.  It would form a most suitable material for coins of the different denominations, from one-to five dollars; and seems to  have been designed by nature expressly lo fill up this hiatus  and supply this acknowledged deficiency in our currency, li  will be found admirably to fulfil all the conditions laid down  by political economists, ns essential ton (it metal lor coin.  That it is well calculated to subserve the purposes of coin,  is also the opinion of some of the ablest chemists of Europe  and America. Dr. Silliman says, " it would be excellent for  coin." Mr. Park says, "it Would be very suitable for the fa.  bricalion of coins and metals, especially ns it is not injured by  acids, and would admit the most delicate impressions that a die  could possibly impart." The Russians have already availed  themselves of this metal for coinage in large quantities' and  it is fair to presume, that they prefer it to either of the other  precious metals; for, while they are converting platinum into money, the castles of St. Peter and St. Paul are filled with  gold and silver.  New York University.—The Law Faculty of i|us  flourishing Institution, (says the New Yorker,) is about to  be efficiently organized. The Council have determined on  the appointment of three Law Professors; and two of the  number have already been selected. The department of  Equity, Constitutional and International Law has been devolved on Hon. Benjamin F. Butler, Attorney General  of the United States, who will shortly resign his politic,-,)  station, to enter upon tho duties of his university appointment;  while the department of Pleading and Practice has been as-  signed to David Graham, jr., so well known to our citizens  as an eloquent and popular practitioner nt the bar. The pro  fessorship of Commercial Law and Personal Property, will  be filled in a few days, and the Law Faculty will enter upon  their duties on the first of April ensuing.  Genius and its Fame.—Genius, thou art like the ileiv  which descends from heaven in the darkness of night, nnd  which, invisible to nil eyes, yet gives strength lo the flower  and coolness to its nectar, the whole night long. But when  the sun throws round its fiery rays, they drink up the dew,  md tho flower hangs its drooping head. Genius, thou art  ike the dew! While guarded within the breast, thy influence is to cool and strengthen it, but when thy bright ray!  ire cast upon the world, ihott faclest into naught, and leaves  behind thee a withered  and a drooping heart.—Paul Jean.  ICELAND presents the curious contrast ofnnarclic country  enclosed in "thick-ribbed ice," and emitting streams of molten lava nnd sulphur from within its burning caverns that arc  thus encrusted with ice,  "The volcano called Skupter Joklll, in Iceland, in the year  1783, sent out two great streams of lava, one of which was  fifty miles in length, from ten to fifteen in breadth, nnd the ordinary depth about ono hundred feet, but in some deep valleys  it was more than five hundred feet, The other was forty  miles long, seven wide on the average, and about the same  depth as the first."  Potash from Beet Root.—Anew discovery hasbeen  made in France, to produce potash in such quantities from the  residuum of beet root, alter making the sugar, ns to threatens  rivalry with the produce of tho American forests. M. I&gt;  brunfaut is the discoverer. The molasses, after serving for  the making of sugar, is distilled to obtain alcohol. The re-  mainih r is then, instead of being thrown away, manufactured  into potash. The quantity of potash furnished by Mr. Die  brunfaut's process is one-sixth of the quantity of sugar extracted from the beetroot. Thus, says the Journal des Debats,  taking the amount of indigenous sugar manufactured each  year at 40,000,000 of kilogrammes, there may besides be extracted from the beet root, which has served for that production, 7,000,000 kilogrammes of saline matter, comparable to  the best potash of commerce, and this, too, without the loss  of the alcohol, and other produce, the fabrication of which  must be continued simultaneously. According to present  prices, the 7,000,000 of kilogrammes represent a value «'■  from 5,000,000 to 0,000,000 of francs— Washington (''*■ 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/468	468	469.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/469.jp2

MoNsrru, SI. 1).  CONVINCED.  1.   The Miasm of Yellow Fevek.—This we consider as a subtile, gaseous, invisible, and inodorous matter, generated by the action of the sun, or by solar heat, upon the atmosphere, independently of any effluvia or fcetor from the decomposition of animal matters, and independently of any exhalations from marshes, dry earth, or vegeto-animal compounds, or  any thing of those kinds.  We believe it to be the result of some  unknown combination of the solar rays, with the atmosphere,  which takes place at all times and in till places, whilethctem  peraturein the shade is steadily between 8S°and 0S°of Full  reiilieit, or between 110° and 130" in the open sun : thatiti  specific gravity is much greater than that of common air, and  that it possesses the common properties of aerial lluids.     We  think it probable, that, in its simple stale of miasm, il is innocuous; bul becomes morbific by combination with impure air;  that commonly it becomes separated from pure air, and settles  near the ground; that it is partially neutralized by a temper-  alureof 6,r)° or 60°; and is entirely destroyed by a tempera-  lure of 50° or 45° at the lowest.    The degree of its morbific  qualitii s depends upon the nature and degree of combination.  Hence, in our opinion, it can accumulate in dangerous  quantities only when the weather is steadily between 88" and  98s during the day, and above 00° or 70? at night, and during a period when there is but little wind to disperse it, or  only sufficient lo wall it gently in the air, and cause it to settle  in low confined places, in a manner similar to the collections  of carbonic acid gas.    We think, unless the weather is unusually calm and sultry, or  remarkably warm, to cause its  rapid formation, that it requires from ten to fifteen days for it  to accumulate sufficiently to be in any wise prejudicial; that  sliong winds sweep it away, or diffuse it in the general air;  and heavy rains wash it partly ofT, or cause it lo settle in low,  damp places, and dei p buyoux;  where, in a long succeeding  calm, hot period of weather, it will accumulate until they  overflow, and s  nnd it over the surrounding gtounds near  their margins: that it assumes a level surface, like water, nnd  hence is deeper in some points than al others, in proportion to  their relative elevation: that it cannot accumulate on steep declivities without a barrier below, when it rises only to the levei  «l the barrier.  On perfectly level surfaces, it seldom raises its  surface more than three or four feet above the ground, and most  commonly not more than two or three  feet.    A cold night,  with a temperature below 50°, would destroy all that had  previously generated;   a   strong wind   or   tornado  would  sweep it out from buyoux, ravines, or low confined places,  Hot weather favors its formation; calm weather favors ils  accumulation, as well as the contamination of ihe air requisite to form a morbific union with the miasm.  We believe it requires for its formation an extreme temperature above 88°, because unless the temperature has been up to  that point during the hottest period of the day, for many  days, no yellow fever has occurred; whereas, although the  temperature of the nights may have been up to 80° or above,  so that the menu temperature is 80° or 82°, yet if the great-  est heat of the day has not been up lo 88° at least, there is  no yellow fever.    Again, a few days may give an extreme  temperaturo of 00° or 95s; yet if one or two cool nights, at  a temperature of 50° or 55° succeed, there will be no yellow  fever for ten days subsequently at least.    Again, there might  be thirty days in succession, with nn extreme temperature as  high as 03? or 05", and yet two cold nights, ten or fifteen days  apart, would neutralize nil the miasm previously formed; and  although the mean heal, for a month or lunger, might average  more than 80", there would be no yellow fever.    Hence the  wean heat should not be taken into our estimates; but the  actual temperature by day and  by night.    The wii.ds may  be fresh from the south, so ns not to reduce the temperature  below 00? by day, nnd yet they may carry off all the miasm,  or all the contaminated air: or a calm, hot day, may be succeeded by a gale at night, which will carry oil' the miasm.  This miasm is not injured or neutralized by damp air: on  the contrary if calm, damp, foggy, cloudy, or misty weather,  succeed ninnydays of intensely hot and sultry weather, the  miasm previously formed, remains, if it does nol accumulate;  damp, moist air is congenial to it, and seems to attract il: or it  settles over low, damp places, in preference to dry ones of the  same elevation.    Hence it accumulates in deep ravines or  bayoux.     Upon these  principles, we perceive why yellow  fever is most prevalent in low, damp sections of cities, near  the wharves and about the shipping.    These places attract  and retain the miasm already formed: as well as favor its  generation and preservation.    The temperature about such  places, from their exposed situation, is often nt least two or  three degree's higher than in other parts ofthe city.    The  reflection from the water adds to this eflect byelny.nnd moderates the cold by night.    ThrTtemperature of the country air  s generally at least two or three degrees less than it is in any  closely built parts of cities, not only during the day, but at  night; country air is necessarily much cooler, because there  is not such an accumulation of heat in radiating bodii's.  Although it requires a temperature above SS* to generate  miasm, we find that it requires a reduction of nearly one-half  to neutralize or destroy it. Hence yellow fever is often endemic nil the year in the West Indies; for there the temperature of the air is seldom below 55° of Fahrenheit, and where  infection, exists, even that temperature will not destroy it.  These facts may be illustrated by similar ones in relation to  another fluid, Thus water, for example, under the common  atmospheric pressure, will not boil at 200° or 205" Fahrenheit; but it will boil at 212°.

To eflect  ihis, it must be reduced ton temperature but littieaboveonelhird  of that which has been nccessary.to convert it into steam; and  by reducing the temperature to one-half of the last, it becomes  solid. Somewhat similar may it not be with the miasm of  yellow fever? It seems to require a temperature of 120° in  ihe sun, or 88° or 90° in the shade, to generate it; although  it is destroyed by a temperature as low as 50°.  We suppose this miasm innocuous, when uncombintd, because we find during the hotti st weather in cities, when the  thermometer at mid-day ranges between 90° and 95" in the  shade, there will be no yellow fever, while the air is sufficiently agitated with winds to carry off the air which has been  freely respired, and is freely charged with exhalations from  living bodies: for, although the miasm may be generating  rapidly at such times, there is no tendency towards yellow  lever, until the air becomes stagnant, and often respired, and  charged with animal exhalations: when it seems to acquire  new properties and new virulence. We know that but a  a short time In fore nn epidemic begins to prevail, the most  perfect health often prevails among those who become the  fust victims; although, at other times, cases of common bilious  remittents are the harbingers of the epidemic. The hitter,  wc believe, occurs only after much hot, damp weather, and  tic former after hot and dry weather.  We suppose that this miasm is not morbific per sc; that it  separates itself from pure, free air, nnd settles to tho lowest  places; but that it combines actively with impure air, especially such as has been frequently respired; and thus it becomes a more active cause of disease. When thus combined,  we call it malaria or infectious air; and in this Mate it is a  predisposing cause of disease, as well as a suitable nidus for  infection, In this infectious air, infection will spread, and  yellow fever may be disseminated among the people, by exciting causes of a mild kind, or without any. Winn thus combined with contaminated air, it becomes more volatile than  before, and diffuses itself more generally in the atmosphere,  although it is still heavier than common air, and remains  about those places which collect and retain the miasm.  II. Infectious Ant or Malaria. This combination,  when not concentrated, or v. hen n.oeh rait Iy diluted with free  air, conveysa very slight predisposition to yellow fever: but  when concentrated by close, sultry weather, in a dense population, ihe predisposition will bo so strong that sporadic cases,  under highly exciting causes, will occur; especially among  strangers, and those who are unaccliinated. Those who are  acclimated escape. If many sporadic cases occur, wo may  infertile existence of malaria or infectious air, and without a  change in tho weather, such^as a reduction of temperature',  winds, or a rain-storm, we may expect yellow fever to become  epidemic. Each case appeals to haste n on the e pidi mic, as if  it wero by imparting some deleterious property to the impure  air at different points, and thus forming finally a fermentative  coalescence. If several of tin se sporadic cases occur in the  same vicinity, as it will do if there he many unacclimuted  foreigners together, tin; disease will begin to spread from thai  point.    Others who are unacclimateel, will be attacked without  any highly exciting cause, and finally without any excitino  cause except the infectious air about them, which has gradually become infected. When the air becomes highly inficteei,  it appeals to be more volatile and in some manner diffusej  Itself more readily than when in the form of miasm alonf|  or even of malaria, and it doubtless does possess the power of  extending or reproducing itself.  Tho impure air, which unites with miasm, and forms the  infectious air, which is the proper basis for receiving and t\.  tending the infection, is dependent, we think, chiefly upon the  effects produced upon common air at a high temperature, by  respiration and animal exhalations, especially from human  bodies. This prepares it for the union with miasm. Thus  from miasm the first degree of contamination is effected In  exhalations from healthy bodies in a high temperature; tha  second by the accumulated exhalations from bodies laboriiif  under high grades of yellow fever; or, by a much greater  concentration ofthe morbific properties, which appears to lake  place after, but not before the sporadic cases occur.  Our reasons for believing that respiration and cutaneous  exhalations effect the morbid change in the air, to form malaria, are principally as follows:  1. Thnt sultry weather is always necessary lo produce  malaria, and to cause yellow fever to spread when infected air  has been introduced, I have in no case found yellow fever  to become epidemic at any place shortly after it had been thoroughly swept out by a storm, unless in cases whore infected  uir had been previously generated and retained in the houses.  Stagnant air, when exhausted by men and animals, is as destructive to health and life in them, as stagnant water is lo  fish, when overstocked. Running water always affords a  change for fish; and in the large masses of water, they  change their places in it. So with air, where from the confined situation of a city or district, or from the nature of ihe  buildings and enclosures, or from a general and protracted  stagnation of the atmosphere, the air is not sufficiently renewed, it becomes more or less morbific, by being breathed  repeatedly and charged with animal exhalations.  2. When there are sufficient winds to sweep out the avenues and streets of cities frequently during summer, there ii  mi yellow fever generated as an epidemic, although the actual heat, as indicated by the thermometer, may beat least three  or four degrees higher, than it is in sultry weather, when  yellow fever begins. This is confirmed by the history of  every epidemic yellow fever which we have been able to «■  amine, either in the United States or the West Indies.  3. We know that yellow fever, during our epidemics, prevails especially along the margins of the large and deep ravines or bayoux, which originate around the city, and spread;  mostly in the space embraced in the declivities towards the."'  ravines. The miasm sctth s in them at till times; and the ait  contaminated by exhalations and respirations of the contiguous population, in sultry, calm weather, settles in these declivities, and the infectious air becomes more concentrated neat  the margins of the ravines, and especially in their channels.  Gentle breezes, after a long, sultry, calm spell, will sweep  over the tups of ihe houses and points of ihe hills, but will  not sweep out these bayoux; at most they will agitate str1 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/471	471	472.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/472.jp2

In  proportion to the distance and the range of elevation above  the declivity to the margin of the ravine, so is the immunity  of persons.  1. There are other bayoux and ravines, equal to those  nlinut Natchez, in the country, but, although they may and do  jreneralc miasm as fast as those near and in Natchez, they  do not produce yellow fever; because they have not the population to contaminate the air, and cause it to combine with  (ho miasm, so as to produce yellow fever malaria. On those  leiyoiix or deep ravines in the country, we find only common  erratics of bilious fever; which is produced by the union of  marsh exhalations with miasm.  ",. The same principles are illustrated by the facts connected with epidemic yellow fevers in cities differently situated from Natchez; where, instead of bayoux, there are other  low surfaces to accumulate the malaria.  ij. The same principle is fully sustained in the production  of yellow fever on boar.l large ships at sea, crowded with  human beings, as line of battle ships: these become infected  at sen, only when there is a continuation of hot, calm, sultry  weather. At other times, only bilious fever will eiecur in  liii'in. This mularia, in common seasons, may generate so  slowly, or be so slightly concentrated, as to produce no active  without miasm, will produce fever; and the same at a low  temperature will produce common typhus, jail, and ship fever.  The same with miasm in a hot climate will produce yellow  lever. Tlio most rapid effects from exhausted air on record,  are those of the hundred and forty-six Englishmen, confined  in the " black-hole " at Calcutta, of whom all but twenty-three  died in less than eighteen hours, with all the symptoms of a  most malignant and areh nt fever, produced solely from exhausted air charged with human effluvia,  The general atmosphere sometimes in hot, sultry weather,  seems to possess this vivifying property in a less degree than  common. This state of the atmosphere is indicated by n  sense of oppression under which all animals appear lo labor,  is evinced by the relaxation of the skin, and profuse perspiration; and the rapid respiration or panting, especially after  even moderate exercise.  When this sensible condition of the air exists longer than n  very few days, with a temperature during the day ranging  between 88" and 95° in the shade, and from 80" to 85" nt  night, with a calm or serene atmosphere, whether cloudy,  foggy, smoky, or hazy, we may be sure the miasm is accumulating, and especially in cities, the air is rapidly becoming  contaminated, and will lend cin to nn epidemic yellow fever,  without a change. This crisis maybe expedited by the intro-  lisease.    While in this stale, like other poisons, tho whololduction of infected air, or of patients laboring uiulei yellow  population of a city may be respiring it in such small quantities, (hut they not only feel no inconvenience, but they actually, by habitual exposure to it in its diluted suite, acquire an  immunity to its effects, even when it becomes more concentrated. The same immunity to its action is obtained by the  development of the disease, provided it be so mild as not lo  destroy life. This eflect is produced by blunting the sensibility to its action,.similar to that produced by a continued use  of uident spirits.' Those who have undergone this acclimating, will remain unharmed during an epidemic, while strangers and non-residents will he cut oil' rapidly by the disc use.  When the malaria of common seasons becomes concentrated  fever, &lt; )r if many persons in the city go on board a boat or  vessel which is infected, and subsequently are attacked with  yellow fever in the city, (luring the continuance of such a  slate of the weather ns we have alluded to above, we may expect other cases lo spring up in their vicinity; and, without u  timely change of weather, the local air will become so infected as to spread tho disease to others. This is what is termed  by some "an epidemic constitution of the air"—for nil admit  that, at certain times, infection of yellow fever, as well as of  other diseases, will spread rapidly—and, at other limes, it  will not spread nt nil.  J'lius we believe that the union of miasm with air exhausted  hj a continuation of hot, sultry weather, or by numerous by. respiration, and charged with human and animal exhaia-  sporadic cases of strangers, or by infected air introduced, tjons&gt; jn a hot temperature, produces the malaria of yellow  ihe epidemic  follows.      Sometimes, doubtless, an epidemic fevcr. and that this may be more or less concentrated, and e.l  might be avoided, were it not for imprudent exposure to eom-  ci'in exciting causes, which, in such a time, give additional  power to the malaria, by preparing the system to its action;  li by diminishing the powers of the system to reahsl its operation.  We have said the air was exhausted by respiration in sultry  weather, in addition to the animal exhalations with which it  is charged. Doubtless respiration is one of the most potent  sources of contamination to the air, when confined. Whether this contamination proceeds from any new principle or  property imparted lo iho air from the lungs, as carbonic acid  gas, ammoniacal gas, or nitrogen; or by depriving it of any  property known to chemistry, wo presume not to decide. But  We believe it is exhausted, to u certain extent, of the vitalizing  principle, the "pabulum viltr," and nt the same time contaminated with animal effluvia. Hence the necessity of winds and  Murms to carry off these matters and replace fresh air. Air  exhausted by respiration and charged with animal effluvia  course more or less morbific : that when to this is superadded  n sufficient portion of the morbid exhalations of yellow fever  patients, il produces the third degree of the morbific agent of  yellow fever; viz:  III. Infection. This appears to possess properties differing from those of the malaria in several particulars. It  seems to possess, in addition to its morbific properties, the pro  perty or quality of assimildting to its own nature any impure  or confined air into which a suitable portion of the infection  is introduced. Thus the whole air in a room or ship's hold,  when properly prepared for the prolific reception of the infection, will, in a short lime, be converted into an infected air  equally as strong and active) as tho small portion first introduced. From its analogy to common ferment, 1 have called it  gaseous ferment, meaning that change which my friend Or.

This  eflect will be greatly expedited by introducing into tho basis  so prepared a portion of ferment or leaven; although the  same effect would be produced without it after a longer time.  When the fermentative process is complete a portion of the  fermentated basis introduced into another basis in a suitable  temperature, will excite tho same action ; and so on ad infinitum. This ferment, although it require a temperature  from 70° to 80° for its production, is not destroyed when  once produced, by any moderate change of temperature'. II  a portion of this leaven be introduced inlo an unsuitnbL  basis, at an improper temperature, it will bo neutralized and  lost.  So il appears to us is the gaseous ferment of yellow fever.    It requires a basis of impure air, exhausted by respiration, and charged with human effluvia, at a regular temperature for a certain time, to produce it in the first place:  but when a portion of the infection already formed in another place is   introduced, the   assimilating   process   takes  place much sooner, and probably without the same degree  of heat or contamination that would be necessary to generate it ah initio.    This "leaven" of infection when introduced into several points ol a malarious district, will much more  certainly institute the assimilating  process, than if it were  introduced at one or two points only, and in small quantities.  If introduced into pure air it becomes neutralized and lost.  Upon this principle we may explain why it is so necessary to desert an infected district, to check the spread of th  disease; for thereby, wo  not only prevent the formation  ofj  the malaria, or basis, but likewise remove the sources of in  fection or " leaven."    The air becomes more pure by removing those who contaminate it, and new cases of fever in  the contaminated air, or malaria, are prevented.    If this precaution is taken soon after the first few cases, before the gen  eral air of a district becomes infected, the spread of the dis  case may be arrested : for in ten or twelve days where res  piration has been suspended or intermitted, the air loses its  peculiar adaptation for supporting the assimilating proces:  The fermentative process ceases for want of a suitable basis;  and the miasm settles down near the ground in ils simple  harmless state, or is waited off by winds.    But if the popu  lation remain contaminating the air at such time, until it be  comes infected, rains may wash portions of it inlo bayoux,  nnd winds may sweep all infected air from the streets, bul  there will remain sufficient of the infected air in the houses  and  enclosures to institute the fermentative process a"ain  from a hundred sources.  The properties of infection, or infected air, so far as can  be ascertained are as follows, viz :  1. It is a gaseous poison which is diffused in the air at  certain times, or mny bo contained in confined air of houses,  ships, and even in bales of goods. It is more volatile than  simple miasm or infectious air; and diffuses itself further and  insinuates itself more intimately and extensively in the at  mosphere of a city; and when concentrated produces yellow  fever in its most malignant forms, in from three to five days  from the exposure, without any exciting cause. To bring  the system under its influence, it is neccssan only to breathe  it for a few minutes, or an hour or two, according to tlle  degree of concentration. It so acts through the nervous system, upon the whole of the vital functions, as to produce a  malignant fever, which mostly terminates indeath, alter from  one to five days.  2. When a suitable quantity of it is introduced into the  proper kind of air, at a suitable temperature, without the free  admission of pure air, it acts as a ferment, and re-proelures  a larger amount of infection, equally efficient with that first  introduced. In this way it will assimilate the contiguous air  and diffuse itself as extensively as the malaria. A large  amount of it introduced, will bo diffused in an atmosphere  less contaminated than actual malaria, and assimilate, or render infected a much greater amount of air. Although a  small quantity diffused in a pure atmosphere so as to become  much diluted, loses its fermentative properties, as wellasiis  morbific.  These properties we find indicated by the infection having  become as virulent as ever in a few days after a severe gale  or storm must necessarily have swept off all the loose infection from the open air. The infected air in each house is a  source for re-infecting the general air of the city or infected  district.  3. When air is moderately infected, so ns not lo produce  active disease, by being closely confined, tit a temperature between 85" and 05" it becomes more virulent in a few days.  This is confirmed (luring every epieh mic, in this known  fact, viz: that a house may be deserted early in the epidemic, when the infection in the general air is weal; so as  not to have excited disease in any of its occupants: yet when  they have fled, and the house has been closed for a month  or longer, if any of those same members, or others from the  country return to that house, occupy it, nnd sleep in it without proper ventilation and exposure to cold or frost, they trill  contract yellow fever of a high grade and probably die. The  air contained in In ils h ft in such houses has bcin more closely confined than the free air ofthe room, and nta more regular temperature, and of cntiise is more virulent.  It is upon this principle as well as that of section 2nd, thai  cleanliness and ventilation are so essentially neeessaiy ntent  patients laboring under yellow fever, list it may accumulate  in a stagnant air and become a new source of infection. Fofi  as Dr. Paloni, of Naples, observes, of the yellow fever ol  Leghorn, which swept of!'seven hundred souls in thnt city in  the autumn of 1804 : " The infi ction of this fever is of such  a constitution, thnt pure and renewed air decomposes its /(WW  it a small distance from the sick: on the other hand, air that  stagnates and is replete with animal exhalations, easily '""  comes a vehicle for it. Hence it happens thnt as soon ns lb  disorder broke out, wc saw it rage most fierci ly in the ine-'!  filthy nnd least ventilated pails of the city. Pvre.freslh'1'  ncwed air destroys its infection." Med. Repository, vol. &  p. 426—7, &c.  In this case the Doctor's views are correct, and unusual'? 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/473	473	474.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/474.jp2

Hence the wisdom  of free ventilation with the sick, as inculcated by all who  have been conversant wilh this fever; and the reason why  it is not known to spread, in a country air; and why in u  city the malignity of the cases and the succession of cases  increase with each case attacked in sultry hot weather, unless the people fly.  ,1. When infected air is confined in rooms, &c. it is not  destroyed by any degree of cold short of 40" Furtnheit; and  lo destroy it entirely nothing short of 32° will suffice.  Hence it often occurs that the infected air of houses produces yellow fever in those entering them even after feost  and ice; for a mild frost will take place at 40°—and al  though the temperature in the open air may be reduced to  3&gt;\ yet the temperature in closctl rooms is most probably  not below 40' or 45 J. To destroy infection requires the temperature reduced 15J or 20" lower than is requis.te to neutralize simple miasm.  5. This infected air is supposed lo be more volatile thai  miasm to be volatilized by the sun and partially condensed  in the cool dews of night: hence when there is much infection in the air it may be more dangerous to be out at  night than in meridian day. Thus the night-watches gen  orally suffer severely.  (j. The infection insinuates itself into blankets, feather-  beds, woollens, and other porous articles, and in this way  may be carried from one place lo another. But the infected air thus transported will produce ihe disease only in  those who breathe it before it is diluted with common air:  it might spread when taken into a close room and kept in  stagnant warm air.  7. Like miasm it is heavier than common air; and settles in low damp places, and bayoux; so that when there is  but a moderate quantity in the general air it abounds i.i such  places, in proportion to their depth and width, and the declivity to tii ir margins, until its surface conies upon a level  with tn.it diffused abroad. Thus when abundant it may be  ten feet deep near tho margin of a bayou, and not more than  three feet deep one hundred yards distant.  8. It is mpposed to adhere in some manner to wood and  such like bodies, especially, more than to brick, stone, plus-  tor, etc. Hence we find wooden houses more frequently become infected and remain so even after one or two frosts; because it is more tenacious of wood, which maintains a highci  specific temperature than stone or brick walls. Hence the  great difficulty of disinfecting ships until cold weather completely neutralizes the properties of the infection.  We will here make a few remarks again upon the generation of miasm on board ships in tropical climates. Tin  confined air in the holds of ships is more likely to be exhausted by respiration, nnd charged with human effluvia than  even a city ; especially where there are many souls on board,  who aie often confined below on account of storms and  winds.    In them thorough ventilation is extremely difficult,  and the temperature is almost constantly up to the miasm  point. The infectious air is thus rapidly formed in many  cases, and in this state, a vessel arriving at n port where yel.  low fever prevails, will be ready to receive the leaven fiom  the infected air of the city, either by the crew visiting the infected districts on shore or by the introduction of the infection in the form of fomes in goods. The United States frigate General Greene, before referred to, is a good illustration.  The temperature at sea in tropical latitudes is seldom below 80' of Fahrenheit, and often from 90' to 100' according  to the degree of reflection and concentration ofthe sun's rays.  By a register kept by Dr. Thos. Rodman,* embracing thirty observations between the first of November and the fifth  of December, at 12 o'clock M. each day, between latitude  22" north, nnd 22" south, it was ascertained that the lowest  temperature of the air was 79' and the highest in the shade  SO"'. The lowest temperature of the si a below the surface  was 78 =, and the highest 84°. 'Ihe mean temperature of  the air timing that time, at 12 AI. was 83", nnd ofthe water  81° Thus the temperature within vessels while in tropics  cannot be low enough to destroy or neutralize miasm, much  less infection: the former requiring a temperature of 50°  and the latter of 32e Fahrenheit. Thus, however slowly it  may be generated, it continues to accumulate until the ship  enters a northern climate. Tin's register was kept during a  cool healthy season, when no disease was generated on Loaid,  by hot, culm and sultry weather: of course a much higher  temperature in these respects is often experienced on board  ships in the tropics; and the miasm and infectious air is often generated where no animal or vegetable putrefaction  exists.  The generation of miasm in cities, as has been before remarked, has taken place under every variety of circumstance  us regards animal or vegetable decomposition; as well as  where neither existed. Under all the circumstances which  have been presented to our view, we cannot conceive it possible for such a general morbific agml, lo be eliminated liom  such a diversity of sources and each so limited in their nature  and extent as those to which it has been ascribed. As well  might we expect to see a territory inundated by a rivulet as  to believe the atmosphere of a city should be infected with a  pestilential miasm from a few bushels of rotten coffee, a few  barrels of oysters, a dead horse, or a filthy back yard. The  cause is inadequate to ihe effect. If so small a cause could  produce such general effects it would be an anomaly in nature'.  Besides, it would be strange beyond comprehension if a  peculiar miasm, could be generated from a hundred different  sources, nnd under as many different circumstances: for the  causes and circumstances necessary for the production of yellow fever, as generally maintained by the advocates of vegetable or animal putrefaction, are almost innumerable. In  medical investigations ns well ns in some othcis, we arc too  ipt lo direel our attention exclusively to a few apparently  prominent circumstances, which strike some of our senses,  '■■•■■Ait  [A. ;wm  V;!'iT:  m  ;■  m  m  I  ■  i  vh  • Vide Coxc's Medical Museum, vol.

Hence it happens, that in attempting to trace  the secret cause of yellow fever miasm, as it is called, we  have been led so often to thoso things which are offensive to  our senses; notwithstanding the same exist equally when no  yellow fever prevails; and notwithstanding the poison of yellow fever cannot bo detected by any of our senses.  We doubt not, the precursor most essential to yellow fever  epidemics, at Natchez, as well as elsewhere, will be found to  be hot, calm, sultry weather, for ten or fifteen days in succession, immediately before it breaks forth. If no infected air  be introduced, the disease will not manifest itself in so short  a period as otherwise, nor in air as slightly contaminated as  otherwise. We conceive the vicissitudes of weather, whatever they may have been a month or six weeks previously, have  no immediate effect upon ils production. In all probability,  the effects necessary for an epidemic are elaborated principally within twenty days or less, immediately previous to the appearance of the epidemic. Although the miasm is elaborating continually during hot weather, it never accumulates in  such quantities as to produce disease, until after several hot,  calm, sultry days, during' which time also, the air, being stagnant, becomes exhausted and charged with exhalations. If  altera week or ten days of clear, hot, sultry weather, calm,  cloudy, or foggy weather succeed, nt an extreme temperature  during the day, of 85" to 05", the miasm Still continues to accumulate, though more slowly, until strong winds or cold  nights succeed. Upon this principle, do we account for yellow (ever having prevailed in calm, cloudy, or wet weather,  although it did not appear during the previous hot and dry  weather.  The most common appearances observed in the weather,  immediately preceding yellow fever, are as follows; viz : the  temperature in the shade, from 88" to 05" at noon, with warm  nights, for ten or fifteen days, at least, in succession. During  this time, whether the weather be clear or cloudy, or attended  with moderatj rains, the air is not agitated by any stronc  winds, such as sweep out every part of a city; the air feels  oppressive, and respiration is oppressive. Durinn- such  times, especially in August and September, every precaution  should be observed, until a change of weather ensues; a por  tion of the population should disperse; strangers and unaccli  mated persons should leave the city, all unusual exposure  should be avoided, all fatigue, debauch, or intemperance, or  irregular hours, shoubl be strictly avoided, nt least until after  u favorable change of weather. Every precaution necessary  to keep up a proper equilibrium of tho healthy functions  should be punctiliously observed by those who value their  lives above a few dollars, or above temporary sensual gratifications. This remark is especially applicable to those who  are properly unaccliinated.  I shall now proceed to give a sketch of tho history of the  different yellow fever epidemics of Natchez, with a few remarks relative to each.  '-. The EnnEMicoF 1817 is considered as the first in the I  history of Natchez; although I have been very credibly in.  formed,, that individual cases were often seen previously  :ome of which, I have been informed, appeared to have ori'  ginated in the city; and others derived their infection from  New Orleans, or from infected boats. Dr. Tooley informs  me that occasional cases occurred about the city in 1817, a,  early as July and August; it did not become epidemic, how-  ever, until the 28th of September. Dr. Perlee* says th,  stuie ofthe weather had been such as predisposed very strong,  yto violent disease, even in the early part of September,and  'required only a small concentration of power to produce i  sweeping epidemic." "At this lime," says he, " when lb,  population was highly susceptible, the Washington steam.  boat reached us from New Orleans, with persons on board ill  of yellow fever; some of whom were landed; and several  young men from town went on board, who were all taken  sick soon after and died. The disease spread rapidly, am!  with most destructive malignity. For some time it hadii!  sway over the whole city. On the 28th of September, tli,  physicians publicly announced the existence of yellow fever.  :mel a large portion of the population retired to the country."  On the 1st of October, the President of the Selectmen, EJ  ward Turner, issued a circular, advising the citizens to seel;  refuge in the country, and regretting, at the same time, lljl  the disease had been in the city several (lays before it wusaii-  nounced. The disease continued to prevail among those win  remained until about the 9th of November; nnd severs!  cases occurred among those who returned us late as '.lie loll  of that month.  The whole number of deaths in the city (lining tliiscpi  demic, was one hundred and thirty-four, besides somendio  contracted the disease in the city and died in the country. Dr.  Perlee States that the number was estimated about three hundred : but that is doubtless an exaggerated estimate. The  population of the city at that time was comparatively small.  The epidemic commenced late, nnd terminated rather early  From a meteorological table given by Dr. Perlee, it aj-  pears that the mean temperature of July was 80°, of August  77°, of September 73°. The quantity of rain up to the lint  of September, was rather more than usual; being in July  3-95 inches; in August 4-41 inches: in September l-W  inches. I have not been able to ascertain what was the daily  extreme temperature of September; although Dr. Pen1"  informs us it was a hot, sultry, an 1 humid month.  Tho "predisposing causes," to which Dr. PerleeascriW  this epidemic, are exhalations from city filth ; from ground)  newly made in leveling tho streets; from stagnant water in  the streets and cellars; from the old grave-yard near the centre of the city. These various exhalations, he supposed  produced a high state of "general predisposition," and will  "other causes of insalubrity" prepared the inhabitants fora»  epidemic, so soon as any exciting cause should occur, orw  soon as any concentration of power should take place in tl&gt;&lt;  predisposing cause.

Immediately after these cases the disease manifested itself in various parts of tho city.  The yellow fever prevailed severely in New Orleans, in  1,617, for several weeks previous to its appearance in Natchez.  II, Tiik Epidemic of 1819.    The first alarm of yellow-  fever was given on the 4th of September, ut which time several cases had occurred, and a portion of the citizens immediately fled to the country.    Cases became more  frequent,  and more malignant in their type until the 14th of September,  when it was considered epidemic.    It continued to prevail  with great mortality until the first of December.    At this  time about 200 persons of all kinds had fallen victims to ils  ravages, and the total number of cases was over 400.    Some,  nsin 1817, died after they had fled to the country; and others after they had returned to their homes, and imprudently  slept in their houses and beds before they were perfectly disinfected by cold weather.    The total deaths as given in the  sexton's reports, during tho epidemic, in the city, were about  one hundred and eighty.    On the 3d of October, when only  about seventy-eight deaths had taken place, a census taken  showed the entire population, including blacks in both the  upper and lower parts of the city, to be only five hundred and  sixty-eight souls.    Subsequently about one hundred of this  number died ; of whom about fifty died in the month of November.   Several cases and deaths by yellow fever were reported  as late ns the 3d, 4th and 6th of December.  A report made by the board of health during the epidemic  states, that the inhabitants of the country, and in the immediate  vicinity of the city, were ns healthy ns usual at that season.  The meteorological table given by Dr. Perlee shows that  July and August wero very wet, and September very dry.  The rain-gttago gave in July 12-27 inches; in August 8-05  inches; and in September 0-95 inches.    The mean heat of  July was 70 , of August 79°, and of September 75".    Thus  July and August exhibited a lower mean temperature, by 3'  lhan the same months in 1SI8, which was a  healthy year.  The mean heat of September, 1819, was the same nearly as  in 1318.    Hence we sec that the yellow fever in 1810 prevailed under the same temperature, or less, and with more  than double the quantity of ruin which preceded the epidemic  of 1817.—The month of November, in 1819, exhibited a  higher mean temperature than the same time in the preceding  ten years; being (35; Fahrenheit, or three-fourths of a degree  higher than than the mean temperature of November, 1837.  Or  Perlee ascribes this epidemic lo the same  general  causes which, in his opinion, produced that of 1817.    H  supposes the excessive rains in July and August caused a  stronger "predisposition," as during the healthy summer of  1818 it was comparatively dry and healthy.*    As to the particular portion of the city in which it prevailed in 1817 and  1819, we are not informed; but doubtless it occupied that  part of the city in which it has prevailed in each subsequent  epidemic,  The yellow fever had prevailed to a most  . alarming extent  in New Orleans, for about two weeks before it appeared in  Natchez, There had been scattering cases about the shipping, boats and wharves, as early as June; but it did not  become epidemic until about the middle of August. It  raged severely among the shipping, nnd spread to the ndja-  cent streets, as also among the boats which hud descended the  river. Not a ship escaped one or more deaths, and some lost  their whole crews; many steamers became infected, nnd lost  many of their passengers and hands. It did not entirely  cease there until near the last of January, 1820.1  During the years 1820, 1821, and 1822, yellow fever as  nn epidemic, was unknown in Natchez. Yet, in each of  these yeais, especially in 1822, there were several sporadic  cases, and some whose infection was derived from New Orleans, by handling, opening, or sleeping on blankets, &c,  from the infected district of that city. The state of the weather during these summers I have not been able to ascertain.  CORRESPONDENCE.  Natchez, 9th March, 1838.  REV. o. ft.

THE IMPORTANCE OF FEMALE EDUCATION.  Having been invited by the Principal ofthis Institution, to  deliver the first lecture in the course which he has proposed,  I have selected, as my subject, the Importance of Female  Education, which may be regarded as an appropriate introduction to the lectures which arc to follow.  The term education, in its common acceptation, is far  too limited in its meaning. It is commonly used to express  the acquisition of the rudiments of learning', and as applying  to the intellectual faculties only. The etymology of the  word, however, justifies us in extending its application to all  the faculties, morul, intellectual and physical, it signifies to  draw out (e duco) these faculties into vigorous and useful exercise, and expresses that systematic, training to which they  are subjected. The restricted application of the term divorces from it, its most important meaning, namely, a moral  training, which includes religious instruction and discipline.  We call this tho most important patt, because without it, the  j;;  laf-I  ,.l*m  i-f.mil  ,; 0m.  ■m  ifi'l  i    i,  !   -»S  i ' V i  I  I J  ■j r 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/476	476	477.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/477.jp2

And above all,  Such a-trnining renders their eternal salvation more probable;  as il is the instrumentality which God oidinarily employs in  the conversion of the heart.  But the standard of literary acquirements nmong femal-  is fir too low. This is owing chiefly to the influence of a pi  Valent sentiment among the other sex; viz. thai it is both un-  neccssary nnd inexpedient to elevate this stnndaiel above the  ordinary calls of that spline in which tiny nre tie stint d lo  move. This unworthy prejudice has manifested itself in the  bestowment of opprobrious epithets upon such as have  dared to venture on the forbidden ground of a more exalted  and enlarged literature. The phrase "blue-stocking," as  applied to learned females, nrose from a very contracted and  partial estimate of the female mind, and of ils legitimate vocation, if not from vanity and jealousy.  But we trust that this sentiment is passing away with the  ages in which it originated, and with the barbarous heathenism of which it is a remnant. Heathenism gave birth to,  and nurtures that sliong public sentiment which, where ii  prevails, decrees the milder sex to ignorance and servitude.  The light nnd inllu. nee of the gospel, wherever it has  spread, have struck off tin if fillets, and redeemed them from  the bondage in which they were he Id. The Christian re-  ligioil elevates woman to her proper rank, and restores to her  the rights and privileges with which she was endowed by  her Creator. As woman, therefore, should be the last to repudiate or neglect the religion to which she is so much in  debted, so she sho lid be among the first to cherish and cultivate literature, the handmaid and ally of Christianity. As  the one has restored her to liberty and rank, so the other,  by its light nnd power, enables her to maintain them against  future aggressions.  For what is civilization, but the result of education, in tin  expanded sense of that term ? A correct mental and moral  training brings about that state of society, in which the  rights and immunities of women are acknowledged and respected. Wc need not travel to other countries, or look back  too'.her ages, for an exemplification of thistruth. Turn your  eyes upon the aborigines of our own land, nnd mark the  condition of the present generation Behold the servitude  and degradation of ihe female sex, among the tribes that  roam through our forests, and then learn to estimate your indebtedness to religion and literature. How beautiful and appropriate is the brief but comprehensive eulogy which another has pronounced upon the sex: " latest at the cross, and  earliest at the sepulchre."  That females nre not dcfHent in point of intellect is  abundantly evident from the works of those who i. v.,  from time to time, appeared before the public, in the character of authors.     Nor are their works confined to the lightei  the limited number of well educated females, have bundled  with skill and profound research, the more severe end nt.stiusc  points of mental and moral, as Well as natural science.  The term education is also too limited in its meaning, if it  regard merely the acquisition of ideas.     The mental trninino  which it properly incluih s, is far more impoiti.ru for all practical purposes, than the knowledge to be derived from books  merely.    For example, let a female peruse carefully and attentively, a work of close, analogical or analytical reasoning  such as Butler's Analogy, Edwards on the Will, Euclid's  Elements, or Fearne's Essay on Contingent Remainders,and  Executory Devises, (provided she were  familiar with legal  technicalities,) and we venture to affirm that the training arid  discipline which her mind would derive from such u siu.lv,  would be of far more nvail to  her, than all  the ideas she  would acquire from the bonks themselves.    Whin the mind  is thus subjected to a severe discipline, it is expanded and  strengthened ; the life, the vigor, the freshness, wilh which il  operates in the cone.ption, arrangement, and elucidation0/  thought, are vastly more to be desired than that dependent  and torpid reliance upon the thoughts of other men, whicht  mere book reader betrays, however grout may be the rude  and undigested mass of borrowed ideas which he may thus  have obtained.    It is one thing to read,anil it is quite aiiotliei  tiling to study.    We should mingle our own thoughts, as vre  proceed in a work, with those of the writer.    We should  close Ihe hook, even in the middle of a sentence, and follow  out, by meditation or writing, the train of thought which a  word, or phrase, or sentiment of the writer, may have stig.  gested to our own mind.    The mind should be thus habituated to independent and original thinking, and be taught lo  move onward in its own t-tn ngth.    A child must be lailghl  to walk by nn occasional reliance upon ils own ability, so the  mind must frequently be thrown upon ils own resources, and  be left without the extraneous aids and. props on which it  would otherwise rely, and become enervate and subservient  Females commonly discover great timidity in committing  their thoughts to paper, but perhaps they could not accustom themselves to a more profitable exercise. This will  court thought, and lead to method and perspicuity. A correct style, a readiness and felicity of expression are the results of careful practice; and when chastened with that peculiar delicacy with which the female mind tempers its own  conceptions, they become doubly attractive and impressive.  Such we apprehend to bo Ihe legitimate meaning ofthe  term education, when applied to the intellectual faculties; for  the acquisition and multiplication of ideas by no means a-  haust its signification.  To what extent the education of females must necessarily  be carried, in order to answer the ends for which it is 1*  stowed, I do not venture to determine.

Hence, those men who  have distinguished themselves in the literary world, were ei  iher trained up to one of the learned professions, or enjoyed  literary ease and leisure. We speak now of a general rule  there have been, we know, some exceptions. Thoso belonging to the learned professions, have distinguished themselves  in the line of ihcir profession, by bending all the powers of  their minds, nnd causing all their studies and researches to  point to a specific branch of literature, to the comparative  neglect of all the others. The same remark, as far as it is  applicable, is true of those distinguished literary men, who  were attached to no particular profession. Their talents and  acquirements commonly shine in connexion with one only of  the many departments of learning, to the comparative neglect  of the others. Now it is not proposed that females should  prosecute the learned professions, or enjoy literary leisure, to  tlie neglect of their household duties. There are numerous  aad weighty domestic duties, which devolve wholly upon  them, and which they must discharge in a suitable manner.  And it would be as unfair to determine the duties of the one  sex by those of the other, as to argue from the literary excellencies of the one, the deficiencies of the other. For, besides  the field of literature, which is common to both, females are  required to cultivate a branch of knowledge peculiar to their  sex, and which relates to their domestic duties. Now if we  establish a rule of comparison, which will operate to their  disparagement, let that rule work both ways, and by it, infer  from their superior knowledge of household affairs, the intellectual and literary inferiority of the other sex. We shall  then be convinced of the injustice and absurdity of the rule  itself.  It has been made a question whether or not females should  study the dead languages.    But why not ?    Their exclusion  from the practice ofthe learned professions, is surely no valid  reason, else it would apply with equal force to literary men  out of those professions.    If the meaning of (he term education be such as we have defined it, and if the cultivation of  the mind be an essential part of education, then a knowledge  of the dead languages is not the end, but only the means of  education.    And if the end be lawful and proper, how do the  necessary means become less so ?    We four there is a disposition to regard the education of females, in the same light as  that of youth intended for a mechanical trade: and to argue  that the knowledge of the dead languages is no more necessary to a female in the discharge of her household duties,  than it is to mechanics in the performance of their no less  important functions.    If, indeed, a female is to be regarded in  no other light than as a house-keeper or a seamstress, the argu  mentmay have some force : but are they not to be the companions and counsellors of the other sex?    Are they not to  adorn and improve the society of which they are members,  and to give life, and form, and polish to the circle in which  they move?    We might, indeed, turn the argument against  those who use it, and ask, will a knowledge of music, drawing, dancing, &c., increase her ability to regulate her domestic affairs with skill and economy ?    You reply no;   but  music is delightful to tho ear, and painting charms the eye,  and a graceful movement in the ball-room is a conspicuous,  103  as well as a creditable accomplishment. We reply this is all  selfishness You would educate a female only so far as was  necessary to enable her to serve and amuse you. Your own  convenience and gratification constitute the end and object of  her education. This is only polishing nnd jeweling tho  chains, by which you bind her to the task of serving and  pleasing you. Besides, even if you make the convenience  and pleasure of the other sex, the standard of female education, it ought to be remembered that the taste and disposition of  men vary materially; and that what conduces to the pleasure  of one, may be insipid, if not disgusting to another. Therefore,  unless those who have no relish for the refinements of literature are disposed to exclude those who have, from all participation in the pleasures and profits of female society, they  should unite with us in endeavoring to elevate the standard  of female education; which, if it were accomplished, would  greatly enhance the pleasure of female society to well educated and literary men, while, at the same time, it would detract nothing from the profitableness of such sociely to those  of humbler pretensions to learning and intellectual cultivation.  But wo advocate the importance of female education, not  with the view to the convenience and selfish gratification of  our own sex, but on the more exnlted ground of their own  inherent rights and privileges. Wo are at no more liberty  to shackle their minds, than to fetter their bodies. If their  ducation is to be limited in any case, let it be done by providential circumstances, as it is with the opposite sex : and not  by a ruthless proscription, not by an ancient and long cherished prejudice, not by the force of a blind public sentiment.  These nre the chains by which they have been too long held  in cruel subjection, and the age in which we live, the nation  where we dwell, the advancing state of society, and our allegiance to the principles of liberty and free enquiry, all demand, with a loud voice, that they should be delivered from  their bondage, and fully enjoy the gills of providence, and the  privileges of their being, as moral, rational, and accountable  creatures.  We say, then, let the study of the dead languages, and of  every other branch of literature, be regarded as a lawful constituent of female education—let them especially study the  Latin language, even it be merely to perfect a knowledge of  their own.  The want of a proper and adequate education among  females, often exposes them to contempt, and repels from their  society, men of learning nnd science. It is related of Cas-  sori's wife, that she destroyed his whole herbarium, by scraping off his dried specimens, for the sake of the paper. It is  also related of Peiresc's neice, that she used the epistles of his  learned correspondents, in lighting candles.  A female, who, though ignorant, was anxious to be considered intelligent and literary, once asked of a gentleman,  who well understood her character, the loan of the History  of England. He complied with her request, and sent her  also Walker's Dictionary, supposing that she would need the  one in order to understand the other. She, however, read  them both through ; and returned them with her thanks, and  an expression of the pleasure she derived from the perusal of  MjM-  1.1 '.1?

Of two sisters in high life, whose  father had recently gone to Europe, it is related, that on be  inn- asked to what part of Europe their father had gone, one  replied, to France ; the other immediately corrected her, by  saying, that he had gone to Paris, and not to France. Many  instances of a similar kind might be stated, showing the  mortifying effects of a defective female education. What  cheek eloes not mantle with shame at the bare recital of such  humiliating exposures of female ignorance ! What parent,  of delicate sensibilities, would not be overwhelmed with con  fusion, if a daughter should so dishonor her sex! What  brother, of proper feelings, could endure the mortification, if  a sister should so offend the ears of a refined and intelligent  company ? The experience of such mortification would pro  bably be so potent anargument, as to dispel from the mind of  him who suffered it, the last, lingering doubt, as to the importance of female education ; and would secure us an effectual ally in the cause we advocate. (  The cultivation of the female mind, greatly increases the  influence of the female character in society. To this influence we owe all the delicate refinements, and chastened sympathies of social life. Whenever the female sex is degraded,  nnd their influence destroyed, the male sex becomes so in n  corresponding proportion.    Cast your eye over the various  being within themselves, they would no longer be dependent  for enjoyment, upon persons or circumstances. Unless jur.  rounded by external sources of pleasure, uneducated females  are apt to experience great uneasiness and misery. They arc  sensible of a vacancy which they cannot fill up, except with  sighs and fruitless complaints. For there are times to such  when even novels satiate and cloy the appetite, and when  music has lost its charms. Indeed, even gaiety and fashion  themselves, will at times lose their power lo captivate and  please. An " empty void," called the ennui, is experienced  and the sufferer can find no adequate relief, not even in the  sympathies of kindred spirits.  Even the external sources of enjoyment on which uneducated females are so dependent, are not always adequate to  the gratification of their desires, neither are they of such a  character as to improve the mind or mend the heart. The  scandal of the female sex has been the theme of dramatist!  anil poets, held up to ridicule by the satirist, and severely  reproved by the moralist. But who nre they that, for the  most part, are given to this vice ? Are they not those whose  mental cultivation is inadequate to a higher and moie commendable grade of conversation ? Elevate the standard of  female education; kindle within their bosoms a zeal for knowledge and literary pursuits; let them taste the cup of intellectual enjoyment, and you do more to reform the cryino- vices  of the sex, than all the lessons of the moralist, or the cen  communities, and nations of the earth, for a confirmation of sures of the satirist, have hitherto effected,  this statement.    What is the state of society where to be a|    Old age, the haggard ghost that haunts the gay, the vain,  the giddy girl of uncultivated intellect,  is honored, admired  woman, is to be a slave, bound to the ignoble task of minis  tering to the gratification of proud, domineering man 1 Such  is the nature of the social system, that where it is legitimately acted out, the gentle and imperceptible influence of the  one sex, is found to soften down the asperities, and rectify the  natural uncouthness of the other. Her smile relaxes his  rigid countenance, and expands his knitted brows. The music  of her voice subdues his vociferous tones. And the mildness of her demeanor, tames the wild restlessness of his nature. Such is the legitimate influence of the female character in society. And in order to sustain this influence, and  make it effectual, it must be guided and controlled by a cultivated intellect. Knowledge is power; and although it is  true, that woman really governs, while she seems to obey,  yet her authority is in proportion to her intelligence and refinement.  The influence of female education is felt in elevating the  standard of mental cultivation in the opposite sex. It appeals  effectually to the pride of men, even when it fails to awaken  a more commendable motive. If they would appear to advantage in the society of intelligent and well educated ladies,  they feel that they must increase their own knowledge, and  cultivate their own minds. Vanity is a powerful stimulant  in any cause. And the one sex are perhaps not more free  from its influence than the other, although it may operate  in a different manner upon each.  Such an education as we are contending for, would afford  to females abundant employment and amusement for nil their  and revered, when adorned with knowledge and education.  Old age, the dread of youthful vanity and ignorance, the  bane of pleasures that live upon flattery and beauty; old  age, when able to instruct with wisdom, has thrown around  it, a charm and an attraction which more than compensate  for the loss of youth and beauty. For what is beauty? Il  is a fading flower thnt blooms upon tho cheek of youth. It  is a fruitless blossom, that withers at ihe touch of time, and  often instills poison in the bosom which it decks. What are  the pleasures of beauty ? They are the fragrance of the  flower, which it sends forth only while it lives. But what  is a good education ? It is a fountain of pleasure, sending  forth its perennial streams to irrigate and beautify sociely. It  is a jewel which is polished, not obscured, by the hand of  time. Youth must grow old, beauty will fade, flattery will  :ease, or become insipid, even riches may take to themselves  wings and fly away, but a good education remains, and improves by that which destroys more ephemeral attractions.  In this connection it may be observed, that education may  be called upon, in the providence of God, to subserve a more  important and substantial purpose, than mere gratification or  pleasure. We have just said that riches may take to themselves wings and disappear. This reverse is often realized.  Those who, in the midst of affluence, have studied accomplishments, merely with the view of becoming more attractive, and of ministering pleasure to the circle in which they  moved, have, in tho reverses of fortune, been compelled to  leisure hours.    Tiny would have access to sources of plea-j resort to those accomplishments for the means of subsistence,  snre from which others are debarred.

Let no female suppose herself ex  •mnt from the sinile3 or frowns of providence. God's ways  are often inscrutable and past finding out; and as it is the  part of wisdom to prepare for events that may befall us, and  that have befallen others. Let this consideration have its  due weight in estimating tho importance of female educa  tion.  In its bearing upon the future maternal character of the  present and coming generations of the sex, our subject as  sumes an importance beyond all that individual gratification  or atlvnntago can bestow upon it. Who are to instil the  earliest principles into those minds that are hereafter to pre  side over the destiny of human society ? To whose mould  ing bond will be committed the character of the next and  succeeding generations ? To the sex, whose cause wc advocate to-day. And if such be their task, what should be their  qualifications? What an amount of mental nnd moral training is necessary to prepare them for tho duties that devolve  upoa them! If unable to instruct their offspring, if unable  properly to cultivate and cherish the buddings of the infant  mind, if unable to guide its enquiries and rectify its mistakes, we need not the gift of prophecy to predict the future  character and destiny of those who are thus committed to  blind guides and incompetent instructors.  The duties which mothers owe. to their children, cannot,  during their earliest infancy, be transferred to other hands.  The attempt would be frustrated by the very texture ofthe  social system.    These duties are inherent in the connexion  itself, and can not be separated from it.    Hence, impressions  will be made by the mother, upon the mind of her infant  she will give a direction and cast  to its future character,  She cannot avoid it, if she would.    And she should remom  ber that her responsibility is in proportion lo her influence  It i3 a question of vast importance to the community nnd  to the nation of which those children are to constitute a  part, whether these impressions are to be salutary or ban.  Ail.   If then, you desire to become the benefaclors of vol  race, and ihat your influence and exertions, should outlive  the period of your allotted time on earth, and tell, with happy effect, upon the character of generations yet unborn, use  that influence, and put forth those exertions, in elevating the  standard of female education  The character and genius of our civil institutions imparts  to this subject additional importance  The mothers of our future law-givers and rulers, will lay  the foundation of that character which will belong to them.  The infant statesmen of coming years, will imbibe their most  enduring principles from the lips of those who shall give  them birth. Let it not be supposed that we unduly estimate  the maternal influence. Some of the greatest and best men  that have ever lived, havo acknowledged their indebtedness  to this influence, for all that distinguished them in life, nnd  made them the ornaments of tho age and nation in which  they lived. Viewed in this light our subject becomes fraught  with the destiny of this great Republic. It is the highest  praise that can be bestowed upon our form of government,  that it cannot flourish, nor be successfully administered, where  the mass of the people are vicious, ignorant and debased. Nor  is the amount of virtue and knowledge which it requires of  imperfect and sinful beings, so great as to render it impracti  cable or Utopian. It steers a safe and happy medium between  Sylla and Charybdis. Its tendency is to elevate the standard  of good morals and intelligence, by opening the door of promotion and distinction to all, and making the hope of success  an incentive to the cultivation and practice of virtue. Such  being the distinctive features of our civil policy, the importance of female education rises in magnitude, as we contemplate its bearing upon the safety and prosperity ofthe nation.  The general diffusion of religious knowledge through the  medium of Sunday schools and bible classes, affords an additional argument in support of our main proposition. Using  the term education in its extended and legitimate sense, wo  contend that its standard among females should be elevated,  if they would keep pace with the religious intelligence of  those who nre favored with Sabbath school instruction, and  whose parents do not regard such an institution as beneath  their notice and patronage.  The mothers and elder sisters of the present day are not  unfrcquently put to shame, by the superior knowledge of religious matters, which the younger branches of the family  have acquired in these nurseries of piety and usefulness. The  system of bible-class instruction, also, gives to those who  avail themselves of it, so decided an advantage in conversation or writing, that it cannot escape the notice even of a superficial observer. These facilities to youth have compelled  others to study and read the bible, and the history of the  times and nations of which it treats, in order to maintain a  respectable appearance of intelligence, and to avoid a mortifying exposure of their ignorance by little children. And if  females would insure respect, and maintain their proper influence in society, they must bestow upon this branch of education, a much larger share of attention than is common  among certain classes. Literature has ever been the handmaid and companion of religion. And tho literature of religion is becoming better understood, and more generally  studied, than perhaps at any former period. Our colleges,  being for the most part, under the direction and influence of  religious teachers, will continue to impart more or less ofthis  species of literature to the minds of the rising generation,  and thus, by its influence on the social system, compel tho  female sex to give it more attention, else their ignorance and  deficiency will be glaringly exposed, by the light which is  reflected by the other sex.  In conclusion, permit me to call your attention to two evils  in regard to female education, which are said to be prevalent  in this district of country. The first relates to the practice  of passing by the schools and seminaries at home, and sending your daughters to those at a distance. Without saying  any thing derogatory to tho character and standing of tho  female schools at the north and cast, I may be permitted to  remark, that distance often throws around objects, unreal  harms, and therefore becomes a deceptive medium through  which to view the qualities either of persons or things." .The  halo of excellence by which they seem to be encircled, exists  only in the medium through which they are viewed.

The declaration of our Lord and Saviour, that a prophet  hath honor save in his own country, embodies a principle as  upplicable to the subject before us as to any other. The prac  tice of which we speak, makes this state tributary in litera  lure to the north. It is an acknowledgment of our inferior!  ty in tho facilities of education, which is doubtless true; but  it need not be true. This practice helps to make it true. It  enervates the sinews of literary enterprise at home. It undervalues our actual resources, and discourages all effort to  develope them. There is no good reason why this state and  this city should not possess adequate facilities for education  in all its branches. The wealth, intelligence, refinement and  enterprize of this community, seem lo demand ihat the effort should be made, and seem, to promise that the effort  shall be successful. Let the State of Mississippi consult her  true interest and honor, and she will no longer make it necessary to bow down and do homage to the superior facilities of other stales. Her patriotism, her enterprize, and her  political influence command the respect of other sections of  the country, and shall her literature, the bulwark of our political strength and respectability, be suffered to languish or  pine away in insignificance? On the contrary, let the standard of education be lifted high. Let her resources be made  available, and let her facilities be multiplied, till she shall at  tract to her own bosom the youth of other states, that sin  may train them up for usefulness, and send them back as  blessings to the society from which they came.  The remaining evil to which I will allude, relates to the  practice of frequently changing the teachers of your children. If the claims of every new establishment should induce parents to make this change, it will operate most unfavorably upon the progress of the pupils. When a teacher  becomes acquainted with the mental habits and abilities of his  pupil, and when the pupil becomes familiar with the teacher's  mode of instruction, the principal difficulties in the way of  success arc removed, and the progress of ihe pupil is increased in a very perceptible ratio. Besides, these frequent  changes operate to the discouragement of those teachers from  whom the pupils are taken, and tends ultimately to break up  the institution. Permanency in a seminary of learning, is an  invaluable characteristic. It strengthens confidence, increases  zeal, and affords an opportunity of completing what has  been commenced. But this practice, of which we speak,  must always give to our institutions an ephemeral character, and render abortive what might otherwise be successful.  It is to bo hoped that the day is not far distant, when this  city shall bo ns famed for its facilities in the education of females, as it is for its refinement and hospitality: and when we  shall no longer send our daughters to other states, as witnesses and messengers, to publish our destitution and barrenness.  Let the commendable pride of Mississippi be touched, let her  honor be appealed to, and her gallantry will be as distinguished for educating the fair sex, as it now is for honoring  and admiring them.

It is the intention of the Executive Committee of the South.  Western Journal, to give rather more variety to the stucceedimr  numbers, bydevoting nearly one-half the space to shorter editorial and selected articles. The design is not to give a lighter  character to the publication, but a more practical and varied  one. The limits of the Journal will not permit essays of  great length, or those continued through successive numbers,  without the danger of substituting a monotonous sameness for  the lively and pleasing variety, which the public taste justly  requires in the periodical literature of our country. The  same care will be taken in the preparation of the shorter articles as in the longer. A few brief papers will be presented  on rural economy, embracing the best modes of cultivating  ornamental shade trees and shrubbery,  We have a gentle hint for our poetic correspondents—  which, (ns mediocrity in poetry is abhorrent both to the godsam!  to men.) we venture to press at this time. More credit would  accrue to most writers of poetry for periodicals, if they would  select every tenth line they write for publication (a premium  tithe)and burn the remainder: that is to say, the subtraction  of nine parts from ten makes the tenth ten limes as valuable  as the whole would have been : thus 10—9«a» 10 X 10= good  poetry I  THE TEACHERS' CONVENTION.  A county convention of Teachers and friends of Education was organized in this city, on Saturday, the 17th instant,  aswill be seen by the official report, publishi I in the present  number of the Journal. Fifteen members s ^.icd the constitution, and paid their initiation fee. This, we believe, will  bo a working society. There seemed to be a strong disposition evinced by some of the members to institute a censorship  of the character and qualifications of teachers, through which  they must successfully pass, before they could be admitted to  the confidence of the public.

At a meeting of the teachers of Adams county, and the  friends of education in general, convened, pursuant to notice,  on Saturday, tho 17th of March, nt the City Hall, in the city  of Natchez, Professor C. G. FoRSHEV was called to the  chair, and S. H. B. Black was appointed secretary.  The chairman stated the object of the meeting to be the  formation of an Association for the county of Adams, auxiliary to the Education Association of the State of Mississippi.  The benefits to be derived from such an organization were  ably discussed and commented upon. Professor Van Hoesen  offered the following resolution, which, after being amended,  was adopted.  Resolved, That we, the teachers and friends of education  in Adams county, unite our efforts for the advancement of education, and for elevating the character of the professional  leacher,and for the frequent discussion of all the principles  and practices embraced in the profession of instruction.  On motion of Mr. 1. C. Patridge, it was resolved, that the  chair appoint a committee of two poisons to report a constitu  tion for the Association. Whereupon the chair appointed  Mr. Patridge and Professor Van Hoesen. On motion, the  chair was added to the committee.  The committee, haying withdrawn for the purpose, returned and reported the following preamble and constitution,  which, after being read, and the several provisions separately  and closely examined, were unanimously adopted.  CONSTITUTION.  We, the teachers of Adams county, and the friends of education in convention assembled, deeply impressed with the  importance of organizing their profession in the valley of  the Mississippi, by a permanent association, in order to promote the sacred interests of education, by collecting its members, advancing their mutual improvement, nnd elevating the  profession lo its great intellectual and moral influence in com.  munity, do hereby resolve ourselves into an association, to be  governed by the following constitution.  ARTICLE   I.  Section 1. This Association shall he known by the name  of the "Adams County Education Association," auxiliary to  the State Association of professional instructors.  Sec. 2.

One of the richest and purest specimens of thought and  feeling we have recently seen, is the address of Bin Excel-  ency, Edward Everett, Governor of Massachusetts, de-  ivercd before the Charitable Mechanic Association, last  September. There are noble sentiments in this address, that  should sink eleep into the heart of every American Mechanic,  and shape his life to the sublime destinations of his calling.  We give two brief extracts:—"Let us but advert for a moment to the mariner's compass, the telescope, the quadrant.  For myself, I never reflect upon their influence on the affairs of man, and remember that they are, after all, merely  mechanical contrivances, without emotions of admiration  bordering upon awe. This sentiment, I know, is so worn  away by habit, that it seems almost to run into sentimentality.  But let us not be ashamed to reproduce tho emotions that  spring from the freshness of truth and nature. What must  not have been Galileo's feelings, when he pointed the first  telescope to the heavens, and discovered the phases of Venus  and the moons of Jupiter!

"  METEOROLOGIC ITEMS.  Read belbro the Lyceum, March 10, 183S.  In presenting to the Lyceum an abstract of the Meteoro  logic Register for February, 1 deem it proper to give also a  salmagundi of meteorologic trash—a spice of several topics  and not much of either.  And first—the severity ofthe past month, with a mean temperature 11° lower than that of January, suggested to me to  make some inquiry in regard to cold winters in this region  The results of this inquiry, have furnished some facts of in  terest, although the information is less specific than could be  wished.    The winter of 177!)—80, we know from various  records, and particularly from the details of suffering- in revo.  lutionary history, was one of the coldest in the memory of  man.    An aged and  respectable lady, still  resident  in this  village, relates that in that winter, her father and family landed at Natchez; and that such  was the cold, that the ice projecting from the banks of the Mississippi, rendered it impossible for the boats to land; but that slabs were extended from  the boats to the ice, upon which they landed.    No parallel  to this has been witnessed since, if we may credit the memory of one who has resided in Natchez since 1782.    ■ In the  same winter,' says a venerable member of this Lyceum, ' I  was told by Gen, Mackall of Georgia, that the Savannah,  about latitude 32" north, was completely frozen over.'    The  American Almanac of last year contains many interesting  facts in regard to this winter, but all in regard to a more  northern latitude.    These remarks are here made to show  how widely extended were its effects.    I have been told by  the aged  Christopher Miller, of Natchez, that one winter  since that time, but for the date he could only say it was many  years since, the ice in the Mississippi floated past Natchez in  such vast quantities, as, in his opinion, to render it impossible  for one to cross in safety.    No one however attempted it to  his knowledge.    From a register of February, 1823, furnished me by the member above alluded to, I find tho thermometer at 3 P. M. ofthe 13th, up to 74"—nearly summer heat-  and on the morning of the loth, down to 5j°, showing a fall  of 08i" in thirty-nine hours.    On the morning of tho lGth,  the temperature was +4 °, which is the lowest mark I can  find on record for this latitude.    President Dubuisson says  that he has, on one occasion, seen it —2J, which is much  lower  than  any thing furnished  by  the  tables of mam-  years.  The number of meteors for the past month has been ver»  small, and their size remarkably diminutive.  The greater part of the month has been very unfavorable  for celestial observations ; yet we have been gratified wilh  several exhibitions of our evening halos of more than ordinary splendor.    In the January number of Silliman's Jour  nal of Science, there is an article from the pen of Willis  Gaylord, which attempts to account for these halos.   Hoiv  far he has succeeded, I propose here briefly to examine. The  writer assumes that " in no part of the United States is thi,  rich garniture ofthe heavens displayed in so striking a man-  ner as in the valley of the great  lakes and the country iin.  mediately south-east of them;" and then proceeds to give hij  reasons for this fact.     These are arranged to show, in a few  words, that the reflections of the sunshine from alternate surfaces—allowing perspective its legitimate effect—produce the  "crowns of glory" which occasionally rest upon the retiring  "king of day."    For instance, if Lake Huron lie between  the observer and sunset, but sufficiently far west of him, lo  receive the direct rays of the sun, when he has set to the observer, the reflection of these rays might rise to a visible region of the atmosphere, and there appear a " crimson sunset"  But if mountains and hills lie between the observer and Lake  Huron, these might, in places, interrupt tho reflected light  and thereby divide the colored atmosphere into thopencilsoi  brushes, we so often witness just aftei sunset.  Having had occasion to compare the evening splendors of  those regions, with these of our own, by residence in both  I can cheerfully testify that the latter are vastly the more varied and beautiful. Here the halos referred to by Mr. Gay-  lord, are not, as these, confined to the summer half of the  year, but are frequent at all seasons. Now, if we admit thai  the reflections from lake, hill, and dale cause these halosin  the " valley of the lakes," I fear we shall have lo seek for  another cause to produce the same eflect, in our own region.  The vast forest and prairie region, lying west and south-wesl  from us, presents neither water, hill, nor mountain, nor any  other objects, which, as I conceive, could cause the variety  in the magnificent displays in question. And even werelhii  obstacle removed, I see not how the theory of Mr. G. is to  account for the fact, that, very often, two successive evening!  present gorgeous sunsets, the one broken into pencils anJ  the other entirely unbroken ! Every fair evening should  bring with it a halo.  " Mountains sink not down,  Nor do the vallies rise."  The truth is, the cause assigned, though ingenious and answering to the geography of the  writer's region, will apply  to few others; for these halos appear, so far as I can ascertain, in all parts of the United States.  I have been in the habit of attributing the great superio"'  ty of our sunsets in their deep and varied colors, to the ex-  treme humidity of our southern atmosphere ; every partic"  of watery vapor reflecting and refracting the rays of the sun.  after sunset, but while the visible atmosphere west still receives his direct light.    Now, though this view of the sot  fu  Si,  us&gt;  fid  pre  IU.S  esti  Ly,  the  setti  A  ings  by t. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/483	483	484.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/484.jp2

SOUTH-WESTERN J 0 U R N AL  111  iect was not the result of much investigation, yet the fact that  these colors are palest in the dryest weather, and deepest while  the barometer is sinking and the nir growing more humid,  seems to corroborate the position. And this view would account at once for " the dim transparent haze diffused through  the air," mentioned by Mr. Gaylord, as it would also for the  derp colors of sunset during the burning of the prairies. As  in the cause ofthe beautiful pencillingsof the "amber west,"  which I have been calling zodiacal hnlos, (perhaps very erroneously,) I have not formed even a conjecture. It probably docs riot exist in the earth, nor even in its atmosphere, as  die brushes arc not visible except when the atmosphere is  comparatively pure. I have never witnessed them in a very  humid or smoky atmosphere.  A lie-lit of another character remains to be noticed. On  the night of the 19th, immediately after twilight, I perceived  llie dim outline of a pyramid of nebulous light, with the mid  die of its vertex in the constellation Taurus. Its base was  about 12" wide, and its axis, as nearly as I can determine it  from repeated observation, 1" north of and parallel to, the  ecliptic. From these facts, it will be perceived, it lies wholly  within the zodiac, and hence I conclude it to be the zodiacal  light. Its nebulosity resembles that ofthe milky way, but is  sometimes a little brighter. It has appeared every fair even  ing since the 19th until the presence of the moon has pre  vented ils examination; it revolves with the heavens and disappears between 8 and 9, P. M. I should not hesitate to  pronounce it zodiacal light, but for the fact that its axis lies  north of the ecliptic, instead of exactly in il at its base, or  with such a direction as to pass through the sun's centre; and  because this axis lies parallel to, instead of making a small  angle with the ecliptic.  The appearance of this phenomenon suggested to me to  observe the needle, us I, at first, suspected the light to be au-  roral; and 1 was surprised to find the fluctuations so great  Hut having satisfied myself that the light was not auroral,  these magnetic movements were left entirely unexplained  Since that time I have kept a register of the movements of  the needle. Having revolved the face of a fine compass to  the variation for the particular instrument, (8" 12' east,) I  placed it entirely out of the influence of any local attraction,  evelled it, and set it carefully with the needle at zero, at 4  M,    In the morning at 9, of the following day, it was  I  stationary at 10' east, at 2 P. M. it hud reached zero again,  where it remained till after 5 P. M., but at 11 P. M. it was  fully 15' west I making 25' of variation in twelve hours.  Since that time it has rarely been west of zero, but has been,  usually, 10' east at 9 in the morning. Observations of sufficient number, and length of time, have not yet been made to  pronounce the diurnal variation so. great, though I strongly  suspect the fact. 1 promise to keep a register of this interesting matter, and commur.ic.ate it from time to time to the  Lyceum. How many conflicting lines and land claims would  the determination of such a diurnal variation, explain and  settle I  Again: the past month has furnished us with several evenings, in which the "warm currents" abounded. And lest  by the insertion in the Lyceum Journal of the views of a  writer for the Knickerbocker, it should seem thnt those views  met (lie sanction of the Lyceum, I would record my dissent to  Ihem nearly in toto.    Since the questions in regard to warm  currents were propounded to our body, by an honorary member, some time last summer, I have had the subject under frequent consideration, carefully noting the circumstances under  which they occur, but have discovered nothing which would  occasion mo now to trouble you, but for the above reasons.  These currents are not " very rapid in their passage, nor transient in their stay," for I have frequently returned, after passing them, to examine them at leisure.    Nor are they more  frequent early, than late in the evening: for my own observations have shown them more frequent between 9 nnd 12 P.  M.    What the writer means by " the aggregating nature of  caloric," I cannot understand, having been early taught to believe that caloric tended to equilibrium.   If these currents be  nothing more than the streaks of air, (warmed by the sun when  too low to heat all equally,) set in motion, how shall we account for their appearance in a brisk breeze, and at so late an  hour as 12 o'clock ?    No known properties of caloric can account for its failure to diffuse itself immediately, if the atmosphere which receives it be pure, and similar to that which  surrounds it.    Hence I conclude ihat its character is gaseous,  and that it is generated very near where it is found by the  passer-by.    That it is entirely different from common pure  atmosphere, I have satisfied myself, by finding a current, and  remaining in it for several breaths.    It is sensible to the olfac-  torie-s, and very oppressive to breathe.   From ihe smothering  sensation it produces, (resembling that one feels on breathing  a short time under bed clothes,) I have little doubt that il is a  nitrous gas, how produced I cannot conceive.    In ploughing,  in the summer and autumn, I have frequently opened seams  of air confined in the heated ground, and breathed the very  same species of air.    And not imfreqiienlly a slight degree of  the same scent is perceptible in tho south wind.    (By the  way, why is no wind, but a south one, sensible to the olfactories?)    Nor does an examination of my register sustain tho  position that they indicate approaching rain, or thunder and  lightning.    For in only one instance have I rain recorded  within three days of such note; at other times, six and even  eight days have elapsed without rain, or lightning in any direction, and these facts, with me, entirely discredit their electric character.    If it did not seem like "sporting with the  lightnings," I should be disposed to ridicule the idea of "hot  and cold currents corresponding to positive and negative  electricity. "  But much as February has presented of interest, you are  doubtless reatly to wish its manes n long quiet, unless the future may furnish it a more amusing biographer. But be not  ]iasty—its anecdotes are not all told. We have had rain,  sleet, and snow, hail, thunder and mud —lunar bows and solar  bows—and numerous other beaux, scarcely noticeable under  the head of meteorology : and I shall at least have the vote of  the ladies, that that month is most interesting which brings  with it tho greatest number of beaux.

Read beforo Ilis Jelforton Collsj  Profe  Lyceum, at Natchoz, September 2d, 1837, by  Igor 0. (I. 1'llICSIIKY.  National independence and stability derive their existence  from ihe possession and cjccrcise of iho means of self-defence.  Republics, like monarchies, are ever liable to foreign insult  and civil commotion j and therefore should cultivate the maxim, "In the midst of peace, bo prepared for war." Experience,  ihnt venerable instructor, gray with service, has taught our  country, that the exercise of every pacific duly, and the observance of every law in the national code, are no safeguard  to our citizens or our commerce; but an appeal to arms-lias  st il J been necessary to demonstrate, thrt the dove of peace  can transform herself into the eagle of hostility. And as the  man whose principles arc above the brutality of duelling or  bailie, is bound to protect his person and family from ihe  abuse of the unprincipled,—so the nation, whose motlo is  peace, is bound for the security of her property and citizens.  With this view of the importance of the subject, wc sh  offer no apology for devoting a few pages lo the consideration  of Military Education.  1st. AVe shall consider the nature and objects of Military  Education.  Ally. How far thoso objects arc effected in Europe and  the United States.  odly. The effect it has upon individual mind and natural  character.  ■lib, and lastly. How far military discipline might be beneficially introduced into civil institutions of learning.  First, then—the nature and objects. Proficiency in any  mechanical vocation presupposes an apprenticeship or course  of training, and reputabilily in any of the learned professions,  a thorough course of professional study. The profession of  arms, is tho union of mechanical and intellectual culture: tho  former nearly equivalent to a mechanical trade, and tho latter  wholly equal to cither of the learned professions. It will  therefore be granted, that thoso who destine themselves for the  army, in the capacity of commander, should serve in the one,  and be thoroughly instructed in the other.  In the mechanical department, every commissioned officer  of course, should be familiar with tho manual and detail of  "'cry duty which even casualty might render essential to  forces in actual service. Accordingly, when a cadet enters a  military academy, ho commences with performing the simpler commands in tactics. For a few months, he is exclusively occupied, singly and in the ranks, in learning to perform, when commanded, the elementary duties of drill. This  is followed by the more complicated manoeuvres, devoting  about a fifth of each of his four or five years exclusively to  exercise in drill, and the manual of heavy and light infantry  and artillery. Besides, a portion of every day, otherwise  devoted to study, is similarly spent, until each in his order,  and at due advancement, has pel formed the functions of every  grade, from tho ranks to the commandancy of a battalion,  The theory of manoeuvres, like every thing in a military  (or any rational,) education, is, with geometric precision, derived from the practice, nor is it till after the cadet has mastered nearly all the evolutions from actual experience, that a  volume of taclics is placed in his hands. In the mechanical  department of artillery exercise, a vast deal is learned; such  as the manoeuvres of field artillery with cannon, gun-carriages,  caissons, and all their implements; the exercise of siege artillery, with mortar and howitzer; target practice, with gun,  howitzer, and mortar, with the thousand duties of the laboratory, in making powder, rockets, shells, portfire, and fuzes.  In this catalogue of mechanical duties, we do not include  masonry, carpentry, architecture nnd civil and military engineering, as they arc taught in tho United States from diagram  and theory, though in France from practice. 13ut an estimate  made from a knowledge of tho rigid economy of moments  practised in military schools, it would be found, that the time  devoted to military exorcise, falls little short of the usual apprenticeship.  The intellectual duties of this profession, particularly in  the mathematics and exact sciences, are so arduous, extensive  and thorough, and llieir performance enforced wilh such unchanging rigor, that tho whole term of cadetship not occupied  ns already noticed, is barely sufficient. Every possible stimulant to enterprise and excellence, which the honors ofthe  classes can furnish, nnd every inducement which the fear of  degradation or dishonor can offer, contribute lo render ihe intellectual, as well as the mechanical acquisitions of military  ducalion, accurate and profound. And tho judicious alternation of exercise—bold, vigorous, manly exercise, is admirably calculated to give energy and efficiency to intellectual  exertion; whilst, reciprocally, the sedentary habits of cloister  duty, the writhing of the menial powors in knotty investigation, and their importunate call for quarter, add a relish and  avidity to physical action. These habits, and these only, can  account (and al best with difficulty,) for the catalogue of volumes and subjects cadets masler in the brief term of a usual  collegiate course. And a comparison of the volumes, the  quantity and quality of their contents, would sustain the position, that the graduated officers of the French or United  States army, rank higher in menial acquisition than tlie ordinary graduate of either of the learned professions.  Having said thus much of the nature, we proceed to show  the objects of a military education. These are manifold and  of vital value to an army, and the country it is educated to  fend. The brief space allotted to this lecture, will permit  the notice of but a few of the more obvious. And taking  the first that occurs,—a soldier must learn obedience, implicit  and immediate. Without implicit obedience in each officer  to his superior in rank, all that promplness so essential in  i.TS  -   -in  ;. ■ 'tC( it  '^M  ■ ■ iw tl  i. i"t.i  1Kb  u  ■m  r 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/487	487	488.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/488.jp2

Here, there is no time  for discussing the wisdom or expediency of a command,—no  time for wordy contests between the " letter" nnd " spirit" of  the law, which regulates relative duties, lest the moment for  executing be lost, in dispute about the manner. Orders must  be instantly obeyed, and during the leisure which may succeed, discuss their propriety: for each officer is amenable  to a tribunal of his fellow-soldiers for every movement. That  a course of training is necessary to implicit obedience, every  one knows who has examined his own repugnance to being  ordered. Many of our Southern youth find it accord very  ill with their preconceived notions of liberty and courtesy,  to do nothing as they choose, and be commanded, in an imperious manner, in the military academy. And we have often  heard the Southern "Pleib," (as the entering cadet is called,)  lo say, on return from a drill in which he has figured most  clumsily, thai "he would have performed ten times better, if  be had been asked or invited in a gentlemanly maimer/' Yet,  by continued habit, cadets are so accustomed to orders on  duty, that to substitute courteous invitation, would appear as  insincere and ridiculous, ns orders bad originally seemed imperious and insulting.—A second and equally important object, is, to instil habits of promptitude and punctuality,—the  lining of every thing precisely at the lime and in the manner  prescribed, without special command. And the regular recurrence of duties in military schools, without the possibility  of evasion, is strangely efficient in eliciting-such hnbits. And  so deeply are they incorporated into die character, thnt they  insensibly ramify into all the business of civil, as well as of  military life. Again: warfare always exposes more or less  to privation and hardship, which, without iniatory training,  could be borne but at the expense of health and efficiency,  nnd oftentimes of life. To subsist upon the coarsest, least,  and most indifferent provisions, and at the same time perform  the most arduous duties; to breast the severity of winter's  cold and summer's heat, to be exposed to loss of sleep, drenching rain, or parching thirst, and yet to peisevere with assiduity and even avidity, in the discharge of duty—because his  country, his own beloved country, demands it—these are a  few of the hardships to which the soldier's life is exposed.  The illustrious Washington, (with becoming reverence be  that name pronounced,) experienced them all in their most  afflicting form; and saw many of the noblest patriot hearts  sink beneath the struggle, (or lack of early training to exposure; and it was then that he formed those resolutions and  principles, upon which was founded, at a later day, the United  States' Military Academy.  Yet every capability of physical endurance were attained  to no purpose, if (be principles of the possessor be radically  wrong. He must be enlisted, heart as well as band, in the  service of his country—he must be actuated by loftier views  and nobler patriotism than pecuniary gain can inspire: and  he must feel his bosom thrill with the pride and daring of a  genuine soldier, at every call of his country for his services.  To excite these emotions, and establish these principles, foun  another object of military education; and this is effected by  models of greatness nnd devotion to country, taken from the  history of all nations, but chiefly of his own.    Who thnt  ever knew a soldier's pride, can read the biography of a j&gt;,„  nam, or a (&gt;rci n, a Washington, or a Bolivar, a Cincinnati,,  or Leonidas, without one emotion, or wish to resemble Infm  By observing and celebrating national festivals, to the m(.|r.0  ry of glorious deeds; and with song, and jubilee, and m,ir.  tial pomp, commemorating the virtues of (he immortal dead.  by wnving the banners under which patriots have fought for  bleeding liberty, and marching to airs that freshen the memory of triumph in battle,—by these the flame of patriotism il  enkindled in the youthful soldier's bosom,—a flame which  bums till the lamp of life flickers out.  In connection with the objects of military institutions, i»  shall insist upon the utility of these objects; a task whtcli  were superfluous, but for the strange hostility, recently gotten  up, in quarters whence more enlightened views might \1Cf%  pected.  All who rend the correspondence of Washington, (aneleb  I not give offence by supposing there are any present who do  not?) will remember bow often he repeats and lament} the  difficulty ol obtaining military engineers. He writes lorn,  ry quaiter, offering almost any compensation, and ordering  those who have the acquirements, wherever found in llionr-  my, to be released from every other duly, lo supply the impe,-  ative demands of the service. How often does he atlrilinie  disaster to want of fortifications, the means of scientific attack, ignorant artillerists, and undisciplined, though brave.  commanders? Anil it was at a time when our country ira  being blessed wilh the first fruils of dear-bought liberty, and  enjoyed the fairest prospect of permanent peace, ihat he insisted  upon the establishment of a school for the education of ofi  eers. His advice was always prudent—the result of reflection j—in this case experience had made him wise.  The profession of military engineering is one which fen  will learn for the chances of employment, when his country  may go to war: and civil engineers, if even these were pin-  ty. are, in most cases, inefficient substitutes. For scientific  artillerists there is no substitute: for few citizens are ledbr  bare curiosity to analyze the parabolic curve described byl  shell, or the exact mathematical force required to throw  ball of known dimensions loa given distance. In thedepai  ment of military surveying and drafting, we should never,  perhaps, find an expert hand that had not been trained on purpose. The ordinary drawer of pretty landscapes wonU  serve but to mislead and confuse. It is to one trained to the  observation of those minute and evanescent irregulaiiwi  which are usually deemed plain, and to such only, that a  be entrusted the correct representation of grounds; and toll*  performance of such a task, a much more thorough IfflC*  ledge of the principles of his art, are essential, than is voluntarily learned.

It thus becomes important, that all military effictr;  should be well taught in the science of perspective, and IB  drawing dependent upon it.

If then it be granted that each nation should keep forces  always prepared for its protection; (and who dare deny this?)  and if it be impossible, as we have shown, to obtain competent officers for the various duties and departments of warfare,  the necessity of military schools for their education will  follow.  * # ♦ « a »  • 2dly. We havo promised to show how far the objects of  military education are effected in several European countries,  and compare them with our own. In this department, the  extreme dearth of facts on record, will render my lecture still  more barren of interest. The subject of militaiy education  seems never to have engaged the pen of an able writer; and  \ if we except a lew general views in Edgcworlh's " Profession.  al Education," and an eccentric and paradoxical article in the  Edinburgh Review of 1820, we have been able to meet with  nothing on the subject, and in these, wilh a very few facts.  The following statements are such as have casually fallen in  j   my way, and I alone am answerable for their errors.  Before the melancholy fall of Warsaw, Poland boasted  the most efficient military academy, perhaps, with a single  exception, in all Europe. The course of studies embraced  the classics, as well as mathematics, superadding the modern  languages and line arts. It was accessible only to tho gentleman, who, in Poland, was any one who could trace his lineage 10 royal or distinguished ancestry. From this class, the  army was exclusively officered. For the efficiency of their  academy, we have but to refer to the actions of that gallant and  devoted little band, with iho countless numbers of tyrant  Russia. In no battle of that Rovoltltion, which has ended  in the ruin, and almost extermination of the Poles, were five  hundred Russians equal to one hundred Poles, commanded  j  by a commissioned officer.   It was in the military department  ' ol the university of Warsaw, that the first blow of resistance  was given to the aggressions of the monster, Nicholas. The  objects of military education were realized in an eminent degree in Poland, though the northern snows, ever prolific in  savage hordes, furnished numbers sufficient to crush her to  i ihe dust.  la Prussia, a military school was established by Frederic  the great, and nurtured with particular care. How thorough  was its course of studies, we have not been able to determine;  but il wc may judge from the taste and acquirements of its  learned founder, any course of his appointment was extensive  raid profound. Such was its influence, says the Edinburgh  Encyclopadia, that, at the death of Frederic, the Prussian  "nay was the finest in the world. Yet no sooner did his  nephew, Frederic William, ascend the throne, than luxury  and idleness entered the military academy, and it fell into  decay. From this time, we hear little more of Prussian mil-  i'ary education.  The English army has long ranked high among the armies of nations for the bravery and patriotism of its soldiers,  and the courtly manners of its officers. And perhaps in no  case has the influence of court, in an enlightened nation, been  so great in establishing nn elevated rank for a class of so little mental acquirement. It is certainly a matter of some astonishment, that where deep learning is so abundant and cheap  a commodity,—where the results of mental effort meet so  prompt and liberal patronage, and where national pride is, in  so high a degree, based upon Ihe intellectual attainments of  the belter circles of society,-—that military schools should  have met with such parsimonious encouragement]—ihat such  scanty means have been furnished, for elevating this large  portion of the very first circles, to an intellectual equality  with those among whom they mingle. "And if there be any-  dear friend" of old England present, wo must beg his indulgence, whilst we describe, as il is, the attention paid to education in the Engligh army. For, as truth, as well as juntico,  is our object, while wo admit their bravery and patriotism  equal to that of any other nation, wc must not forget that education is our theme.  England has an independent military college at Mnrlow,  in which those who anticipate connection with the army, may  study, at their own expense, whatever they may deem worthy  of their attention.    Suffice it to say of Marlow college, that  few students make rare; proficiency here, since it affects very  slightly the favoritism of appointments, nor gives them title to  higher rank or more rapid promotion, than him whose commission is purchased for a few hundred pounds, without the  benefit of any education.    At Portsmouth there is a naval  academy, where pupils are taught something of mechanical  navigation.     Their tuition  is paid  by government, and all  other expenses by themselves.    Their rank while' here is that  of an entered mid-shipman; and their time of service, antecedent to a commission, is abridged by as much time as they  spend in the academy,  never exceeding two years.    Those  who know that midshipmen arc entered at the tender age of  leven to twelve years, must be aware bow limited must be  the naval education of two years, and of how little: value is  the mechanical knowledge they get of the long and abstruse;  calculation necessary in practical navigation.   At Woolwich,  however, there is a military academy supported by government patronage, to which cadets are appointed by warrant,  and educated lo the number of one hundred and eighty, constantly.   Their instruction, (which embraces all the branches  essential to a military education,) costs Ihe nation Is Gd each  per day; and we leave it to the candor of any man to judge  how liberal is this expenditure, when we reflect ihat the standing forces of Great Britain amount to more than hnlf a million ; that the number of commissioned officers necessary to  their command, is fully thirty-five thousand; that the vacancies occurring from death, resignation, nnd dismission, amount  to full ten percent, yearly, which is three thousand five hundred.    If one  fourth of the cadets at Woolwich graduate  yearly, the institution will fill one vacancy of every seventy-  seven, a meagre, ridiculous proportion, indeed, of men of military science in that immense body, the Britiih army.    And  the results of this melancholy deficiency, are, that their few en-  •■ HM  m  • *&gt; it  ■t%  m  ■  ':;• I'd  ;;  '•:   '• 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/489	489	490.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/490.jp2

It is to one trained lo the  observation of thoso minute and evanescent irregularities,  which are usually deemed plain, and to such only, thnt can  be entrusted the correct representation of grounds; and lo the  performance of such a task, a much more thorough know-  ledge of the principles of his art, are essential, than is voluntarily learned. Correct representation in drawing, is a means  of improving the observation, and correct draftsmen, alone,  can be entrusted with the proper recollection of grounds for  action.    It thus becomes important, that all military officftl  should bo well taught in the science of  perspective.  and ibe  drawing dependent upon it. » An action is often fought b)f  positions,—by means of manoeuvres based upon features ol  ground apparently the most trivial.

If then it be granted that each nation should keep forces  always prepared for its protection; (and who dare deny this?)  and if it be impossible, as we have shown, to obtain competent officers for the various duties and departments of warfare  the necessity of military schools for their  education wil  tullow.  « # # * * #  2dly. We have promised to show how far the objects of  military education aro effected in several European countries  and compare them with our own. In this department, the  extreme dearth of facts on record, will render my lecture still  more barren of interest. The subject of militaiy education  seems never to have engaged the pen of an able, writer; and  if we except a low general views in Edge worth's " Profession,  al Education," and an eccentric and paradoxical article in the  Edinburgh Review of 1820, we have been able to meet with  nothing on tho subject, and in these, with a very few facts.  The following statements are such as have casually fallen in  my way, and 1 alone am answerable for their errors.  Before the melancholy fall of Warsaw, Poland boasted  the most efficient military academy, perhaps, with a single  exception, in all Europe. The course of studies embraced  the classics, as well as mathematics, superadding the modern  languages and fine avis. It was accessible only to the gentleman, who, in Poland, was any one who could trace hislin  cage to royal or distinguished ancestry, From this class, the  army was exclusively officered. For the efficiency of their  academy, we have but to refer to the actions of that gallant and  devoted little band, with the countless numbers of tyrant  Russia. In no battle of that Revolution, which has ended  in ihe ruin, and almost extermination of the Poles, were five  hundred Russians equal to one hundred Poles, commanded  by a commissioned officer. It was in the military department  ol the university of Warsaw, that the first blow of resistance  was given to the aggressions of the monster, Nicholas. The  objects of military education were realized in an eminent degree in Poland, tbough the northern snows, ever prolific in  savage hordes, furnished numbers sufficient to crush her to  ihe dust.  In Prussia, a military school was established by Frederic  Ihe great, and nurtured with particular care. How thorough  was its course of studies, we have not been able to determine;  Wt if we may judge from the taste and acquirements of its  learned founder, any course of his appointment was extensive  and profound. Such was its influence, says the Edinburgh  Encyclopaedia, that, at the death of Frederic, the Prussian  army was the finest in the world. Yet no sooner did his  nephew, Frederic William, ascend the throne, than luxury  "id idleness entered the military academy, and it fell into  decay. From this time, we hear little more of Prussian mil-  l,;"y education,  The English army has long ranked high among the armies of nations for the bravery and patriotism of its soldiers,  and the courtly manners of its officers. And perhaps in no  case has the influence of court, in an enlightened nation, been  so great in establishing an elevated rank for a class of so lit-  tie mental acquirement. It is certainly a matter of some astonishment, that where deep learning is so abundant and cheap  a commodity,—where the results of mental effort meet so  prompt and liberal patronage, and where national pride is, in  so high a degree, based upon the intellectual attainments of  the better circles of society,—thnt military schools should  have met with such parsimonious encouragement;—that such  scanty means have been furnished, for elevating this large  portion of the very first circles, to an intellectual equality  with those among whom they mingle. "And if there be any-  dear friend" of old England present, we must beg his indul.  gence, whilst we describe, as if is, the attention paid to education in the Engligh army. For, as truth, as well as justice,  sour object, while wo admit their bravery and patriotism  equal to that of any other nation, wc must not forget that education is our theme.  England has an independent military college at Marlow,  in which those who anticipate connection with tho army, may  study, at their own expense, whatever they may deem worthy  of their attention.    Suffice it to say of Marlow college, that  few students make rare proficiency here, since it affects very  slightly the favoritism of appointments, nor gives them title to  higher rank or more rapid promotion, than him whoso commission is purchased for a few hundred pounds, without the  benefit of any education.    At Portsmouth  there is a naval  academy, where pupils are taught something of mechanical  navigation.     Their tuition  is paid  by government, and all  other expenses by themselves.    Their rank while here is that  of an entered miel-sliipman; and their time of service, antecedent to a commission, is abridged by as much time as they  spend in the academy,  never exceeding two years.    Those  who know that midshipmen arc entered at the tender age of  eleven to twelve years, must be aware how limited must bo  the naval education of two years, and of how little value is  the mechanical knowledge they get of the long and abstruse  calculation necessary in practical navigation.   At Woolwich,  however, there is a military academy supported by government patronage, to which cadets arc appointed by warrant,  and educated to the number of one hundred and eighty, constantly.   Their instruction, (which embraces all the branches  essential to a military education,) costs the nation 2s 6d each  per day; and we leave it to the candor of any man to judge  how liberal is this expenditure, when we reflect that the standing forces of Great Britain amount to more than half a million ; that the number of commissioned officers necessary to  their command, is fully thirty-five thousand; that the vacancies occurring from death, resignation, and dismission, amount  to full ten per cent, yearly, which is three thousand five hundred.    If one  fourth of the cadets at Woolwich graduate  yearly, the institution will fill one vacancy of every seventy-  seven, a meagre, ridiculous proportion, indeed, of men of mil-  ary science in that immense body, the British army.    And  the results of this melancholy deficiency, are.that their few en-  ■mi  ■-■»SJL  '■■I'M  •'.

For who but a  military man can describe an action as it occurs? who, I say,  nol well versed in tho science, can describe the many evolutions, manoeuvres, and stratagems of battle, appreciate their  effect upon the result, and render praise to whom praise is  due? As well might the clown who has never had a thought  beyond the margin of his father's estate, attempt to tlescribe  the manual of chemical analysis, as for the moon-struck poet,  or the perpetrator of love-sick tales and silly novels, to describe the complicated movements and awful grandeur of the  battle-field. England has felt the want of officers, who have  sufficient talent, taste, and time, to write the history of the wars  in which they have taken part. And the writer alluded to in  the Edinburgh Review, laments this deficiency in lugubrious  accents, whilst he attacks, with fill the virulence of ignorance,  the idea that the time of cadets should bo wasted in the study  of mathematics, the very basis of all military science. No  writer of history, perhaps, at any age, has laid himself more  liable to the ridicule of military men, lhan Sir Walter Scott,  in his life of Napoleon. The venerable novelist had been  too long the writer of historical romance, not to tinge this  biography with the coloring of fiction. Aside from the silly  and disgusting extreme to which he carries English prejudice against the French character and nation, he makes some  of tho grossest blunders, in his allusions to military movements, etiquet and rank. As nn instance, he tells you that  Napoleon was promoted from Brigadier General to the com-  mandancy of a battalion, which, so far from promotion, would  bo a degradation.  In naval warfare, the deficiency noticed, is still greater  than in the army: and the most magnificent displays of human skill, decision of character, and promptness, are entrusted to the pens of those who perhaps never were out of sight  of land, and who certainly can have, no adequate conception  of what they are writing about. If it be urged, that tin-  British navy boasts an exception, at present, in a very popular writer, we would say, in reply, that if a certain Captain  Maryatt, instead of writing low, vulgar, and unnatural (though  funny) novels, challenging critics, and degrading his profession, by leaving,his country to peddle trash to American theatres, would devote his perverted, yet respectable powers, to  editing a history of British naval actions, England might be  immensely the gainer, and wc, most certainly, nothing the  loser. For we hold, that nothing which ever happened, has  added such an impetus to the corrupting taste of American  novel-readers, as the writings of the said quondam officer of  Royal Navy. We feel safe in offering a guinea for every  moral reflection or abstract thought, contained in Japhet, or  Jacob Faithful, which does not carry its antidote in the same  or adjacent page.—Pardon the warmth which has led mo a  moment from my subject;—for the sentiments I make no apology. From the above remarks, it will be found, that the  great objects of military education, are far from being effected in England.  The Polytechnic school, in France, is certainly tho most  efficient institution for military education  in Europe.    The  method adopted for the selection of the cadets, is worfhyol  all imitation | and calculated, unquestionably, to render the  officers of her army tho most accomplished and cfUciem in  the world. "Admittance is not to bo gained by favor, or t|:(,  highest interest and recommendation, but by merit alone.. 'J ]it.  members are selected from the provincial and preparatory  schools, where tho pupils undergo, yearly, a strict examina.  tion. The competition is great and public; and it is scarcely  possible that any youth should obtain the wished for entrance  without superior industry, talents, and knowledge." The  Polytechnic school is, as its name indicates, the theatre where  many arts are learned. In addition to the course of ninihe.  matics and exact sciences, which are more thoroughly taught  here than in any European university, the cadets learn several blanches of manual industry, such as carpentry, arehi.  lecture, masonry, &c; and not from diagram and theory, but  from the manual application of theory. They are also taught  in the modern languages of the nations, whose proximity and  importance render it necessary. This is the more essential,  as their soldiery is composed of men speaking so many Languages. The ancient languages are, as they should be, considered of minor importance to the military profession, as ils  technicalities are neither Latin nor Greek, nor is the military  officer likely to come often in contact with men who speak  exclusively either. ' Natural science and drawing constitute  an important department; and all things which tend to the  perfect development of tho physical system, are alternated  philosophically with study. Thousands of the ablest candidates are thus led, by the certainly, if successful, that government will permanently provide for them, to propose themselves candidate: for election; and all the rays of national  talent are thus concentrated upon military science. Napoleon, who left his mark for weal or wo, wherever he tied,  was a cadet of a military academy, and the Polytechnic  school is a prouder monument to his memory than the field of  Austerlilz. Would that his conqueror at Waterloo, another  offspring of a military education, had shown the same gratitude to the origin of his greatness I The objects of military  education have been eminently realized in France, though  only one hundred and fifty officers are yearly graduated.  This is sufficient to supply the army with efficient engineers,  gunners, and architects, though not sufficient to fill the vacancies of their immense army.  Wo have already hinted at the United States' Military Academy, nnd its origin. Wc shall proceed to show how, and in  what degree, it effects, in the army, and in tho American community, the objects of its creation. Admittance is gained by  warrant issued by the Secretary of War, with the advice and  consent of the President. They are based upon recommendations, usually presented by the representative in Congress  from the district of the applicant's residence. The maximum  number is two-hundred and fifty, chosen from tho States in  proportion to representation in Congress. Preference is  given, (ceteris paribus, to the sons of revolutionary soldiers,  and distinguished officers of the late war. No other preference is known, and I feci called upon to say, from actual  and careful examination, that the proportion of cadets, sons  of distinguished men, or politicians, is habitually small: no1 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/492	492	493.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/493.jp2

The  irtion wo sometimes hear, that the institution is aristocratic  ,n I accessible only to the rich and influential, is either deli  Urate slander, or betrays the ignorance of its origin.  The location of this institution is ono of its happiest fea-  tures.   Adorned, as il  is,  by every beauty and grandeur  which the lavish hand of nature can bestow, it has also the  ndvantngo of being most classic in revolutionary history.  And when, on a bitter winter's night, the cadet is treading his  sentinel post, ruminating upon the  hardships of a soldier's  profession, and feeling his limbs begin to grow numb with  cold, be catches, perhaps, a starlight gleam of the crumbling  battlements of Fort Putnam, on tho highland brow above  him, and in a moment, the images of a daring Putnam, a beloved Kosciusko,  a revered La Fayette, and nn immortal  Washington are before him,    He is Heading whore limy  toiled and agonized for liberty,—he quickens his pace, forgets  ihat il is cold, and perhaps before another relief comes round,  aib'opnf perspiration might be scon on the brow of the cm-  bryo bore).    From the character of a  Putnam, whose name  the fort bears, he learns that the sternest military rigor is not  inconsistent with the; kind offices of mercy, charily, and philanthropy.    From Kosciusko, its engineer and builder, ho  lenrnstho glory of sacrificing country, home, and friends, "to  crusade for freedom, in freedom's holy land."   The beauteous  garden of nature, which bears his name, is kept fresh and  green by youths who cherish his memory.    His favorite retreat was here in this sequestered nook, against that stupendous overhanging rock, fit emblem this of ihe holy cause he  fought in, for thus did bleeding America lean for support upon the " Rock of Ages."     In the midst of this garden, there  stands a large vase; of tho purest while; marble, and from its  bottom, a clear fountain springs perennial, and upon its mar  !:in is carved, simply,  "Kosciusko."    And upon the most  conspicuous spot in the plain, there stands a monument, of the  sun.' pure marble, so that stranger passes not, without witnessing the lasting gratitude of cadets, and reading the revered  name "Kosciusko."    From"Washington's valley," another  beauteous and retired spot, where leaping cascades and dashing water-falls, "make music ever," and laurels grow perennial, as if to crown the valo which bears the name of the  departed hero—from this the cadet is reminded ofthe character of the father of his country.    And from his example he  may learn—what may he not learn?    At the mention of that  name, the proudest soldier might bow tho knee of humility,  and beseech his Maker for the most distant resemblance to  'his model of excellencies.    Fort Putnam, and the Hudson,  which sweeps beneath it, and " Robison's house " beyond, are  all eloquent with the black and changeless infamy of a once  distinguished American officer, who bartered his bleeding  country for the gold of the oppressor.    The lesson taught by  contrasting his memory with thnt of those whose duties wero  in and nobly done, never fails to make a salutary impression  "pan him who is just entering upon the threshold of his mil-  "ary career.    So tho young mariner upon the ocean wave,  who sees here and there a gallant sail leap proudly over tho  waters, and on another S'.le a single wreck- dashing among  ihe breakers, turns from the dangers: of an untried channel,  and speeds him to his moorings, where tho channel is known  and the waters deep and placid. These are a (rw of the  most prominent appendages, which render West Point a happy location for a military academy. And my audience  will pardon me, if the remembrance of days of tho soldier's  joy and pride, has betrayed me from my subject, as ihe reality-  has often lured mo from more, imperative duties.  Tho method ndopted by government of selecting cadets,  we deem highly objectionable, and liable to the grossest  abuses. How easy is it, at all times and for any person, to  procure as many recommendations as may be desired, as  there is no lad whom somebody does not think smart. And  by this very means, we find an entering class of cadets, nearly as promiscuous in regard to talents as any body of young  men taken at random. It is nol sufficient that a few months'  cadetship sifts out the blockheads, and leaves the talented for  graduation. For how many pangs must it cost fond parents,  to find their sons dismissed in that very public manner for  imbecility or indolence; and how many young men are ruined by the oil in in attached to such a dismission, From a class  of one hundred and twenty, the number of graduates will  usually be forty: fully a third beingfound deficient or dismissed, or resign to avoid ono or the other: tho other third  leaving from disgust or the request of their friends, and a few  from ill health, How easily might all this expense to the  rovemment and ruin of character bo avoided, were we to  adopt the; French plan of selecting from public and thorough  examination, young men of talents, industry, nnd robust constitution I  That the; objects of military education are fully realized  in the United Stales, our army will answer for itself.    Perhaps in no army, not even the French, are the officers uniformly men of so high attainment; and for the plain reason,  that the only avenue to the army is through the Military  Academy.    Besides the mere; officering the army, another  object is effected, which is peculiar to the United States, namely—ihe diffusing among community such acquirements as  are obtained only in military schools: so that, in the event of  war, tho militia may have active and efficient gunners, engineers and commanders.    This necessity arises from the United number of our standing forces, and the necessity of nn  immediate call upon the militia in ense of war.   Education, in  the military academy nt West Point, is equally thoiough in  its departments, though embracing fewer subjects than in ihe  Polytechnic school.    Yet, in the latter, each is appointed to  bis department of Engineering, Gunnery, or Architecture,  and omits both the others;  whilst, in the United States, each  cadet masters the whole course.    The result is, that France  has officers of a more profound acquaintance with a single  branch, whilst we have them of higher general accomplishment.    We shall not decide between the merits of these systems, as each is probably best adapted to the nation in which  it obtains.     In .both,  however, a sufficient knowledge and  taste for scientific research is gained, to enable the army officers to devote their leisure, which, in time of peace, is great,  to the prosecution of their studies.

In both  countries, a vast advantage is possessed over the English or.  my, in respect to the- pursuits of their leisure. Nothing can  surpass, if equal, the conviviality (not lo say dissipation,) of  the officers of the English army. Cards and bumpers are  infinitely moro popular than books and philosophy; and for  the plain reason, that their education is originally deficient,  and their leisure and pay ample. In justice to the English,  we should say of their rivals the French, that a majority of  their officers are not belter educated than the English, but  they are of a more enterprising and active character, have  much moro duty to perform, and cannot support leisure with  such contented and idle dignity. An officer in England  gains access lo the best sociely, by his rank; in France by  his gallantry or scientific enterprise, und in the United States  by his industry, accomplishments, and behavior.  Silly. The next department of our subject, is to examine  the effects of military education upon individual mind, and  national character. It will not be difficult to conclude', that  the course of study and discipline, pursued in these schools,  must engender habits of great effort, profound and connected  thought. But, further, il induces a habit of systematizing  and classifying, and testing every thing by a standard of  known accuracy. All the benefits (and they are many) of  mathematical study, are gained by the military student; among  which we find the discipline of the reasoning powers, by that  profound and only intelligible species of logic, geometric  demonstration and Algebraic analysis. A thorough course  of the exact, ns of the natural sciences, inspires with admiration at the magnificent machinery of the universe, the beauty and perfect adaptation of all things to their purposes ; and  with reverence for the divine source.' whence all originated.  It has been objected, and not without an appearance of  plausibility, that a military education engenders a war spirit,  hardens the heart, and blunts the affections: and these objections, if valid, are most serious ones; and we feel called upon  to examine them. • It should first be remembered that officers  of an army are not remunerated in proportion to the battles  they fight or the; blood they shed. Their profession is salaried, and their compensation is neilher enhanced by active  services, nor diminished by the leisure of peace. If it st  be urged that men always wish to distinguish themselves in  their profession, anel that war only furnishes the man of arms  this opportunity,—we can but acknowledge that uneducated  and ambitious men—those whose contracted philanthropy  could desire a reputation at the expense of innocent, or unnecessary blood, and whoso minds can find no occupation to  relieve the lassitude of idleness and dissipation,—these ma  and most generally do thirst for actual service. But just  here we discover a new argument for military education • to  enlarge the views and give a taste for mental culture; to instil a patriotism too expanded to wish one's country stained  t wilh blood, anel yet to be prepared in case of necessity to  render efficient service wilh the greatest saving of human  life. How despicable would appear a judge, who would  seek his own renown by endeavoring to produce crime and  litigation ; or the physician, who, to exhibit his healing skill,  should poison the fountains of his  vicinity.    Examples of  this kind are rare, and yet objections might be urged against  the study of law for the civil magistracy, with (he same propriety, as against tho military officer. And in regard to  blunting the finer feelings, it may be true of common soldiery who have seen much service, as it is of the hang-man or  guillotine executioner: but 'tis no more true of the noble-  minded officer than ofthe magistrate or physician. "A  taste; for sanguinary sights, has ever been the characteristic  of weak and cowardly dispositions. Merely being accustomed to the sight of blood, wounds and death, has no tendency to make men brave. Where there is no personal hazard, no intrepidity can be shown." The tendency, then, of  military education, so far from rendering men callous to human suffering, in making them intrepid, is, on the contrary,  rather to render them keenly alive to others' woes, and to bc  prompt in relieving them. The officer stands, as it were, a  sentinel on the watch-towers of his country, not longing for  a struggle in which he must suffer, and perhaps die, but  ready to (ire his signal gun at the approach of danger, and  awake his fellow guards to the rescue.  If these are the effects of military education upon individual  mind, its influence upon national character follows, anel partakes of tho same nature. The promptness and efficiency ofn  nation's defence elevates it in the estimation of neighboring  powers, at the same time that it deters the ambitious and grasping, from insult and aggression. But the greatest influence is  exerted at home in the security of its inhabitants. A people  constantly exposed to the sword of its neighbors, is harrassed  by fear, and drawn from the duties of domestic industry; bul  when national defence is ample, tranquility and happiness  abound, and prosperity and plenty crown the; inhabitants.  Finally and briefly. How far may military discipline he  introduced, with advantage, inlo civil institutions of learning.'  Several military schools have been established and conduct-  eel with great success in the United States, yet, if I mistake  not, they have all been too exclusively military, for an advantageous preparation for either of the learned professions.  They have followed too nearly the subjects taught in the  United States Academy; and for the general education every  young man should have in setting out in life, this is too exclusive. Most of these military attainments arc absolutely  lost. We believe, however, that an institution, whose course  of studies is that ordinarily pursued in college, and whose  discipline is military—all duties enforced with military rigor,  and tho necessary exercise of its students taken in drilling,  would ensure a degree of order and acquirement, at present  unknown to civil institutions. And for several very cogent  reasons. First, a uniform dress had a wonderful influence  in levelling distinctions, as all, by this means, appear with  equal neatness and gentility; and military pride, which soon  springs up in the young, when uniformed and drilled, has  an equally surprising effect upon tho conduct. An appeal  to the honor of a soldier will eflect more than the fear ofpun-  ishment from a score of laws, occasionally executed. Besides, in no civil institution does punishment tread invariably  upon the "heels" of delinquency, as in military law; ami  the punishments of civil law, though often physically more  severe, carry wilh  them much less of poignant  odium and 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/494	494	495.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/495.jp2

Nor  would I recommend that it interfere at all with the usual  collegiate courses of study. Those are too well established  by the wisdom of ages, to be lightly thrown aside; and far  he il from me to recommend that colleges be converted into  military schools, such as national academies. But if all the  advantages we have suggested accrue from the bare intro-  ilui-tion of military discipline; and if it give encouragement  to youth, to make something of external display, and attract  tin., attention and plaudits of an admiring community—for one,  we would raise our hands and our voice for military colleges.  for tlio South.Women  SOLITUDE.  0 would not love, when chilling care nnd grief  ig mi ihe mind like some autumnal cloud,  1 sits upon the azure face of heaven,  dves llic cheerful sun of all his brightness,  casts deep gloom upon the sombre earth;  a would not love the silent hoiiraud place,  ere wounded souls may freely tell of wo,  hole! communion with themselves alone—  fearless of th' unfeeling world's black tongue 1  Journal.

A Iree of moderate size, umbra-  geous, spreading; from thirty lo forty feet high; of rapid  growth, flourishing only in hot climates. Leaves bi-pinnata  and alternate, forming bunches towards tho extremities of the  branches; leaflets, smoolhe, ovate, and dentate: flowers odorous, somewhat like jessamine or lilach: calyx small, five-  parted; petals-five; nectary cylindrical, ten-toothed ; orific internally antherifovous ; stylo cylindric ; stigma five-rayed ;  fruit a globose drupe in bunches or clusters; nut five-celled  and five-seeded. Blossoms early in April, in numerous li-  lnch-colored panicles or corymbs ; berries when ripe yellow  or light russet.  This is one of the most common shade and ornamental  trees in the southern states, It embowers almost every private residence, and is often used to shade the sidewalks of our  cities and our public promenades; it is found about almost  every habitation in Mississippi and Louisiana, whether ofthe  bond or free; and often in onr worn-out and waste.fields, a  cluster of china trees alone marks out the site of some former  dwelling.  This tree was originally a native of India and southern  China ; but lias now become naturalized to the southern parts  of the United States, where it grows most luxuriently. It  will not stand the winters of the United States north of 34",  and severe winters, as far north as 31" and 32°, kill the tender  branches.  In winter, when its foliage; is all cast, it exhibits a few  branches, rather thick and stubbed, similar to the branches of  the catalpa or fig tree, and to a stranger it would be the last  to attract his attention as a shade tree. But in spring, it sends  forth numerous radiated bunches of leaves upon long branching petioles, which render it in summer one of the most  densely covered trees known. The foliage is of a deep rich  green, darker than almost any other tree. The smell of the  leaves is decidedly narcotic ; their shape is oval and acuminate, about the size of the wild cherry leaf.  In ordinary years, south of latitude 33" it flowers early in  April, though in cold springs not until the fifteenth ; being  one of the latest in its vegitation as well as inflorescence.  The flowers come out in clusters very numerous around the  extremities of the small branches, and at several other points  below the extremities. So numerous are the flowers that  during the period of inflorescence, which precedes the foliage about five or six days, that the whole tree appears like  one great lilach bush in bloom. A few days exhibit clusters of deep green leaves interspersed through the blossoms,  until the trees exhibit one mass of deep green foliage mixed,  with the most gorgeous flowers. During the period of inflorescence the whole atmosphere around is perfumed with a  strong, but slightly narcotic fragrance. Tho flowers are  succeeded by clusters of green hard pulpy berries, which attain their growth about the middle of July, and begin to ripen and change to a light russet or yellow color about the  first of October. These berries are about the size of the  small northern red-haws. They remain and cover the ex-  remities of the branches, and give the tree al a distance the  ' 1  ■ i    J"  '".Il  ■' ''^v!  • '#11  ■ m  m  m  ;]!■' ;i  :&gt; '•  ■ j$j :  11  ■-  fp  I   '■'.  ■ i'  .  1 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/495	495	496.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/496.jp2

These berries are eaten by  horses and cattle as soon as they fall, especially when the  grasses are gone. Birds also feed upon them, especially robins in winter; upon which a singular narcotic effect is pro-  duccel, whereby they are so far deprived of muscular motion  as to bo unable to fly or escape from those who attempt to  take them. I have seen a similar effect produced in children who have eaten many of them : for the berries although  extremely bitter and narcotico-acrid when green, are rather  pleasant when they have been exposed to the frost. Cat  and sheep have been killed by having eaten largo quantities  of them.  The inner bark of this tree, especially of tho root, is one  of the best vermifuges known in the south; and is that generally used by the inhabitants for such purposes in children.  If given in too largo quantities, especially in March and  April while the sap is rising, it produces dilatation ofthe pupil, stertorous breathing, and other symptoms which soon  pass oil" without any permanent injury. It is also a valuable medicine for horses in spring, for improving tho state of  tho blood and causing a fine coat of hair to bo produced.  This is one of the most valuable trees in the southern  country, in another point of view, that of timber either for  fencing or for oilier purposes, and for none is it more nscful  than for fuel. For tho latter purpose the older trees are  eepial to the best hickory; and its growth is so rapid that it  will doubtless be found a matter of great importance to cu  tivate it in largo quantities, as the natural forests disappear  &gt;^r before agriculture. Tho china tree can be cultivated with  much less labor, with more cerlainty and in a shorter time  than even the; black locust: and in all respects it is much  more valuable.  On the cultivation of it we transcribe the following extract from tho Southern Agriculturalist, for June, 183G, viz:  ■ " Tin; best method of cultivating the Pride of India, that  I have discovered is the following. Make a hole about six  inches deep and fill it with well rotted manure from the stable, or compost, with old forest leaves, every eight feet; into  each of which drop four or live berries, which arc to be  lightly covered. This should bo done in March or April.  When they begin to come up attend the young plants as you  would cotton, keeping down the grass and weeds, and pulling  up the weak and slender shoots, leaving only ono of the most  healthy and vigorous. Go over this twice in the course of  three months, with a plough, turning over tho furrow to the  plants. The young trees will rapidly grow to the height of  six or eight feet. During this time, you must occasionally  strip off the leaves and lateral shoots in order to trim the  steins to a proper length. Keep them merely as straight  twigs, (to which they will naturally tend,) until the next  spring, when you will direct them to grow as upright as possible, keeping down weeds and grass as during the year previously. In this year they }vill attain the thickness of about  twelve inches in circumference, and by tho next spring the  height of twelve or fifteen foot. Tho growth may however  be improved by the use of the hoc and manure. They may  now be permitted to put out lateral limbs, suffering Ihe most  vigorous In continue, and removing the weak ones, whi|,.  young, with a priming knife. This will preserve the cpialj.  ty and benuty of the timber, making it, in fifteen years, fit  for all manner of furniture."  We would suggest the facility of procuring scions by pre.  paring long trenches with manure, &c. instead of the holes,  for the purpose of sprouting the seeds; from which as a nip.  scry the young shoots may be safely removed after Iho first  year, and planted in rows about eight or ten feet apart each  way. In this manner, by preparing the ground for the reception ol each plant, many of our old waste fields might bo  converted in a few years, into forests of this most valuable  tree.  The author above quoted further observes, "tho value of  tho wood cannot be too highly appreciated. It may be sawed into boards from twelve to eighteen inches wide, fit for almost any purpose, or into wainscoting of the; most beautiful  shades. It is a light sonorous wood, not apt to split, and capable of very high polish. It is entirely divested of any resinous matter, and thereby is fitted to receive the most beautiful- varnishes. It possesses powerful vermifuge qualities, anil  is therefore suitable for all furniture for the bedchamber, as  no bugs, nor any other insects will infest it. The lexturcor  quality of the wood may be improved by being grown on  land of a clay bottom ; but it will grow on tho loosest sandy  loam. It should be raised from the seeds in the manner 1  have described. If transplanted when large, its top roots  will never grow, and it will be more liable to be blown down,  being supported only by lateral roots, which derive their pabulum from the rich loam on the surface, and give to tho wood  a soft spongy texture.  " As an article for fence posts I can safely recommend it  as one ofthe cheapest and most durable. In this latter quality it approximates more nearly to cedar than any wood 1  know. It may be planted along tho line to be covered by  the fence, and the rails may ho nailed to the tree as a post.  The superfluous branches will afford excellent fire wood.  " Horses, cows, hogs and sheep will eat the leaves greedily. When dried and mixed with hay, it is the best medicine I know for cattle of every kind. Such are the vermifuge qualities of the entire tree, that I never fail to give itlo  my animals every spring. A fow leaves given to a horse  once or twice a week, will afford him a most beautiful coal  of hair. A decoction of its root in small doses administered  to children every morning for eight or nine days, will efl'ec-  tually destroy worms in them." M ■  Extraordinary Experiment.—Professor Locke, of  the Medical College of Ohio, has invented a thermo-electric  instrument, of such delicacy and power, that by tho electricity  generated by the warmth from a touch of the finger, a magnetic needle eleven inches long, and weighing one and a hall  ounces, suspended like a compass needle, is not only reflected.  but made to rotate rapidly and repeatedly round. This is tho  more surprising, as the electric conductor does not touch tho  conductor, but passes one-fourth of an inch from it. Perhapf  so much motion has seldom before been produced by so little  heat.—Cincinnati Republican. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/496	496	497.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/497.jp2

The heavenly hosts wheel their trackless courses with  inieleviating exactness nnd order: tho seasons perform their  appointed circuits: the myriads of animated existences, crowding "every portal and avenue " of this busy world, live their  little hour, and are gone to make room for their successors.  Throu'diout the whole universe all is harmony, System  and law seem stamped upon the very face of nature. Its  very jarrings and discords are instinct with order and beauty.  Blind indeed must be he, who, in all the operations of nature,  so multifarious and intricate, yet so unchanging and constant,  ran see no directing power, no moving, controlling principle,  but chance; who can look out upon the broad face of the  universe, noting every change, and watching the progress of  every event, and believe that all things are casual; that th.  very system of nature is chained to the car of a blind and  soulless contingency.'  But how is this beautiful and harmonious system of the  universe lo be maintained ? Where, or in what, does the  moving, controlling, and governing power reside?  Many and diverse theories have been advanced by philosophers upon this subject. Some indue matter with qualities  of life, making certain active powers essentially inherent in  it, from whose action result all the phenomenn of nature.  But this scheme of materialism is altogether baseless, as has  been frequently and fully shown. Other philosophers toll  us, that the phenomena of nature result from the action of  certain powers, not indeed essentially inherent in matter, but  which were communicated lo it by its creator. But this theory finds few supporters. Indeed both, to free themselves  from absurdity, should have advanced a step farther, and coa  lescod with another theory, which supposes that matter has  mind; that all motion results from, anel is maintained by, a  material intelligence. Kepler, who adopted this last theory,  supposes thai the planets are indued with minds, fur more  grasping and acute than our own, and that, in order to regulate their own movements, they have the power of making  observations upon the apparent diameter of the sun.  1'hc planets, then, are animals—and if so, there may be  no absurdity in supposing, that the planets originated, and of  themselves maintain llieir own motions. But, if this is not  true: if they are not animals, then, to say that the planets  havo minds, conveys to us no more knowledge, than to say  !'iat they are obedient lo the power of gravitation or attrac-  iction of every  part, control all tho changes of matter, cause life lo die, and  out of death bring life.  But in comparison with all these theories, how simple,  beautiful and sublime, how consistent with the light of reason,  and tho teachings of the; word of Ood, and how consonant  with the feelings of every devout, unprejudiced, and Christian  heait, is the doctrine which supposes all ihe phenomena of  nature to be the immediate effects of the Divine agency that,  not only was the mighty building of the universe reared by  the hand of Deity, but that, were his upholding power  withdrawn for a moment even, the vast and finished edifice  would heave from ils broad and deep foundations, and tho  world, now so beautiful and harmonious, become an univer-  sal wreck, one mighty chaos ? How vague, confused, und  uncertain, are. the notions commonly entertained in regard to  this subject? Wo examine the operations of nature, we explore its deep and wonderful mysteries; we view the thronging multitudes of animated beings, which now cover the  earth; we turn our gaze upward, and as our eye wanders  from planet to planet and from sun to sun, our minds struggle,  in vain, to grasp "the terrible magnitude ofthe starry :.kics;"  wo turn back to ages far gone down on the stream of time, and  their rccorelstell us ofthe same operations, tho same changes,  the same vast and complicated movements, the same busy  world, and the same starry heavens; and wc feel that duration  and permanency are Stamped upon the whole system of nature, and that this permanency is essential and inherent. Wo  do not feel, to adopt the eloquent language of the author of  the Natural History of Enthusiasm, "that the massy pillars  of creation, with its towering superstructure, and ils high-  lion.  Other philosophers tell us, that the universe is but one vast,  m'ghty, and complicated machine, formed with such exquisite  Skill by the hand of Deity, that being once put in motion, it  moves on harmoniously, and, unless stopped by the hand of its  Creator, forever. This theory, though, in fact, differing little  from the two first mentioned, has had, under one form or other, many able and pious supporters. But since, strictly speal.  "'=' '"alter possesses no other power, but the negative one of  t'teri'ia, the impulse, first given bv the Deity, must, of a neccs  wrought embellishments, and its innumerable tenants, are absolutely destitute of intrinsic permanency, and that the stupendous frame, with its nice and mighty movements, is incessantly issued tWKJMjfrom the fount of being."  We talk ol "the laws of nature" as if, in the beginning,  the Creator ordained certain regulations, in obedience to  which th e universe was to move on forever We seem to  regard the Deity as a far-off Being, who, having made the  world, and stamped certain immutable laws upon its fiame,  retired into a state of inactivity and rest, almost totally re gard-  less of the concerns of his new-born universe, or busied himself in the creation of other worlds, rearing the magnificent  superstructures of new systems. This phrase,—"the: laws  of nature"—wo clothe, as it were, with an active, living energy; wo make it an all-pervading, ever-operative power,  a mighty, controlling, mysterious agent. In obedience to its  mandates, the planetary systems roll on, ceaseless, untiring.  It speaks, and the ocean, calm and "gentle as an infant's  slumbers," becomes instinct with a fearful, resistless energy.  It breathes upon the land, and its wintry chain is snapped  asunder, the earth decks itself in its beautiful garments, flower* are wreathed into garlands, and smiles and gladness wait  on " the bridal of Nature."

From long  habit and association, wo forget that this phrase, which wo  thus personify, is mere metaphor, strictly speaking an empty  name, adopted by figure of speech, simply to express tho fuel,  —not to account for it—of the uniformity of what wc call  the operations of Nature. Wo forget that law implies an  executor, supposes an agent, without which the law is destitute of all value, has no efficiency, can havo no existence.  Were this not the case, we should feel, that what wecall " laws  of nature," are but expressions of a fact, and that the: divine  agency must pervade the whole universe, causing and direct-  ing every change, producing all motion, harmonizing all  events. With this theory the language of scripture most  fully accords; it is indeed one of its most prominent doctrines.  The beautiful and sublime scriptural representations of the  Divine power and agency, though often dressed in the garb  of poetry, wear not the less tho garb of truth, God rideth  on the wings of the wind;—the clouds are his chariot, the  lightnings are his arrows. Tho raging tempest is bul the  breath of his nostrils; tlio winds of heaven are bul his breath,  and the roaring thunder but the sound of his voice. At his  approach the earth trcnibleth, the foundation's of the hills arc  moved; he; toiiclieth them and they smoke. His pavilion  rour 1 about him are dark waters and thick clouds ol the  skies. At his presence, the mountains flow down. He cov-  ereth himself with light us with a garment. With Him is  terrible majesty; tho whole earth is full of his glory.  Yes, Clod is an every where present Being—an all-pervading, all-directing Spirit. Every operation of nature,  every thing which wo witness around us, speaks, in a loud  voice, of his existence, proclaims that He is here. "His  presence, his spirit is in the air we breathe; our life and our  being are with Him." The doctrine of a divine Providence  rests upon a firm and sure foundation. God is "our Father  in heaven"—but wheic is the meaning of this language—  v, by are wo directed to go to him in times of danger and  distress, to make known to him our wants anel our trials, if  he is indeed the far-off Being, which philosophical theories  would make him? If this world is one vast machine, kept  in million, by an inherent or imparted power, and not by the  immediate agency of the Deily, what are the inward promptings, teaching the untoward barbarian, in seasons of peril to  lilt up his eye to heaven, and pour out his heart's desires in  the ear of the Great Spirit, but delusion? What is tho language of Scripture, which points to God as "the giver of  every good and perfect gift," and assures us, that without his  notice not a sparrow falleth to the ground," and that even "the  very hairs of our heads are all numbered "—what is this language but bitter mockery?

[Published by request.]  Influence, like knowledge, is power, It gives to one ihe  force and the ability of many : and, as influence is often invisible to the superficial spectator, who looks only at the effects  and the proximate agents, it becomes the duty of philosophy  to trace all actions up through the; various agencies to the  first cause. In doing this, the student of mind is often astonished to find, that some of the most illustrious deeds emblazoned on the pages of history, though achieved by the ruder  and sterner sex, were yet the direct results of female influ.  enco.  In accordance with the high example of tho Reverend  gentleman* who delivered the first and foundation lecture before the Ladies' Institute and Lyceum, I shall strive lo make  the few remarks I havo the honor to present, on a topic so  replete with interest, and before an audience so intellectual  anel accomplished, as practical as the nature of the subject  will permit;—at least, so far as to blend the "utile, cum dub  c.c." I am aware: that the Lecture on the " Importance of  Female Education," embraced the; subject I have chosen, as  one of its corollaries. Tho importance of Female Edtica-  cation was argued in view of the Influence the sex must  wield, whether for weal or wo. In selecting it, therefore, os  my theme, I only design to do homage to a master spirit, by  building on his foundation, and adding, if eve:r so little, something to the edifice'of moral beauty, which he contemplated  as tho result of Female; Education,  Of the Importance of Female Education there can be no  question; of the power of Female Influence not a doubt.  Should a philosopher unbosom the motives that actuate a favored youth just coming upon tlio stage of life; show ihat  his earliest aspirations contemplated the favor of a mother, a  sister, or some loved one, whose happiness ho supposed either  to be connected with, or promoted by his success; and should  it be discovered that tho ardor of his spirit was kindled al the  shrine of female virtue and beauty;—that the vision, whether  near at hand or more remote, of female loveliness, beamed in  upon the loneliness of his midnight study, and seemed lo  smile over his feverish and passion-tossed couch, summoning  him again, with the first gray streak of dawn, to climb the  rugged steeps of science, promising him the reward for which  only he sighs, when he shall have entered into the proud  temple of fame which shines afar;—should bis eagle eye he  detected, at the moment he was grasping the highest college  honors within his reach, resting fondly on some loved form  in the audience assembled to do homage to his genius, borrowing inspiration from her glance of approbation and pride;—  should he be followed in after life, and should it be discover-  that the same guiding star shone over his pathway, cheering him in the stormy debate, or lighting him in the arduous  pursuit of wealth, as the divinity of his fortune, before whom  bo would willingly accumulate the gold of the Indies, if'1  might promote her happiness; nnd, at last, should he he  found, when about to leave this world of trial and struggle.  &gt;&lt; 0.

The expression of such a sentiment must bo somewhat mor-  lilVin" t° 'he self-pride of those whose wayward fortunes, or  more wayward vices, have divorced them from this influence,  i|ie guiding star of innocent youth anel virtue; but we fearlessly make it, for the purpose of introducing and sustaining the  leading proposition of the lecture, which is, that as powerful  and as universal ns female influence is, it is no more so than  nature and its creator intended it to bo. The "help-meet for  man"—the being without whom Eden was lonely, and the  first and most beautiful garden of the young earth no paradise', in the more refined and intellectual circles of our renovated nature, holds but the station to which her God assigned  her. The first symptom that the frozen gloom ofthe dark  a"es, which succeeded tho Vandal irruption over tho Rom  empire and the destruction of letters, was breaking, seemed  lo have been a romantic and chivalrous deference to female  charms—the feeble re-kindlings of that holy flame, which,  at first,burned so purely in the pastoral stale of society, prevailing in oriental countries, before the corrupt and ponderous  monarchies crushed the: heart out of tho innocent and happy  institutions of patriarchal life.  In the foundation lecture before this Institute and Lyceum,  we learned what was the great charter of female rights. It  was torn from monkish cells, covered with the dust of centuries, by the intrepid Luther, anel opened to nn admiring  world; it was the book of God! Raised to a proud mental  equality with man, assigned to a sphere equally important,  though not the same, the progress of the intellectual condi  lion of woman, during the three: last centuries, has been on  ward and upward. Her influence; has increased, in a direct  ratio, with her moral and intellectual culture, establishing the  fact, that, to her, as well as to man, " knowledge is power."  The references to history will be brief—as it is a fact, that  history, at best, is strikingly deficient in detecting the true  causes of great and prominent events. The sources of influence are often hidden, while the event stands in bold relief  on the historic page.    The ten years' war before; the walls of  icate  icr pros-  In the presence of woman, blasphemy is rebuked.    She is  tho sweet pleader for virtue—for religion—for the del  mill amiable courtesies and charities of life.    In  ence, the; cruel become humane; the audacious, meek; tho  proud, humble; and tho obstinate,yielding.  Yet, in the exercise of this widely felt, omnipotent influence, we cannot but feel, that, as each planet has its own orbit  in which it only can wheel its round, so has woman her orbit  and her peculiar sphere,—in which, as the loveliest gem on  the brow of night, the evening star, she may shine the brightest, as well as the mildest,—out of which she must be only u  wandering star " to which the mist of darkness is reserved  forever."  Admitting, as all reasonable beings must, the intellectual  equality of the sexes, it will not follow, of course, that there  is a physical equality—a parity of bone, and muscle, and  sinew, and nerve. When the notorious Frances Wright, the  renegade of her sox, made her daring attempt to disorganize  society, by reversing its customs; when her large, expressionless eyes looked out in the morning for the speculations  of tho day; when her brawny arms essayed to hold the  plough, guide the carriage, crack the whip,—while some  pale-faced, unsexed thing, once called a man, might have delicately made the tea, stitched the napkin, or plaited the ruflle;  when her voice was heard in halls and theatres, the brazenfaced advocate of infidelity, or dealing out the slangwhang of  politics and abolitionism,—she lost both the influence and the  sex of woman. Thenceforward, belonging- to neither sex,  she was a physical and moral monster of unknown gender—  like some huge, petrified megatherium,dug up from the monstrous relics of a world that perished in ihe wrath of the deluge. No wonder that this last experiment upon outraged  reason and propriety should have ended in "the laughter of  scorn nnd the jeers of the world." Well might the Wabash  rise in the strength of its autumnal power, and sweep, from  its polluted banks, the name and the last vestige of New Harmony !

Sully, that politic premier of France, well  knew the power of female influence, and retained in the patronage of government some of the most beautiful and accomplished of the sex, who were sent to foreign courts, as distinguished travellers, and sometimes even under the recommendation lo foreign sympathies of a mock banishment, for the  purpose of effecting changes in foreign policy favorable to  France. But this was generally done at the expense of that  jewel which shines the brightest in the female crown of moral beauty. In the task of enticing, by tho blandishments of  person and manner, the magnates of other lands, these female  plenipotentiaries bartered innocence, if they had any, for po-  itical eflect, and, like the silly insect that loves the taper,  were doomed to perish in the fires they kindled.

Tho Salic  law of France, by virtue of which males only can ascend the  throne, is good authority, coming as it does from that gallant  nation, in favor ofthe foregoing assertion. Indeed, when ihe supreme head ofthe Jewish theocracy, the creator of all worlds  mil the lawgiver of the universe, gave a reluctant consent,  mingled with warning, that his chosen people should have a  king to rule over them, like tho nations round about, he  spared woman from the unhappiness of wearing a crown.  Even the first Jewish king was a head and shoulders taller  than his brethren, as if physical superiority were essential to  kingship—more so, indeed, than the legitimate Stupidity descending in some royal families, which might havo been inherited from those animals, which it was the occupation of  Saul the son of Kish lo sock when they had strayed, anel herd  when he had found them. That same doctrine of legitimacy received a severe cheek by the sacred anointing of David  as Saul's successor, even in the life time of this hapny hunter of lost quadrupeds,* bul wretchedly unhappy king of Israel. No I Divine benevolence loved too well his " last  best gift to man" to assign, to her throbbing temples, a crown  —to eat, like a fiery girdle, into her overtasked and agonizing  brain; tho kindness of her heavenly Father was too great lo  give to woman, by command, the task of moving in the robes  of state through halls filled with hollow pretensions,  celt, envy, and every base passion that grows with monstrous  exuberance in the atmosphere of a court. For her is meet  the look of undisguised affection, the empire of the heart, the  quietness of her-sacred home—anil not the fierce and questionable passions of the Russian Catharine—tho sorrows of  the broken-hearted Mary, queen of Scots—or tho proud despair of the haughty, yet stricken Elizabeth!  V\ ere it not a subject too grave for ridicule, it would be  pleasant to carry out such a rcveision of the order of Nature,  as the filling of a throne with a female woman, into all the  concerns of life. The young and girlish Victoria is, by virtue of her throne, the head of the church, She is to make  and unmake, bishops. If females, then, arc greater than bishops, they should not only wear bishop's sleeves, but be bish  ops themselves; this is a logical conclusion which might be  carried out into the extremes of Fanny Wrightism—such as  making ladies swing the scythe and axe, while; gentlemen  threaded ihe needle, worked Iho muslin, and made lawn  wrappers,—if nol so far as to make the cart draw the horse,  and the boat propel the steam.  I have a single apology to make for not entering more  net" tin: detail of tin; elements of Female Influence. One  might as well analyze the sunlight; it is every where; not a  hamlet or a palace nn the round earth but is irradiated by female: influence. Like the atmosphere which girds the world,  the broad and ever-present subject repels me from its particulars, while I stand filled with admiration and awe in view of  its vnstness.  But, by no means, is the conclusion correct that there arc  no prominent anil public spheres of woman's usefulness. The  history of missions and of modern philanthropy abounds tfilh  instances of tho moral courage of females, exerted in the; eye.  of the great world, and amidst the roar of its applause. The  first female American missionary to foreign lands, the sainted  Harriet Newell, as she sleeps in her lonely grave in the Isle  of France, could not have had, as she died, the most distant  conception of the mighty emotion which rolled over the heart  of Christendom when she fell, provoking thousands to like  noble deeds of self-denial, anil moral daring. The beloved  names of tho wives of other American missionaries—a Jiul-  son, who braved the horrors of a Burmese prison, and stood  by the side of her husband, unappalled in the face of the tyrants and the armies of Hindostan—a Thompson, who clasped her infant to her bosom, while the cannon balls of the  Turks and their grape shot passed through and crumbled the  walls of the dwelling in which she: was sitting, in the midst  of tin' melancholy and trodden-down Jerusalem, thus carnim.'  hersedf a grave "hard by the tomb of David,"—rise before  the mind,—and others as numerous as arc the various wall,!  of Christian charity, in the bible, tract, and Sunday school  departments of the present day.  Yet, after all, wo conceive that the strongest fortress of female power is in the direct influence which woman exerts on  the male character. It was a shrewd remark, ascribed, by  some satirist, to a Roman emperor, that his little boy governed the world, for, says he, I govern the world, my wife governs me, and the little boy governs her,—therefore', he governs  the world. The balance of power preponderates ever on  the side of influence.  »•###■• »  There is one instance in which, as we conceive, full jus.  ticc has not been done to the character of an American female. She stood almost too near a transcendent and peerless  character, to have her own peculiar virtues attract the attention they deserve; it was the wife of Washington. The aid  she gave him in the formation of his sublime character can  never be fully revealed. Much has been ascribed to the  mother of Washington, yet we never could find good evidence that she did much more for her "good boy George,"  than Walter Scott said was alone necessary for the education of a boy until ho was ten or twelve years of age—learned him " to ride, swim, shoot and tell the truth." Indeed,  the various attempts to elevate the character of the mother of  Washington, so high above the common order of females,  sustained even by tlio genius of Mrs Sigourney and Mis.  Hale, would seem to be overstrained and high-wrought  When Lafayette made a pilgrimage to her residence, after  the revolutionary war, and was introduced to her in a corn  field, leaning on her hoe, her venerable brows overshadowed wilh an overseer's straw hat, the circumstance was trumpeted, through chivalrous France and tho world, as being after Ihe manner of the old Roman matrons. Wc should  have preferred that tho mother of our Washington had sustained the nobler character of a Virginian lady.  But the wife of Washington was a sweet, accomplished  being.

Wo take but a single revelation of this  '■ ., it js from the closing scone of Washington's life :  The wing of a winter's storm hung gloomily and heavily  Mount Vernon. Tho night winds moaned through the  (less branches in tones of sorrow. But tho picture, in the  ick room of the father of his country, catches the eye. II  had said that he was not afraid to die. His physician had  urncd away, in despair, to the fire. His wife was seated at  , , foot 0f the bed. His faithful secretary stood at his side.  Washington placed his finger upon his pulse; his countcn-  changed; his hand fell from his wrist. The now  widowed wife of Washington asked wilh a firm, collected  .. --e " is l'c Sone ■ " ^'n0 secretary, unable to speak  raised his hand in token that death had passed his shadow  „vpr that illustrious face. " ' Tis well," was the reply worthy ofthe wife of Washington—" 'lis well; all is over now ;  [shall soon follow him; I have no more trials to pass through.  What a sentiment! When other and common females would  have been overwhelmed in sorrow ; when the clouds of their  Slackest trial would have impended over them, like Egyptian  darkness, palpable to the touch, she could say—I have no  •tore trials lo pass through !  Sometimes, when the massive piles of feathery clouds,  that lie like the " islands of the blest" in the deep, rarial sea  above us, break away in a particular spot, disclosing, fnr up  into the deeps of heaven, the passionless blue, a patch of eternal sunshine ; and, gazing in ecstacy, wo imagine we see  farther and clearer into the upper world than we ever did  lefore,—so does this expression, at such a moment, enable us  losee far into the mind of the lady of AVashington I  Why were her trials over, just at that point where the  trials of many would havo just commenced ? I answer, because she was the guardian genius of her husband. Wrapped,  absorbed in, and identified with his fame, her trials were  over, and her ministry ended, tho very moment she surrendered him, pure, spotless, and safe into the bosom of his God I  Her soul had been with his in all his struggles; she had  visited him in every camp from Cambridge to Yorktown  She had kissed his cheek in that gloomy retreat through the  Jerseys, when he felt of his neck to see if he were born for a  traitor's halter; she had heard the bugles of France join  with the shrill clarions of her country, in a loud and startlin  song of victory, over ocean's queen, the conquerer of the  Armada. Well did she know the uncertainty of human  honors und worldly applause; and when she saw that majes  tic being whom she had loved anel cherished in life, whose  violent passions (for what great man has not such,) she had  calmed as oil thrown upon the seething billows ;—when she  saw him carried safely into the harbor of eternal repose, and  mvi the pale finger of death write immortality upon his  brow, well might she say—" my trials are all over." She  left, at that moment, her beloved reposing on his bed of glory.  Should we proceed further with this subject, we should  almost wish to make tho corollary the premise, and argue  'he importance of female education from the importance of  female influence.    The very fact, however, that the premise  and the corollary are convertible, proves that we have built,  however feebly, on the; foundation. With this our utmost  ambition is satisfied. There will be other builders. Mississippi, having put her hand to the cause of female education  will not look back. She will be as distinguished for female  accomplishment, rs for enterprise, patriotism and her high,  indomitable sense of honor. Others will tell of the sacred and  honorable vocations of a teacher,—whose it is to stand at the  fountain waters of this ocean of moral influence, evoking nnd  directing its earliest flow, in ten thousand rills, down the  sparkling sides of a thousand mountains, until, uniting in a  shoreless sea, it shall spread its bright cincture round tho  world, cheering and refreshing both the cottages of poverty  and the palaces of wealth.  SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  NATCHEZ,  MARCH 30,   1838.  Aokncy.—The Executive Committee of the Lyceum for  the publication of the Journal, have succeeded in securing  the services of Mr. John Ford Harper, of Washington,  in Adams county, as an agent to advance the interests and enlarge the subscription list of the South-Western Journal. As  this young gentleman possesses iho entire confidence of this  community, and of tho members of the Lyceum, we commend him to the attention of the friends of science and literature throughout the State.  There being two modes of advancing the interests of the  Journal—one, by becoming a stockholder and partner in the  profits, on the payment of t?25, annually for four years, and  the other by subscribing for the publication, and making advance payments,—we confidently hope that Mr. Harper, who  is fully authorized to receipt for stock, as well as subscription  payments, will be able most effectually to promote the interests  of literature in this State, by introducing, into hundreds of families, a native periodical, intended to be both the representative of Mississippi in the literary world, anel the foster patron  of her genius.  TO READERS AND CORRESPONDENTS.  The "Essay on the Yellow Fevers of Natchez," although  not quite concluded in the last number of the Journal, is not  continued in tho present number, but will be concluded in  some future one. The remainder consists of some historical  sketches of tho various Yellow Fever years in Natchez, confirmatory of the writer's theory, -which was concluded in the  last number.  In number IX, of the South-Western Journal, we hope to  find space for a Lecture on the " Influence of Poetry on National character," by C. L. Dubuisson, Esq.; and a "Sketch  of a Visit to India," by Dr. S. C. Merwin.  THE POWER OP THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.  No one, after reading the following, will doubt the power  of the English language to express the fury of a storm at  sea. It is from the pen of T. S.

'■ ■ti  'h it'.  luckily with all our sails close reefed, through a warm, but  gloomy rain, at nine knots. We were on the edge of the  Vcu'.f Stream, and took the full benefit of what the sailors  call the butt-end of a north-wester, The rise of this whirlwind was instantaneous. It had been blowing pretty still all  day, when, suddenly, I saw the fore and main topsails carried  away, and a wave burst inlo the round house, and rolled backward and forward, there leaving us all nearly knee-deep in  wafer. In an instant the wind was—not blowing—but bursting over the vessel, in a rapid series of explosions, each one  like water forced violently from tho spout of an engine. The  sea and air wero foam to the lop-mast. The ship lying over  low, her gunwale under water, her deck scattered with pieces  of broken bulwarks, and great fragments of sail, ropes, spars,  and entire blocks flying off and up upon the gale. The sounds  exceeded all I had ever imagined: a mingled and fierce crash:  thunder, whirl and tumult almost beyond conception. The  musls bent like willow wands. The noises resembled those  of some tremendous conflagration, ihe roar of broad flames,  nnd the crush of beams, roofs, walls, and timber. There is,  indeed, a similitude between the extreme fury of fire and water, when those elcmets attain mastery. Above our heads,  sails, blocks, and cables, loosened and rent, were hurled up  anel down again upon the roof of the round house. It is not  possible for ono unacquainted wilh the sea, to conceive fully  tho phenomena of such a scene. Tho wind is there a new  and appalling power, or rather a fiend omnipotent and infernal. It breaks in volumes and audible billows over your  head; producing sounds which seem like ihe conflict of unseen demons in the air. Each separate part of the rigging  in motion, the huge fabric!, strained to ils utmost tension;  ropes, waves, sails, spars, cables, chains, blocks, doors, beams,  instinct with the phrensyof nature. We were deafened with  the slamming, banging, crackling, crashing-, snapping, splitting, flouting, roaring, thundering. It seemed impossible  that such fearful noises could be produced, except from the  cruching to pieces of planks and timber. Each moment, as  I turned my eyes from the masts, I thought I heard them go,  anil could scarcely credit my sight that they were not yet  gone. The prominent f'eatuic of this hour is the noises. In  addition to the full thunder of the sea and wind, a thousand  whips cracking, a thousand doors banging, a thousand planks  splitting—all together—all with the most incessant, phrensied  intense violence and rapidity. It was a madness, a delirium  of the elements, a paroxysm, an ecslasy of rage and ruin.  Tho philological editor of tho New Yorker thus addresses  tho American Johnson, the king of lexicography:  LETTER TO DR. WEBSTER.  New York, Dec. 23,  1837.  Noah  Webster, LL. D.  Hear Sir—1 have resolved lo trouble you with a few casual suggestions respecting the Etymology of our language, in  connexion with your Dictionary. My course hitheito, as a  general and public defender of your views in opposition to  those of Johnson and Richardson, will, I liust, excuse the liberty. Bear with me, then, while I suggest a few instances  in which I am compelled to depart from your standard.    If  lyou think it worth the trouble to enlighten mc on tli,.,,,  'points, you will do .so; if not, it matters little. Here are my  cavils:  1. Judgement one) its derivatives, yen spell without the  middle c, and also abridgement, acknowledgement,and other  words of this class. Why so? Many of them you derive  from the French, where the e appears. As the sole use ol  the e is lo soften the g preceding it, I see not why it may not  be us properly omitted in judge as in judgement.  V. Wo, you spell indifferently with and without an e. [  hold tho c superfluous and very unsightly. The word looks  to me just as go and no would to you, if spelled goc and not.  But, more than this, yon give us woesome (with the e) and  leoful (without it,) and use the latter to define the former.  How can (his be justified ?  3. Acre you spell correctly, yet give us theater and kindred abominations. As you frace this word to the French  theatre, and as its derivatives nre; theatric, theatrical, &c, I  think your innovation on the established usage unwarrantable.  4. Bituminous, &c, from bitumen, do not suit me. I know  others nre with you in, this instance, but that does not satisfy  me.  5. Waggon 1 want with two gs, in accordance with the  analogy of our language, just as in cragged, dogged, lugger,  baggage, &c. Can't you help mc to a reason ? The derivation is nol sufficient, as our language oflen doubles consonants after short vowels, in spite of the primitive I know-  there is flagon in the way; but that is not one of our rugged  northern barbarisms, but (as you have it) an irregular offshoot  of Lantinity. But I would gladly writeflaggon forthesake  of waggon. I will give up the point if you say I must, but  I hate lo do it.  G. Launch is the good old way; and you restrict us to  lanch without u reason except the derivation, which looks  questionable. (1 would take your word for it sooner than  any other man's; but Lexicographers have so demolished  each other's characters in this matter of deriving words from  other languages, that I trust implicity to none.) Beside, the  derivation is not conclusive. You give us laundress from  lavandicrc and laundry from lavade.ro. 1 think I must Still  write launch, staunch, &c.  7. Traveler looks horribly, but 1 am coming to it by degrees. You are probably right in this instance—(I mean  your principle; is a sound one)—but to follow you goes against  tho grain.  Enough for your patience. Perhaps all my difficulties  arc solved by your Quarto; but how shall a poor Editor indulge in such luxuries? This brings me to the point on  which I was first impelled lo address you. Several persons  around mc in the common walks of life, say they would contrive to purchase your Quarto if your publishers would but  issue an edition in numbers (like Richardson's) at a moderate  price and at intervals—bi-mothly, for instance. How does  the suggestion strike you ? I am sure many would subscribe  to it, and much good result from the undertaking.  Yours truly, HORACE GREELEY.

The Morristown Jersey-man states that Professor Morse  aided by the ingenuity ol Mr, Alfred Vail, has succeeded  in his important experiments to convey intelligence by elec  tricity.  The Telegraph consists of four parts:  1st. The Battery—A Cruikshank's Galvanic Trough of  sixty pairs of plate, seven by eigln and a half inches each.  'il. The Portrulc—An instrument which regulates the  motion of the rule. The rule answers to the slick of the  printers, and in it the type, representing the numbers to be  transmitted, are passed beneath the lever which closes nnd  breaks the circuit.  3d, The Register—An instrument which receives and re  eords the numbers sent by tho Portrulc from any distant sta  lion.  'lib- A Dictionary—Containing a complete vocabulary of  "ll the words in the English language, regularly numbered.  The words of the sentenco " Railroad cars just arrived,  345 passengers." wero put into numbers from the dictionary;  the numbers were set up in the telegraphic type about as soon  83 the same matter would have been in a printing office, ajid  passed, complete by the Portrulc, in about half a minute, each  "roke ofthe Portrule, at one extremity, marking on the regis  ter at the other, a distance of two miles, instantaneously.  The spark at one end, and the stroke ofthe pencil at the other,  were simultaneous. "On Wednesday evening," says the  editor of the New York Observer, " we saw the experiment  performed at the University, with ten miles of wire. It was  completely successful." Whether it will prove equally successful for very great distances, is yet to be tried. The "editor  of the Observer says :  " This invention has two advantages over all other plans  for an electro-magnetic telegraph yet proposed. It uses but  one wire in conveying intelligence. It records, legibly, the  intelligence conveyed. Both these advantages seem (o us  important."  Arcs of Ellipses or Circles.—Professor Muiler, of  Berlin, has, in a late course of Lectures, offered a simple and  mechanical explanation of the universal admiration bestowed  on these curves. The eye, he observes, is moved in its socket by six muscles, of which four are respectively employed  to raise, depress, turn to the right and to the left. The other  two have an action contrary to one another, and roll the eye.  on ils axis, or from the outside downward, anel inside upward.  On an object being presented to the eye for inspection, the first  act is that of circumvision, or going round the boundary lines,  so ns to bring consecutively every individual portion of tho  circumference upon the most delicate and sensitive portion of  the retina. Now, if figures bounded by straight lines, be  presented for inspection, it is obvious that but two of these  muscles can be called into action, and it is equally obvious,  that in curves of a circle or ellipse, all must alternately be  brought into action. The effect then is, that if only one be  employed, as in rectilinear figures, those two have an undue  share of labor: and by repeating the experiment frequently,  as wcelo in childhood, the notion of tedium is instilled, and  we form gradually a distaste for straight lines, and arc led to  prefer those curves which supply a more general and equable  share of work to the muscles.—New York Obs  The Great AuntinoN.—Truly great in every sense of  the word! He has devoted the bost portion of his life upon  that herculean and magnificent work, "The Birds of America!' which will be, whe-n finished, a proud and enduring  monument lo his fame; the almost discouraging circumstan-  es under which he began it, his untiring industry and smell  reward, present him to our claims under a peculiar aspect.  Sixteen years was the time proposed to complete it in, when  the first number was issued ; a period which, in itself, it would  seem was alone enough to discourage both author and  patron—but with less than two hundred actual subscribers he  persevered against every obstacle. Twelve years have  already elapsed since he commenced, and he has recently  announced that he confidently anticipates to finish the last  number during the present year. What a vacuum it must  leave when the noble and exalted labor of so many years is  at an end ! But such a genius can never rest—the spirit is  always struggling to tower—to aspire beyond the every day  realities of life—and it is well that it should so aspire—it is  one of the sweetest passages in our existence—it is ono ofthe 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/503	503	504.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/504.jp2

Geological Survey  of Louisiana We learn that  a talented and influential member of the Legislature of Lou  isiana (Mr. Penn,) has introduced a bill into the legislature  of that slate, authorizing a geological survey. This state is  already known to be rich in iron ore, particularly the valley  of the Ouachita; lead has been dug from the Tunica hills,  gypsum of a superior quality has been found upon Thompson's creek; and that part of the state lying north of Lake  Ponlchartrain, in many of its districts, is rich in beds of mar  and, we believe, small quantities of silver ore have also been  found there. Strong probabilities exist, that the extensive  prairies in the south-western part of the slate contain valuable  beds of coal.  Natural Coke.—A bed of natural coke, seventeen feel  in thickness, has been discovered near Richmond, Va., below  a bed of iron ore.  THE MONTHLY MEETING OF THE LYCEUM.

W.MONKTTti, M, D.  CONCLUDED.  The Epidemic of  1S23.—This was probably the most  extensive and terrific epidemic yellow fever which has visited  this or any other city of its population.    It commenced in  scattering cases in the south-western part of tho city on both  sides of a largo gully or ravine, which heads on Ihe northwest side of the town, and also in the vicinity of other bayoux of the same hind, which extend up'to the block of the  city at several points on the south side.    During the prevalence of the epidemic,  those sites, near thoso bayoux and in  the declivity towards them,  from  the adjacent  bills, were  ihe chief seats of  the disease; although it finally extended over a large portion  of the   city.     It was about two  weeks niter tho epidemic appeared, " on the hill," before it ex-  tended to that portion " under the hill,   at the landing.  |Med.  Record, vol. 4, p. 0-8.)    The first cases which excited alarm,  occurred between the 9th and   12th of August.    About th  20ib, it become so alarming, that the Board of Health, after  receiving the reports of the medical faculty, declared the ex  istehce of yellow fever in tho city as an epidemic.   The mass  of citizens immediately fled, with their necessary moveables,  as before an invading army.    They crowded into Washing-  Ion, and dispersed by hundreds through the country; many  of them remaining in temporary shelters and camps.   Many  fled across the Mississippi, into the alluvial lands of Loilisia-  NO. It).  closed, and in tho beds, which had nol been ej  frosts.  osrd to ths  On the 10th of September, after the epidemic had prevailed about three weeks, the equinoctial gales .sprung up, and  continued for two days, with such violence as to cause much  damage among the shipping at New Orleans, as well as  along the coast, and in the Gulf of Mexico. In the region  of Natchez, it was so severe, that tho standing corn and the  cotton crops were leveled and much injured. This wind  ippeared to have swept off all the out-door infection; und, for  several days, tho disease appeared to have been aircsted.  But, after a week ol warm weather, it broke forth with renewed violence; and was finally checked only by the cold weather and frosts in the last of October and in the first week of  November.  The state of the weather immediately preceding this epidemic was excessively oppressive. The month of July had  been agreeably diversified with sunshine anil showers of rain.  August was hot and sultry, with occasional showers, followed,  us Dr. Curtwright observes, "several hours at a time, by a  breathless state of the atmosphere."  New Orleans, this summer, was not unusually sickly, until the first of August, although some cases of yellow fever  bad previously occurred. About the middle of August,  cases multiplied rapidly, and that city suffered severely for  two months.  At Mardez's, one mile from Washington, on the Natchez  road, several houses and several temporary bills and sheds,  The disease continued to prevail in the city, from t  20th of August, until  it was checked by tho cold weather of about sixty persons of the common people, w  near the last of October,    During this time', few who visited thither.    Their apartments were small, close, nr.  •&gt;■ were crowded with families and  individuals, to the number  o had fled  ill venti-  llie infected district from the country escaped the discs:  Notwithstanding the number of persons and families, as well  us the large quantities of goods, &c, carried to Washington,  there was no case of yellow fever contracted in Washington,  although there were about ten deaths in the town, besides recoveries, of persons who had contracted the disease in Natchez.  On the 15th of September, a census ol the city was taken,  by which it was ascertained that there were within the limits  ol the city, seven hundred and eighty-four souls. On the  Wtb of September,  the official report gave the number of  luted. Several persons died at this place within u week after  they arrived from Natchez. About two weeks after their arrival, tho yellow fever broke out most malignantly among  them, and about twenty of the whole number died. An infected air was generated, and several persons from Iho vicinity contrac.cd the disease by visiting thnt place. Nearly all  the persons from the country who contracted tho disease, by  visiting Coonville, as the place is culled, died of the most malignant symptoms. Among these were Messrs. Glasscock,  Thompson, Norman, and others. The infection in these  sheds and houses was doubtless as coiicenlrrted as that in tho  deaths at two hundred and six, from August 21st to Septem-lcily.  oer 19th, inclusive.    From the commencement to the closel    Several cases occurred, in like manner, nt Haughton's tav  01 the pestilence, the whole number ol deaths within the city,  Was about three hundred and twenty. Nearly twenty person;  'lied in iho city late in October, and during the first two  weeks of November, by returning to their houses and beds,  titer they had supposed the infection destroyed by frost.—  Some of these deaths occurred as late as the 15th of Novem-  W. Although the frosts had destroyed the out-door infec-  '■on, still it was virulent in  the houses, which had   been  em, ono mile from Natchez, and situated near the margin of  the main trunk of all the bayoux or ravines which head  around the city. Many of the cases at Haughton's were supposed to have had no intercourse with the infected district.  As to the causes of this epidemic, there are various opinions. Dr. Cartwright, in a very able and lengthy essay,  ascribes it lo the combined operation of a lot of putrid bacori  in the Southwest part of the city, putrid oysters, and  putrid   =^i  ■ •■ %.»!  ■''4?  m  :.;:; :!:j  • If." *  i i- ill  TV,  • if.'

We believe il is a miasm which accumulates in these ravines, until they are full to overflowing,  and in the declivities towards their brinks; and that gentle  winds waft it over lo situations which would otherwise be  healthy.  IV. The Epidemic of 182") commenced " under the  hill," by a few very malignant cases in and near a certain  warehouse at the'landing. The first cases occurred about  the 20th of August: and nearly all of them were carried up  into thexity after they were attacked, where they died. Several deaths had thus occurred in the upper city, as well as in  the lower, previous to the 29th of August, when tho Board  of Health, upon the reports ofthe Medical faculty, announced  the existence of yellow fever as an epidemic, and advised the  citizens to disperse; notwithstanding most of the cases were  ascribed to intercourse with the infected district under the  hill. A great portion of the citizens fled to Washington and  the surrounding country; anel for nearly three weeks, but  few cases occurred in the upper city, although now cases di:  ly appeared near the landing.! About the 20th and 22d of  September, after ihe yellow fever hud made its appearance at  Washington, most of the refugees returned to the city, believing the epidemic to have subsided. After their return,  the population ol Natchez amounted to nearly fifteen hundred  souls, during the remainder of September and all October.  About the last of September, soon after ihe return of those  from Washington, the disease began again to prevail in the  upper city with great malignity; and continued its ravage's  until checked by frost nnd cold weather about the 28th o|  October. As the cold weather and winds appeared to have-  put a stop to the disease, llic inhabitants returned from the  having contracted the infection before they retired. Sevelii]  cases occurred likewise at Houghton's, one mile south-fast of  Natchez, near the junction of the two main branches of thc  bayou.  The spring of 1825 was not uncommon in any respect,  During the months of June and July, the weather was agree.  ably diversified with fair weather and wilh showers. Jtily  towards the latter part, was, however, rather dry; August  and September were quite dry, and vegetation began to lan.  guish for want of duo moisture. The temperature of July  and August averaged "il" at 5 o'clock, A. M., and 91° nt -I  o'clock, P. M. The temperature of September averaged  only 72° at 5 A. M.,nnd $5,&lt;Q at 4, P. M.: although, during  the first twenty-two days of that month, the thermometer was  often up to 91° nnd 93* Fahrenheit, as tho extreme heat, and  the air often very sultry. During the first ten (lays of October, the mercury was often up to 87°, 90°, and 91°, ns extreme heat.  The infected district on the hill, was in the south-west and  the south-east pails of the city, to which the generality of  cases were confined. Dr. Cartwright informs us, that while  the yellow fever was raging in I his part of the cilv, the  northern portion of it was free from yellow fever, anil exhibited only a few cases of common bilious fever.  The yellow fever of Natchez in 1825, has been ascribed  to "spoiled porter," and "sour pork," and "putrid fish, and  putrid sour croul," in a certain warehouse at the landing:  also to "a sunken flat-boat containing a quantity of rotten  corn," and to other vegetable and animal matters in a putrid  condition, in the mini anel stagnant water near the wlinrf, and  in the cellar of ihe aforesaid warehouse. [Med. Record,  vol. ix., p. 220', etc.| In the upper city, it was ascribed lo  "cily filth in the sewers, alleys, arid back-yards," which wis  suffered to accumulate, in the city, after the disease first made  its appearance at the landing.    [ Ibid p. 240.]  Dr. Morrill * ascribed it lo loose earth, thrown up nnd exposed to the sun, in digging down and filling ihe uneven  streets in the upper city, and in making an embankment for  country about the first of November, about which time it had a wharf at the landing.    Others have assigned other causes,  M    &gt;  been so cold as to freeze water. It was, however, not more  than four or five days after their return, when new cases began to occur among those who had returned ; and ten or  twelve deaths took place between the 5th and 18th of November, exclusively among those who had been absent during the month of October. The infection, no doubt, was destroyed in those houses which had been open and exposed to  ventilation, as well as in the general atmosphere of the city:  but in those houses which had been closed for several weeks,  it was as virulent as at any lime during the epidemic. Had  those houses'beer. opened and ventilated for a few days during  the cold winds and frosts, no danger would have ensued from  entering them.  The whole number of deaths during the epidemic of 1825,  in Natchez and its vicinity, from the 20th of August to the  18th of November, was about one hundred and fifty; of whom  several died in the country after they had fled from the city,  'Med Record, vol. Ix, p. 5, C, 7, Ax.  tVlrieMed R,tr . vnl.ix, p.^f,, Sit  but in nothing different from the assigned causes of former  epidemics.  As we believe that the causes which have been alleged as  the sources of yellow fever miasm or infection, arc insufficient for the production of the epidemics of Natchez, we will  briefly state our reasons for entertaining a different opinion  from those above cited. Wo believe that the cause, or esscniiitl  agent of yellow fever miasm, is beyond our control, and our  only safety is to mitigale ils effects, observe ils approach, and  flee from it. We fear tho public attention and our city authorities have been too much drawn to matters which havo  no agency in the production of yellow fevers; or at most only a subordinate and contingent agency. As a necessary  consequence, they have entertained a fallacious hope that security would result from the removal in time of such causes  as were supposed to generate the pestilential miasm. They  have thus been lured into a false security, which has often  resulted in their disappointment.

S 0 U T H -WES T E U N  J 0 U R N A I,.  ,it,0ry to sustain; our views are such as are the result of an  iinpicjttdiccd inquiry into the different circumstances of the  iiin'ti V epidemics which have occurred in various cities ofthe  rjnjted States and of other countries. If the alleged causes  urenot tho true source of the disease, wo shall at least prevent a false security being placed in such means as really afford no safety; while we urge the necessity of speedy flight  upon tho first appearance of the pestilence. If it can thus bo  avoided, that fact alone will in some degree disarm it of ils  terrors.  We contend that yellow fever, as an epidemic, is not dependent for its production upon animal or vegetable putrefaction, or upon the union of bolh ; and that when these mat-  tors have been observed to precede an epidemic, it was only  a contingent, and not essential circumstance.    My views on  this subject are ably expressed by Dr. Cartwright, in his essays on the " Malignant fevers of Natchez."    After alluding  to "some of the circumstances which are necessary for the  production of yellow fever," he observes, "although yellow  lever may not occur any two years in succession, yet the effluvia to which it is erroneously attributed, may exist every  year in an equal degree.     Effluvia, as mere effluvia, are  innoxious, and should  not bo confounded with miasm, which  is the real cause of yellow fever.    We all know, that when  yellow fever has become epidemic in a cily,  it continues to  prevail until it is checked by frost, in defiance of all precautions which can be taken to arrest its progress.    All the ma  torials which are in a state of putrefaction, may be removed;  the air, before moist, may become diy; the evaporating process may be suspended ; and the mercury may fall  30° or  40° below the point at which  it stood when the disease first  appeared; yet it will continue to prevail after every one of  its supposed causes have been removed.     *    *    *    If effluvia produce it; if evaporation or moisture produce it; or if  all these combined produce it; what should give rise to tho  disease when  each and every one of those supposed causes  are removed ?"    [ Med. Recorder, vol. x., p. 229, 230.    We  answer, nothing but a subtle,   invisible, and  imperceptible:  miasm, which is produced independently of all such circumstances.    Some have supposed that a peculiar miasm is gen  orated during the putrefactive process, but not necessarily  firtid.    In our opinion, neither foetor nor putrefaction are at  nil concerned in its production : for we have shown that not  even the putrefiablc materials arc necessary.    The advocates  of uiiiinnl putrefaction admit thai the epidemic of 1825, "on  the hill," was produced without putrid animal matters of any  bind; and no one pretends to ascribe the epidemics of 1829  »nd 1837 to such causes.    These two epidemics are ascribed  lo city filth, to filthy and wet sewers and back yards; the  same causes which were said to have produced the fever of  1825, on the hill ; causes which were not called into requisition at all in 1823, although the most extensive and fatal  epidemic which has yet visited the city.    According to the  theories heretofore advanced, no two epidemics have ever  Men produced by the same cause : and upon the same principle, every succeeding epidemic, if we should be so unfortunate as to have others, will depend upon a new cause.    The  inference is, clearly, that the causes of yellow fever aro innu-  e leave our readers to determine whether tho  premises are tenable.  But we havo testimony incontrovertible that city filth is  not necessary to its production; nor is it at any time on auxiliary cause; us the disease prevails generally when there is  least of this existing; nnd often where it is most abundant,  there is no yellow fever produced. Dr. Rush1" even declares'  that the city filth in the sewers, alleys, and streets of Phila-  dolphin, appeared to absorb the pestilential miasm, and thus  to produce a partial protection against it. He declares that  luring the memorable epidemic of 1793, in that city, scavengers seemed especially exempt from its effects; as enly ono  out of forty was attacked with yellow fever. This is confirmed by the experience of Dr. Tilton.f He states that it  is injurious to remove city filth during an epidemic, ns the  filth seems to absorb the miasm, while the exposed pavements  from which it is removed augment the reflection of the solar rays, and increase the miasm. On the same principle, it  is believed by some, that fresh earth, strewed over the streets,  might be beneficial lo a certain extent. A mass of authority  might be adduced, to show that common city filth or offal  is not a cause or source of pestilential diseases. Natchez  is not more filthy than hundreds of other cities where no yellow fever exists. If city filth wero a cause, we know not  how it could ever occur in the cleanly and scattered village  of Washington.  We cannot believe that the removal and exposure of fresh  earth in digging down the streets and filling up low grounds,  are essential or even auxiliary to the generation of yellow  fever miasm.    More or less of this has been done in  Natchez every year; yet, for the last six years previous to 1837,  there has been no epidemic yellow fever in the city.   And,  again, we know that yellow fever prevails much more frequently, and  more extensively, in New Orleans and  other  cities, where no such digging is done', or is even practicable,  Extensive excavations and embankments have been carried  on in different parts of this State,  (luring the last year; yet  in no case has yellow fever been generated  from it.    One  rail-road enters Natchez by a deep cut of fifteen or twenty  feet; yet that was the most healthy part of the cily during  the last epidemic.    The same road passes through Washington, with a cut ten feet deep in the cenlre of the town; and  within one hundred yards are extensive embankments, besides two hundred yards of the main street, which was filled  up to the depth of about two feet, and two largo lots of one  hundred and fifty feet square, which were dug down on one  side and filled up on  the other, to the depth of six or eight  feet: yet the health of Washington never was better than  during the existence of iho epidemic of 1837 in Natchez,  rhesame embankments and excavations extend twenty miles  beyond Washington, through some of the largest plantations,  yet not a single case of yellow fever has been produced by  them.    Tho same is true of tho rail-roads from Grand Gulf,  Vicksburg, and other  points.    Again, within the last two  years, extensive embankments of alluvial earth and vegetable matters, have been made along ihe lower Mississippi, to  t Med. Repos. v. ID.,11.184.  ' Med. liieruirlH, vol.

Yet  in no instance hive: they produced yellow fever among those  who were engaged in the work, or in others; although the  laborers, in many instances, were unucclimtited Irishmen and  Germans, who would be most liable to the disease.  On the other hand, some medical men of eminence have  becoino satisfied that fresh exposed earth is decidedly healthy,  and is in some degree a protection from infectious diseases.  In addition to the facts stated by Dr. Rush, it is the opinion  of Dr. Tilion," before cited, that the infection in a city might  be arrested in some degree, by covering the streets freely  with fresh dug earth, by which the miasm might be absorbed, or neutralized, Ho says, that persons fleeing from yel  low fever, as well as those laboring tinder it, are less apt to  carry with them imd accumulate an infecting air. in tents and  open grounds, than in wooden houses with plunk floors; and  that diit floors in wooden houses arc preferable to plank.  He gives this opinion as the result of extensive observation.  He thinks that pure: eurtl) is the best purifier of infectious  clothing, and articles of any kind, as has been frequently experienced from burying such articles for a short time in the  ground.  As wo conceive the epidemic yellow fever of Washington  in 1825, to be n branch of the Natchez epidemics, we will  is history and origin. It may bo proper to  hington is an inland town, six miles east of  rolling; or undulating lands, about fifty feet  lite of the city. It is a village thinly scat-  tccts, of which the middle one is a mile in  width of the town is nearly half a mile.  give a sketch of i  premise, that Wc;  Natchez, on high,  higher than the :  tend over throi si  length; the entire  It is remote from any marsh or stagnant water; only a small  branch of running water passes within a quarter ol a mile  of the Main street, The population, previous to the epidemic  of 1825, Mas about four hundred whiles, and about one hundred blacks. Tho bouses arc mostly detached, surrounded  with open grounds and commons, and finely shaded by the  "Pride of China." During the first fifteen days of September,  1S23. while the town was crowded with the people and goods  from Natchez, ihe population must have been nearly double  the ordinarj number, or about eight hundred or one thousand  souls, besides the unusual number from the country, whoso  business was done altogether in Washington. For this pur-  pose, large quantities of dry goods, blankets, &c, were carried out for ihe loll-mid winter use of the planters; besides the  beds, bedding, &c, taken out by aboul forty families,! who  were crowded into every vacant apartment that could be procured in private houses; and often temporary partitions were  erected to make separate apartments of one room. -Several families kept boarding houses, which were crowded by  clerks and young men from Natchez. The town has no  large manufactories of any kind, whore animal or vegetable  accumulations could take place, nor are the houses crowded  together, so as to accumulate the materials of common citv  filth.  Previously to the. present epidemic, Washington had been  • Med.-Repos1, 111., p isa to 131,  ' Med. Kecurd, v x., p. ss?.$  noted as a healthy retreat from the yellow fevers of Naithtz  and that disease never spread among the citizens before- ai.'  though there hud previously been numerous cases and death,  from yellow fever brought from Natchez. High grades of  fever have and do still occasionally appear in the village during the mouths of August and September, but nothing li]  yellow fever, unless it has been contracted in Natchez: nor  hns the number ofensos previously introduced from Natchez  ever infected the air of ihe village. It is but justice testate  that Dr. Branch, one of the oldest practitioners in the com,,  ty, declares that in the fall of 1821 there were a nnmber of  sporadic, cases of yellow fever in Washington, although there  was no epidemic in Natchez at that time. Thoso cases lelid  not witness, but I have occasionally, within the last fifteen  years, seen sporadic, case's of yellow lever in the vicinity, when  no epidemic prevailed in Natchez: bin they were always the  cffecls-of extraordinary fatigue or exposure lo ihe sun at that  season, or of being (or .several hours among tho boats ai the  Natchez landing in tho hot sun. During the first two weeks  of September, 1825, there was no violent grade of fever  in the; town, until it broke out as yellow fever about the  15th.  Such was the condition of the place, win n the yellow ftier  in Natchez, caused the citizens to seek refuge in Washington and the surrounding country, On the 1st and 2d dnysof  September, the latter place became crowded wilh ihe people  and goods from Natchez. During the first ten days of September, there were about ten cases of yellow fever in Wash  ington, and several deaths ; all of which were unequivocally  traced to Natchez as tho source of .their infection. During  this time, there were also fresh supplies of goods brought  out, and it free intercourse kept up with the city by ibose who  affected not to fear the disease. On the loth of September  the first case of the Washington fever occurred, and five days  afterwards the disease was considered epidemic; when ihe  greater part of tho proper inhabitants, as well as those frcm  Natchez, deserted and fled to the country; but many of those  from Natchez returned to the city, believing the epidemic  there bad subsided. In the first out-breaking ef the Washington fever, the inhabitants of Natchez wore much less liable in it than those of Washington. The disease prevailed  with great malignity among the citizens of Washington who  could not leave, as will as among those who contracted the  disease before they left the town, until ihe change of wealhcr  and frosts about the 28th of October. After this change,  there were no now cases in Washington, until after the return  of the inhabitants during the first week of November. Between the 1st nnd 10th of this month, about ten cases occurred, and only in those who returned to town after nn absence  of five or six n eeks, Of these ten cases, five proved falal en  the fifth and eighth days.  The whole number of deaths by the Washington fever,  from the 18th of September to the 12ih of November, was  about sixty ; and the whole number of cases were about one  hundred and twenty-five. Out of the proper inhabitants of  Washington, about forty died.  To many, the cause of epidemic yellow fever in such a  clean, healthy village as Washington, is unaccountable.

Others believe a more rational mode of accounting for it may  be riven by supposing the general atmosphere was highly  excitable by the accumulation of miasm during the previous  hot weather, and which became contaminated to a certain decree, so as to form malaria during the sultry weather of Sep.  lember previous to the 15th ; end that in this state it formed a  proper "nidus'' for tho spread of infected air, oryellow fever  infection: thnt this infected air was carried out in large quantities in the goods, blankets, &c, as well as new sources in  ibe beds and bedding, which were distributed in almost every  house: that the crowded population, during hot, calm, sultry  weather further contaminated the air, and the cases of yellow  lever taken lo the town, also gave out their infectious exhalations, in n suitable atmosphere: ihat, under these circum-  [Botes, the "leaven" introduced expedited the process, which  otherwise might have been indefinitely postponed.  It is unnecessary to inquire into all the contradictory statements which have been made in relation to the putrid bacon  alleged. Wc doubt not they who gave the information contained in the Medical Recorder, were mistaken as to fads. It  was my fortune, previous to the outbreaking of the epidemic,  to have occupied and slept in an office only three doors from  said grocery, which I passed often every day, yet 1 never jier-  ceived any indication of putrid animal matters: and it is* probable that '.he bacon was not so completely putrid as to destroy  its sale. But we havo shown that putrid animal matters do  nol produce yellow fever, oven had they been present in this  case. It might moreover be shown, ihat among the first and  mosttlialignant cases were these who lived most remote from  the grocery, or infected district; who had not visited the grocery at all; some of them being ladies: that there was really  in this case no "infected district," but the whole lown was one  entire infected district. The ravine near the grocery is only  a gentle declivity, in which the rain water collects, and passes off down a deep ravine, or bayou as they are often called,  which begins about one hundred and twenty yards north-east  ofthe grocery. Accumulations of any thing like city filth  is absolutely out of the question.  The inquiry might bo mad", why the yellow fever was not  tarried from Natchez to Washington in 1823? To which 1  Would reply, that in 1823 there More fewer porous woolen  goods taken out than in 1825; and in 1823 they were not so  much crowded. Besides, in 1823, about the 10th of September, a very severe gale sprung up, and continued as an equi-  noctial, for two days, with rain, thunder, &c.j but in 1825 the  Irst two weeks of September were warm, calm, and sultry,  Thus in 1823 the miasm was wafted away, and the formation  malaria prevented; hence the infection of yellow fever did  n(" spread.  As to the cases which occurred at Haughton's, one mile  'wm Natchez, we think it more plausible to suppose Ihe miasm which was gene-rated and accumulated in the bayoux,  settled along down them, until they reached the junction, near  'Med. Record.,v.In.,p.846,4c.  of  Haughton's house: where also the banks overflow with the  miasm, or malaria, and thus produce yellow fever in those  who resided there, even if wo believe they had never been in  Natchez. This we think more likely, than that the putrid  animal and vegetable matters, collected info the bayoux near  Natchez, should remain there perfectly innoxious, until rains  should wash it down to Haughton's, where it would first commence to extricate the malaria or gas.  During the years 1826, '7, and '8, there was no epidemic  yellow fever in Natchez. However a few sporadic cases were  seen each year, and especially in 1827, whin a number of  cases were known to exist, so as lo cause alarm in some who  fled to the country. There were about fifteen deaths in Nat-  chezand vicinity, from yellow fever in 1827, seme of which  were traced to New Orleans for their origin,  V. The Epidemic of 1829. This was the mildest  epidemic of the kind which has prevailed in Natchez. The  summer of 1829 was generally healthy, until about the last  of August and the first of September, when some cases in  Natchez began to assume malignant symptoms. Several  deaths by malignant fever occurred in the city, as well as nt  the landing, between the first and sixth of September. On  the 8th of September, considerable alarm, prevailed in the  city, and tho Board of Health, after receiving the reports of  the medical faculty, advised the citizens to disperse. The  reports of the physicians showed that there were then abcut  twenty cases of malignant fever under treatment in ihe upper  ilyund at the binding. The majority of the citizens immediately retired to the country and to Washington. The disease continued lo prevail moderately among those who re-  mainid until about the last of October; a few cases occurred  in those who returned into closed houses, as late ns the 8th  anel 10th of November. During ibis epidemic, the whole  number of deaths in the city, by yellow fever, did nol exceed  eighty-five or hint ty. The whole number of cases was probably near th rce hundred ; although many of them were mild,  and assumed the character of high grades of bilious fever,  attended with profuse discharge-of yellow bile.  The summer was rather wet, until the latter part of August: in September there was less rain ; the heat was often  oppressive, and the air sultry. No unusual form of disease  prevailed in the country; but ibc health ef the country generally was as good as common at those seasons.  This year the yellow fever did not prevail much in New  Orleans, until the 24lh of August; and it /list appeared in  Mobile about the 20th of September.  So far as I have been able to learn, all seem at a loss to ascribe this epidemic to any adequate cause. .Some, however,  seem inclined to ascribe it to the old, exploded one; viz: exhalations from earth recently exposed by digging down and  leveling the uneven surface of the city. Doubtless the same  general causes which produced the other epidemics of Natchez in other years, produced this, independently of any local  accumulations of filth or putrefiable matters: and of the removal of earth in leveling the streels of ihe city.  From 1829 to 183V, there was no epidemic yellow fever in  Natchez; although a'lew sporadic cases were seen occasionally under peculiar exciting causes; und frequent cases were  : i;'.'»'"V  t ',,.'■ I;  '. lr&gt;jk  •■/'■■ii  m  ' .!'■•; i  ■Wm  i ;.■ ), I  ... ■ .ijr. i  "V  I I  m   :    i  		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/510	510	511.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/511.jp2

The Epidemic of 1337, began by a lew sporadic  cases about the 8th and Oth of September, and became epidemic about the 15th.    Yet the cases were not numerous or  very malignant until about the middle of October.    In the  first ten or fifteen days of iis prevalence, many cases were  mild or so modified as  to create doubts in minds of many  whether the disease- were really malignant yellow fever. D  ring this time, if efficient means hud been taken to cause the  population to disperse, and desert the city, we doubt not the  pestilence might have been stayed: but it was not until near  the 25th of September, that the Board of Health or the city  authorities, could determine, from the opinions of the medical  faculty, as to the actual danger which the citizens would en  counter by remaining in the city.    For want of timely no  tice of the danger, tho dispersion was gradual and slow, even  until the middle of October.    The disease continued to prevail, with occasional abatements, until tho 25th of November;  although the prevalence of the disease was much checked by  Iho cold winds and frosts which occurred early in November,  During the prevalence of the (lis -ase, from the 8th of September to the 25lh of November, when the last death occurred, the whole number of deaths, of all  diseases, was about  two hundred and eighty, within the city and at the hospital.  Several of those at the hospital, were patients landed from  steamboats direct from New Orleans.    Besides those, there  were ten or fifteen who died at different places in the country, whither they had retired, after having imbibed the seeds  of the disease in  Natchez.    So that the entire number of  deaths from this epidemic, might be near three hundred.    In tl  tho early period of the epidemic, especially, the number of  recoveries were much more numerous than the deaths:  probably two to one; which shows a moro manageable typo of  disease than was experienced in 1823 or 1825.    During the  month of October, the type of the disease was more malignant and fatal.    Several cases which occurred in Washing  ton and the country, from having visited the city, assumed tlit  character of a high grade of bilious fever; and, we are informed, many of tho more manageable enscs in tho city, were  of the same character.  The first cases and deaths occurred in that part of the city,  south, south-east, and south-west of the intersection of Commerce and Main streets, near the heads of several largo ravines and the flat surfaces above them. About the middle of  October, it had extended over the greater part of the city; but  prevailed mostly in the declivities leading towards ihe several  large ravines which put up on the south, south-west and southeast pails of tho city. Tho north-eastern half of the city  could hardly be saiel to havo been visited by tho epidemic.  The squares in which it first and most prevailed, were occu-  hundred yards, to tho height of from twenty to forty j-„(.t  The bottoms, and often the sides of these ravines, when not  perpendicular, are carpeted with n short, fine grass, called  the " Bermuda grass," which admits of no spontaneous accumulation of filth, The disease prevailed much in the same  vicinity in 1819, as I have been assured by an eye witness,  The weather, for several weeks previous to the middle of  August, had been attended by frequent showers and heavy  rains. The spring had been very late and cold. From the;  middle of August to the first of October, the weather was  dry and very hot, with occasional showers. The thermometer, in the coolest situation of the open air, averaged, for the  last fifteen days of August, at 0 o'clock, A.M., 70°; nnd at  3 P. M., 91°: for the first fifteen days of September, at G  A. M„ 72°; and at 3 JVM- 91°: during the first fifteen days  of October, at 6 A. M , 08°; and at 3 P. M. 78°. The first  fifteen or twenty days of November, likewise, were nearly  up lo summer heat, being often above SO*. Tho cool weather which occurred for a few days about the last of October  and the first of November, appeared to have put a checli to  the disease; but it broke out again dining ihe warm weather  of the first twenty days of November, Several of those who  returned to the city as late as the 15th of November, fell vie  thus to the infected air contained in closed houses, after there  lud been several frosts. Ofthis class were the deaths which  took place on the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th of November;  on each of which days the burials were from four to seven.  A severe rain, followed by cold winds, and freezing on the  night of the 20th and 21st of November, finally destroyed  infection. The last death of those previously attacked,  or infected, took place on the 25th of November.  The health of tho city, previous to the first of September,  was very good: no uncommon degree of sickness prevailed in  the vicinity, showing the disease in the city from causes operating locally. Tho yellow fever had been prevailing with  great mortality in New Orleans for nearly six weeks before it  broke out in Natchez, during which time many patients with  yellow fever, were received into the hospital, direct from New  Orleans, no quarantine restrictions being imposed.  The only cause assigned for this epidemic, so fur as 1 have  been able to ascertain, is the old one of 1817 and 1819, viz:  digging down and filling Up the low parts of the city; and,  ilso, city filth in certain back yards, sewers, &c. On both of  these, as a cause of yellow fever, we have already remarked  freely.  Without entering into a close argument to prove the point,  wc believe tho circumstances connected with the epidemic ol  1837, ns well as of previous years, show, that when the malarious contamination of the atmosphere has attained its maximum, as a predisposing cause of disease, a few cases o(  , 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/511	511	512.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/512.jp2

SOUTH-WESTERN  JOU  K N A L  151  sporadic yellow fever, excited into action by any exciting  rinse, will furnish an infectious matter, which, in this mala-  .:., will gradually extend itself, and become more active by  accumulation; when it becomes both an exciting and predisposing cause of yellow lever; mid thus brings on the opi.  (leniic. The samo eflect, ceteris paribus, will be produced  bythe introduction of infected air, or of patients laboring  trader yellow fever.  .\s to the locality of the origin of the yellow fever in  Natchez, a few remarks may be added.    Tho city is situated  inon high, broken ground, near two hundred feet above the  ordinary stage of wnter in tho river, and covers an urea of  uboul one mile square. As the ground rises towards the river,  ihere is no drain in that direction: and the whole: drainage  i,f the cily passes off in a south-west direction, through a  large nnd deep ravine or bayou, whose two main branches  originate on opposite skies of the city; one on the north and  injl north-west, and tho other on the south and south-east.  From inch of these principal branches, there tire other lateral branches, which originate is three of the lowest parts of  the city, and  carry off the  water lo the main trunks of tho  bayou.   Tho main bayou anel its principal branches, where  they assume that character, arc deep, jagged, precipitous, and  crooked ravines, from ten to thirty feet deep,and from twenty  tu fifty feet wide, formed by the washing and undermining of  lbs loose, friable earth,     When the yellow fever has made  its appearance as nn epidemic, in the upper cily, it has always  broken out and spread in the vicinity of some of these deep  ravines; or a little higher up, where they spread out into  low, licit grounds.    In every instance, it has spread about and  near these localities, varying ils particular locality according  lo the direction  of the winds,  until it has gradually spread  •■ii r a great portion of tho city.    At tho time it first breaks  cut, if the winds blow gently from the north-west, the fever  will appear on the south-east of the bayou ; if from the southeast, it will appear on the north-west of the bayou, and rice  versa.   These points and facts are confirmed by the knowledge of our oldest citizens, who have witnessed all these epidemics,    They are  likewise confirmed by the unqualified  testimony of Dr. Cartwright, in his able essays on the malig-  nantfevers of Natchez.    In direct proportion to the vicinity  of any part of the city to these bayoux, and the exposure to  die gentle winds at the time, so will be the prevalence of the  disease in that section.    In  1825, a heavy north-west wind,  wein the epidemic, carried the infected air nearly a mile out  ef the south-east part of the city, and produced the yellow  ■ever there.     Dr. Cartwright says, "the vicinities of these  bayoux arc the points most infected, where the fever was more  malignant and continued much later than other points to which  •be infection had extended."*    In those houses, in  1825,  which were nearest the bayoux, especially tho south-eastern  °ne, he thinks few or none of the inhabitants escaped yellow  fcver: although in other remote parts of the city, only common bilious fever was prevailing.!

For the accumulation of this infectious air or malaria, in  these bayoux, in its i  come charged with i  the city in hot, sultry weather, to be wafted by the only breezes  which occur, and to settle in these bayoux, and thus unite with  the miasm there existing : after this union, a gentle change of  winds agitates it out ofthe bayoux and low places, and wafts it  back upon the contiguous population ; others, in remote parts  of the city, often contract it by passing into these points. When  the yellow fever breaks out as an epidemic, it will he found  that the winds, if there be any, are in a direction nearly ihe  reverse of what they were probably ten days previously. So  that there will not be yellow fever in and about the soulh-east  partsof the city, unless there should have been gentle winds  previously from the west or north-west; and, in like manner,  there will have been no epidemic yellow fiver in and about  the north-west parts of the city, unless it has been preceded  by gentle breezes from the south-east, Wc might extend the  illustration of these facts to a much greater length; but we  deem it unnecessary.  We think- it has been shown, that these bayoux arc either  directly or indirectly a fruitful source ol yellow fever malaria, when the proper kinds of seasons have preceded. We  cannot conceive it possible, that this malaria is generated  from filth in these bayoux: our reasons have been given at  length; and the subject is left to the discriminating observations of those who may be so unfortunate as to reside in the  cily when it may bo again visited willi this epidemic.  COROLLARIES.  If tho views herein advanced be correct, the following arc  cgitimate deductions.  I, That the miasm, or gaseous matter which is essential to  the production of epidemic yellow fever, is generated only  while the extreme temperature in the shade, is at least up to  SS° of Fahrenheit; and that so long as there is sufficient  agitation and change of the air by winds, it will not accumulate in sufficient quantity to produce yellow fever as an epi-  that when sufficient miasm is produced and accumu-  p. 8, 9.  ated, the malarious combination, which likewise requires  several days of culm, sultry weather, will proceed at a still  lower temperature.  II. That the miasm of yellow fever, is, per se, in a pure  atmosphere, probably innoxious ; but acquires active morbific  properties by combining with sultry, hot air, which has been  exhausted by respiration, and charged with human exhalations; and that it then becomes malaria, or infectious air,  which is an active predisposing cause, as well as a proper  "nidus" for the reception and evolution of the infection of  yellow fever.  II I. That this malarious condition ofthe local atmosphere  of any city, or portion of n city, may be so concentrated as  to produce a strong predisposition to yellow fever in many of  the inhabitants, without actual disease, until a few cases are  •xcited into action by highly exciting onuses, when infection  ■'t-tii  .il  ''•-v'-i':M'r.

IV. That when the malarious combination is sufficiently  concentrated for this purpose, a large quantity of infected  air, brought from an infected district, or a large number of  cases of yellow fever introduced from another poirft, will  convert that malaria into infected air, and produce an epidem  ic likewise.  V. That, consequently, although yellow fever is very  often a disease ol local origin, ii may, under peculiar circu  stances, be carried from one city to another, and there progu-  gated.  VI. That accordingly epidemic yellow fever may be  averted sometimes by one or all of the following measures,  enforced at a time, when, according to the principles herein  sot forth, the malaria is forming rapidly; viz:  1. By a dispersion of tho greater portion ofthe citizens  to the country.  2. By removing from the city, and especially from the  districts usually infected, all strangers, or those who have  not become acclimated by a residence of two or three years,  and who would in course bo the first attacked.  3. By prohibiting the introduction from foreign places of  infected air, or fomitcs, or patients laboring under yellow  fever, during the prevalence of malarious accumulations.  VII. That the vicinity of any of the largo bayoux, or  gullies about Natchez, is more dangerous as a residence than  more remote points: that these ravines are the reservoirs in  which the malaria mostly accumulates before it is dispersed  through the city by gentle winds: of course persons should  avoid them in ihe sultry, autumnal months.  VIII. That this miasm, or even the malaria, is not the result  of animal or vegetable decomposition; or of exhalations  from city filth and such like sources.  IX. That tho general atmosphere in the country may be  as healthy us ordinary, while in the city yellow fever may be  sweeping off the population like a pestilence: of course,  that the disease is the result of some local atmospheric contamination.  X. That when the infection has spread, or is beginning  to spread, the only safety for those who arc strangers, or un-  acciimaled to yellow fever infection, is speedy flight: for no  disinfecting agents heretofore known, or tried, possess any  power to destroy the infection of yellow fever in the general  air, cold alone excepted.  XII. Thai those who seek safety in flight, should carry  with them as few bulky, light articles, of a woolen or porous  texture as practicable, lest they might generate on infected  nir in their retreat: That they should not return to their  houses until after cold winds and frosts, during which their  rooms, bedding, &c, have been freely exposed to ventilation  and to the action of the frost.

"On the eastern shore of Pascagoula Bay, in Jackson  county, State of Mississippi, near its mouth, are the luins of  an ancient fortification, built, apparently, many centuries oco  Il appears to have been constructed chiefly of sea-shells.  Within this ruin, several feet below the surface, have b«n  found charred coals, and fragments of a peculiar kind ol  earthen ware, together with many human bones. Amongst  them were discovered parts of a human skeleton of gigantic  proportions. The upper part of ihe skull was said lo be sufficiently large to fit loosely over the largest modern heods.  " All historical traces of the origin of this fortress have  long since disappeared. There is, however, a tradition still  extant amongst the old French scitleis on the Bay, said lo  have been derived from the Indians, who inhabited the coast  on ils first settlement by the French, that this fortification was  built by a tribe of Indians long since extinct, known as the  Biluxies. *  According to the legend, this tribe was at war with a more  powerful neighboring tribe. After many successive defeats,  they were driven to tho sea shore, where they built thisfoiti-  fication; they were closely and vigorously besieged for n  considerable lime, till their suppliis became exhausted, and  they were reduced to llic last extremity. Hope having deserted them, they marched into the ocean and perished!  ' In this neighborhood is frequently heard the most extraordinary and strange music. It is heard in the summer months  only, and on tho most calm and serene cve'iiings, usually after  sunset. It is said to bo truly melodious, resembling several  instruments in conceit: the most perfect harmony is preserved through its various cadences, though no peculiar notes or  instruments are imitated. The sound appears to have no peculiar or limited bounds,—but seems to be transitory,—sometimes appeariug to be in the water,—then immediatelj'  changing its position, seems to be transferred to tho atmosphere, approaching and receding nt intervals, sometimes dr-  ing away for some minutes, and then suddenly reviving w"11  '   I-, 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/513	513	514.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/514.jp2

Leaving out of view tho poetry of the foregoing legend,  where, we ask, on tho page of history, can be found a more  thrilling tale than that of the. extinction of the Biluxies, allowing the truth of the tradition?

The deed of tho Biluxies, if true, was one of hom-  age to the comparative kindness of inanimate nature. As  they looked towards the land, they saw human forms like  their own; as they looked sea-ward, they saw the ruinous  and wasteful deep,—yet far moro kind in its cruelty than their  fellow man. * * * * * * They raised a nation's  dtatk song, and marched into their ocean grave !      V  153  Aristocracy saw that an uneducated people-though it might  be a most humble servant—was yet a most dangerous foe.  The middle classes saw that they needed strength  from the  lower; and tho lowor, that they could rise only by the development of the powers of mind.    All cried out for Univer-  sal Education ; and  the schoolmaster went abroad to teach  lessons which Tyranny fears but never can tinteach.    In no  part of Europe, perhaps, is this  wholesome agitation unknown.    It stirs the thoughtful nations as the soft breeze ripples the clear deep sea.    It comes not the herald of tempest  and wreck, but of the steady gale that shall bear onward the  bark of human improvement while the waters of time shall  flow.    Not only may this spirit bo discerned in those places,  here education, long ago cherished under the genial influences of Christianity, has perpetuated itself.    Behold it at  work, in the lately rude and merely warlike Prussia—now  become, under a regal government both  humane and wise,  a model school for the world.

Behold, how the prejudices of Mohammedanism are giving way—the printing press in Constantinople—and a new interpretation given to the Koran, that the.  ravages of the plague may be stayed by a quarantine.   Egypt  calls back the genius of civilization, and the arts and letters  lie cherished in the bosom of their ancient mother.    Look  every where !

Tho soils, being produced by the decomposition of rocks, with the exception of  the alluvial formations, vary of course with ihe nature of the  strata which they overlie, and these qualities are readily  known, when the rocks from which they are produced are ascertained.  For iho purpose of grouping tho various kinds of rocky,  in order lo illustrate the mineral and agricultural resources of  the county, it is divided into four principal regions; the basin  of tho Paluxent, including the valley of flawling s river; the  basin of Rock Creek; that of tho Seneca and ihe Sugar binds,  so called. The basin of the Patuxent is about twenty-three  miles long, and its greadest breadth six miles. In ils upper  part the rocks are magnesian, and the soil produced from them  is quite meagre nnd arid. Under some circumstances, however, they produce by decomposition a light red soil, which  yields well in a slnty horneblende, it gives rise to n good oals  and corn, and when it passes into wheat soil. In the lower  and central portions of this region, the soils, though of little  depth, are good, but highly improvable by the usual tillage.

It is watered by uii--  raerous and constant streams, affording a good supply of water power, and the wells, which are from thirty to fifty feet  deep, yield water of great purity, thereby contributing largely  to the health und comfort of the inhabitants.  The basin of Rock Creek consists in a succession of subordinate hills between the more elevated ridges, supporting a  soil that varies according to tho nature of the subjacent strata.  They 'eirm what were formerly considered among the best  hods in the country, but have been exhausted by repeated  crops of tobacco and corn, without any rest or return of vegc-  lable nutriments, Hence a large portion of the county pre-  isnts a barren aspect, with the exception of some few fields,  which, by good management, have yielded profitable crops.  Tin's division embraces some fine tracts of woodland, consisting of oaks, hickory, sycamore, poplar and walnuts in the  richer bottoms. It is well watered. The valleys ofthe several streams afford valuable meadow lands, and pure water  can be obtained in abundance.  The basin of the Seneca is well watered for agricultural,  as well as manufacturing and economical purposes. In this  region occurs that valuable mineral, ore chrome. Serpentine  is die prevailing rock, and where this occurs, the soil is poor  and ill adapted to cultivation, but the mineral beneath makes  amends for this deficiency. In this division, also, the lands  uro very generally waste and unimproved, though there are  some good farms. It is well watered, elevated and healthy.  The sugar lands are so called, from having been originally covered by tho sugar maple. Some of the most valuable  estates of tho county arc located in this region, which presents ihe usual agricultural advantages, and by its proximity  tu the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, enjoys great facilities for  llic transportation of its products; which are principally tobacco, corn, oats, rye and wheat.

The affectionate recollection  and admiration of the dead will act gently upon our spirits,  and fill us with a composed seriousness, favorable to tho best  and most honorable contemplations.  ii','  ■' -Ca- ■  ifi  ■J. :»f I  i  m  ■ ii  _  ^^1 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/516	516	517.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/517.jp2

At the close of the thirteenth century, the human intellect  awoke from its sleep. The Monk of Pisa, who invented  spectacles—a most divine invention—which gave sight to the  blind, may be said, without any exaggeration, lo have furnished eyes to tho soul, as well as the body. Shall we ascribe too much importance to this invention, if we impute to  it the effect of drawing men's thoughts from the crudities of  the metaphysical dogmas of the schools, to an investigation  of the eternal truths of nature ? It led the way to the bright  career of discovery and invention. The magnetic needle  came into common use, and the mariner, trusting to this mys  terious guide, boldly crossed the broadest seas; the ships of  the enterprising Venetians, passing beyond the utmost bourn  dary of geographical knowledge, brought home the strange  story of the discovery of Greenland and its desolate inhabitants. The lucubrations of the alchemists, too, were a lent  to develope a capital result, not indeed the making of gold,  but a result whose effect was lo destroy forever the distinction'  of physical power: the savage was no Ion-,.,. ,„ [.j,,,,,,,],  over the civilized man, nor were the works of art or of science ever again to be endangered by an irruption of ignorant  barbarians.    The power of man, his mere physical powcrjgavea new world  was indefinitely exalted, and the force which nature bad denied him in making him one of the weakest of creatures, mil  compensated by science more than a thousand fold, when she  gave him gunpowder. To this period, too, wc are to refer  another invention of vast benefit—the mode of consuming  pit coal—an invention which has exercised an immense influ,  enco over the condilion of nations, and lo which the country  from whence we all draw our descent, mainly owes her position in arts and arms.  Next came the great epoch. Gunpowder had given to  man a kind of earthly omnipotence : printing was to give his  works immortality, to difiuse throughout all the ramification!  of society, the knowledge that had been hoarded tip by a far  No more might the philosopher fear that his labors, in the  conflicting interests of nations, or passions of party, should  be lost. Civilized man could spread out and perpetuate his  intellectual productions. If there be any great landmark in  ihe history of the earth—anything that points out the distinct character of one age from another, surely it is to be nut  with in these great discoveries. We are not to suppose, ihat  men now possess more ability than at earlier ages; at a remote  period, the Chaldeans had discovered the true system of the  world, and had built up theories which we are now confirming. They wanted, however, the physical powers to disseminate their knowledge, and to protect themselves from the destruction that menaced them from more ignorant nations.  Bofore the invention of priming and gunpowder, the world's  history was a perpetual squabble of one prince with another,  one nation with its rival. With a few exceptions, its philosophy was a vain show, a thing not applicable to the comforis  or purposes of life. Notions of military glory made conquest  the end of human ambition and of human happiness; and he  who had murdered most, and burned most, and ruined most,  and pillaged most, was the greatest man: it was a conquest  of man over his fellow, a conquest not less disgraceful to the  vanquished than to tho victor. Instead of subduing nature,  and thereby raising the standard of power and wisdom, nil  the bad passions that can be engendered in the breast of mortals bore sway, and rapine and murder required no apology,  provided the scale on which they were carried was sufficiently large-. How greatly changed was tho world at ihe epoch  of which I speak ; men began to find out, that there were other ways to be powerful without the destruction of their rivals,  and that to conquer nature with her own weapons, wiisthe  only mode to be truly great. And now for a while the results of successful experiment followed each other with rapid-  ity, not only in those giant discoveries which had regenerated  the world, but also in the arts of peace, the arts that adorn civilized life. The construction of maps and charls, which jni  introduced, tended in no small degree to hasten the discovery  of America. Engraving on copper gave a new impulse 10  painting, and secured faithful representations of natural objects, where words anel printing might fail to describe them  Navigation felt ibc great improvements that astronomy, mag-  nctism, geography, and printing had bestowed.

Magellan, a Portuguese,  157  nspir  than  ships &lt;  rincr to the fame of Columbus, sailed through the straits  iat still bear his name : nnd Europe saw wilh astonishment  which had circumnavigated the world.    The telescope  ,.,-U produced—watches were first made—the variation of the  compass assigned—and improvement extended even to the  minor arts; skewers, which had been used by ladies, were  banished, and the common brass pin substituted in their stead.  It is a truth, that whatever improvements take place in the con  ditioaof men, originate with themselves; and all governments  have been found either to oppose, or only to yield slowly to  them. For teaching the true system ofthe world—for the discovery of the secondary planets, the moons of Jupiter—for  -hoiving spots on the sun, the holy inquisition laid violent  hands on Galileo, an immortal man ; and Ihe same government, that was forced by the times to establish in England, by  act of Parliament, the book of common prayer, caused to be  burned by the common hangman, tho books of astronomy and  geography, because they were infected with magic.    But the  persecutions which were endured by philosophers from the  iiialice of princes, could neither rein nor stop the progress of  knowledge.    Decimal arithmetic, with all ils advantages,  was promulgated, and soon after a Scotch Baron invented  logarithms; the thermometer made its appearance in Holland; and that maritime spirit which had doubled the Capes  of South Africa and South America, already sought a northwest passage lo India, and projected a visit lo the north pole.  Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood—a discovery  thai lias done more for the advancement of medical science  than almost all that prcdeded it.    Torricelli invented the  barometer, and proved that air possessed weight.   Huygens  invented the pendulum clock; Otto Guerick constructed the  lirsl air pump, and exposed bodies to a vacuum.    The current of discovery was now fairly in motion—scientific asso  nations were springing up in every country; and had things  •till gone on in their usual  channel, the accumulation of  knowledge would  have been great; but a propitious event  occurred—for at the close of 1642, Isaac Newton was born ;  " man whom God made, to comprehend his works.  I might here expatiate at length on the consequent development of all parts of natural science, not only those cultivated by this groat man, but those too surveyed by his disciples. I might point your attention to the discovery they  made, of the system of the universe, how they weighed  worlds, and told their distances and magnitudes. I might  '•escribe bow they effected the analysis of light, and gave us  'be reflecting and achromatic telescopes; but time would fail  me. I come, therefore, to confine myself more strictly to the  binits I have proposed, to examine whether the legacy of  knowledge handed down has been improved. Science should  "cither stand still nor be on the decline, but progress forward,  ""d push her conquests into the unexplored region of know-  'edge. Hovy much greater are our inducements than those  °f earlier philosophers ! Wc havo learned from their experience how vast a treasure we arc the guardians of—a  treasure obtained by years of anxiety, thought and pain. Let  w recollect how short the span  of life, and let us gather,   i - -—  from what we i  now to consider, a fresh de  forward on the stage of life, and has  termination to  n but lo die; be comes  is his day. Every moment the elements that are around him, contend with him for  mastery, and solicit his destruction. Should he escape Ihe  repealed irruptions of disease, the years that pass slowly over  him wear him away; one by one, all his faculties leave him :  bis animal life decays, and at last becomes extinct; his remaining functions are slowly and imperfectly performed.  Nature, always provident, takes from him the knowledge of  his end, or even makes that end desirable. I'he ties of his  youth are broken, the endearments of other times havo  ceased to exist, nnd the terrors that youth and health have  planted over the tomb, nre forgotten; the tranquil slumber  of death comes calmly to close the troubles of life, and the  old man sinks down in the lap of his mother earth, and quietly sleeps in her bosom. Then, seeing these things arc so,  et us resolve to discharge our duty to the future—to transmit  what we haverecived, not only unimpaired, but with an honorable increase.—Southern Literary Messenger.  VOYAGING ON THE MISSISSIPPI.  This morning we seemed lo bo lost among islands in a  waste of waters. The vastness of the river now began to  bear upon our'imnginnlions. The flatboats we met seemed  to be at the mercy of the floods, their long oars bending like  straws in the current. They are so picturesque, however,  and there is something so fanciful in the canopy ol green  boughs under which the floating voyagers repose during the  heat of the day, that some of US proposed building a flat-boat  on the Ohio, and floating down to New Orleans at our U. i-  sure.  Adams fort, in the state of Mississippi, afforded the most  beautiful view wo had yet seen on the river. The swelling,  hills, dropped with wood, closed in a reach ofthe waters, and  gave them the appearance of a lake. White houses nestled  in the clumps; goats, black and white, browsed on the points  of the many hills ; nnd a perfect harmony of coloring dissolved the whole into something like a dream. This last  charm is as striking to us as any in the vast wilderness through  which the "Father of Waters" takes his way. Even turbid floods, varying their hues with the changes of light and  shadow, are a fit clement of the picture, and no one wishes;  them other than they are.  I was on the lookout for alligators all the way up the river,  but could never see one. A deck passenger declared that a  small specimen slipped offa log into tho water one day, when  nobody else was looking; but his companions supposed that  he might be mistaken, as alligators are now rarely seen in  this region. Terrapins were very numerous, sometimes  sunningthcmsclves on floatinglogs, and sometimesswiniming,  with only their pert little heads visible above water. Wood  pigeons might bo seen flitting in tho forest, when we were so  close under the- banks as to pry into the shades, and the beautiful blue-jay often gleamed before our eyes. No object was  more striking than the canoes which wo frequently saw, looking fearfully light and frail amid the strong current.

There is nothing more awful than to attempt to cast a  glance among the clouds and mists which hide the broken  extremity of the celebrated bridge of Mirza. Yet, when  •ivory day brings us nigher that termination, one would almost think our views should become clearer. Alasl it is  not so: there is a curtain to be withdrawn, a veil to be rent,  before we shall see things as they really are. There are  tew, I trust, who disbelieve the existence of a God; nay, I  doubt if, at all times and in all moods, any single, individual  ever adopted that hideous creed, though some have professed  it. With the belief of a Deity, that of the immortality of  tlio soul and of the state of future rewards and punishments,  is indissolubly linked. More we are not to know of: but  neither are we prohibited from all attempts, however vain,  to pierce the solemn, sacred gloom. The expressions used  in scripture are, doubtless, metaphorical, for penal fires and  heavenly melody are only applicable to beings endowed with  corporeal senses; and, at least till the period of the resurrection, the spirits of men, whether entering into the perfection  of the just, or committed to the regions of punishment, are  not connected with bodies. Neither is it to be supposed that  the glorified bodies which shall arise in the last day, will be  capable of the same gross indulgence with which ours are  now solaced. That the idea of Mahomet's paradise is inconsistent with the purity of our heavenly religion, will be  readily granted ; and see Mark xii. 35.

'  " In passing through Bonn, upon the Rhine, I visited Pro-  lessor Noeggeratti, a distinguished mineralogist of that university. He spoke with great interest of our efforts in reference to mineralogy, and especially of the American Jour-  nal. He observed to me that, singular as it was, he had received through that Journal iho first account of nn interesting fact in his own neighborhood.  " He had heard many years since of a large mass of iron  lying on one ofthe mountains termed 'the Seven Mountains,'  in this vicinity, but which was supposed to be a remnant of  an old furnace. He designed to examine it, but delayed from  time to time, and at length heard that a foreign officer had  been there and taken away a large portion, He thought little more of it, until some time after, when ho saw in the  American Journal of Science, Col. Gibbs' account of his  discovery of a mass of meteoric iron on this very spot. He  immediately went to examine the fact: he found that the  mass had been cut up and put into the forge, but the smiths  not having skill to work it, it was again thrown aside, nnd  ay buried under a heap of scoria. Professor N., after some  search, discovered a very large quantity of this iron, and  verified the existence of nickel, and tho truth of the account  which the American Journal had been the medium of announcing to the world, of one of the largest masses of meteoric iron yet discovered."—Silliman's Journal.  . may read all his life, and form no conception of the  ish of ii mountain-torrent, or the waving of a forest of pines  in a storm J and a man may study in his closet the heart of  i:.- fellow-creatures forever, and have no idea of the power  cf ambition, or the strength of revenge.

METEORIC IRON IN TEXAS.  A gentleman returned from a five years' absence in the  province of Texas, during which time he had been frequently with the Camanche Indians, and a small party of them  conducted him to a mass of metal lying on the bank of a  creek. Its length was four feet, and it was about one foot  H|tmm [at the end.) It required six of the Indians to raise  ii on end. A piece weighing two ounces was cut off by a  tomahawk. It possessed great hardness and tenacity, and  v.'hcn hammered (in the cold) shewed great malleability, be-  ing easily beaten out very thin without cracking or scaling.  The color was stated to be between that of gold and silver.  Its lustre was remarkable, and could not be tarnished by any  thing that was done to it, oven by the application of heat,  I'll- large mass of metal seemed to defy every attempt to  make an impression on it, except under the hammer, when it  became pliable and soft. From the acquaintance which we  have wilh the large mass alluded to above, wo cannot doubt  that the piece described in Mr. Cox's letters is nickeliferous  meteoric iron Those that saw tho piece were disposed to  make it out to be gold, and probably saw a yellow tint quite  as strongly as it existed, if indeed it existed at all, for the  malleable iron which we have from tho same region is like  that of Siberia, of a remarkable pure grayish white, with a  Ugh degree of lustre  " i' have recently seen a gentleman, who stated that he  hew of several large pieces of malleable iron in Texas,  and we hope to obtain some more precise information con-  c(,rning them.  METEORIC IRON IN FRANCE.  The late Col. George Gibbs brought to this country some  feces of meteoric iron which he detached frpmalarge mass  tying on the mountains of Auvergne in France, and a notice  °&lt; h was published in Dr. Bruce's Journal of Mineralogy,  &gt;n connexion with one of the Louisiana iron.  The following extract is taken from a letter addressed to  THE FUTURE CAPITOL OP THE UNION.  We climbed the hill, wild with tall grass and shrubs, and  obtained a view of Cincinnati, which is considered (he com-  pletest. I now perceived that, instead of being shut in between two hills, the city stands on a noble platform, round  which the river turns while the hills rise behind. The platform is perfectly ventilated, and the best proof of this is the  healthiness of the city, above all other American cities. A  physician who had been seven years a resident told me that  he had been very delicate in health before he came, like  many others of the inhabitants; and, like many others, he  had not had a day's illness since his arrival. Tho average  of deaths in the cily during the best season was seven per  week; and, at the worst time of the year, the mortality was  less than in any city of its size in the republic. There is  ample room on the platform for a city as large as Philadelphia, without encroaching at all on the hill-sides. The inhabitants are already consulting as to where the capitol shall  stand whenever the nation shall decree the removal of the  general government beyond tho mountains. If it were not  for tho noble building at Washington, this removal would  probably take place soon, perhaps after the opening of the  great Southern railroad. It seems rather absurd to call  senators and representatives from Washington to Missouri  and Louisiana, while there is a place on the great rivers  which would save them half the journey, and suit almost  every body else just as well, and many much better. The  peril to health at Washington in the winter season is great,  and the mild and equable temperature of Cincinnati is an  important circumstance in tho case.

Wo continued  eastward along tho bank of the river for seven miles, the  whole scenery of which was beautiful; but the unforgotten  spot was the level about the mouth ofthe Little Miami river,  the richest of plains or level valleys, studded with farmhouses, enlivened with clearings, and kept primitive in appearance by the masses of dark forest which filled up all the  unoccupied spaces. Upon this scene wo looked down from  a great height, a Niphates of the new world. On entering  a little pass between two grassy hills, crested with wood, we  wero desired to alight. I ran up the ascent to tho right, nnd  was startled at finding myself on the top of a precipice. Far  beneath me ran the Little Miami, with a narrow white pebbly strand, arrow-like trees springing over from the brink of  the precipice, and the long evening shadows making the current as black as night, while the green, up to the very lips of  the ravine, was of the sunniest, in the last flood of western  lie-lit.—Miss Harriet Martincau.  To Correspondents.—Wo learn that Professor Carpenter, of the Louisiana College in Jackson, Louisiana, lately read before a literary society an interesting and valuable  paper on the "Organic Remains found in the State of Louisiana. " 'May wo not be permitted lo solicit a copy for publication in the South-Western Journal ?  The Lyceum—Tho next meeting of the Lyceum will  bo holden in the Methodist Church, in the city of Natchez,  on Saturday night, tho fifth of May.  The principal exercise of the evening will bo a Chemlcai  Lecture "on the Properties of Water," delivered by Dr. S.  C. Merwin, accompanied by experiments.  The church has been generously thrown open for the oc  casion, and a general invitation is cordially extended to ladies and gentlemen not members ofthe Lyceum, and the pub  iic at large, to attend on this occasion.  Periodical Literature.—The literary periodicals sent  in exchange for the South-Western Journal, are greeted with  pleasure, A welcome to their bright faces, radicnt with the  intellect of the north and the cast I  The Knickerbocker {nomen vencrabile) comes wiih its  nervous, figgety, compact little old New Amsterdam historian, as a vignette on the cover. This is one of the most successful publications of the day, abounding in highly useful  as well as pleasing and attractive miscellany.  The pride of the " old dominion " also, the Southern Literary  Messenger, with  its proud chivalrous bearing, ami  high-toned sentiment, is before us, growing choicer withea I  month, and more worthy of the proud south.  Wo have the " American Quarterly Register," theorrr  of the American Education Society—a quarterly filled vriil  the most important statistics, and  the annals of the oldti  times of our own country.  The "Christian Review" from Boston, solicits our attn  tion by its ably written papers and discriminating reviews  The Yalo Literary Magazine comes fresh from th,.

The Family Magazine, from Cincinnati, in its later numbers more than sustains its former excellence. lis pictorial  representations improve, while the selections seem lo kttp  pace with the activity of this high-pressure age.  Interesting to Sculptors.—It is stated in the National Intelligencer, that Mr. Factherslonhaugh.Uniltd Statu  Geologist, has ascertained tho existence of some important  deposites of white statuary marble, in the Cherokee country.  lie has followed an obscure ridge in the mountains six miles,  consisting entirely of that valuable substance, hitherto onlv  seen in the United States, in thin beds, not exceeding a fen-  inches. He reports one- of these deposites as equal to thai  of Massa Carrara in Italy, with which he is familiar. Marble of this kind has been hitherto brought, nt a great expense,  from Italy. The block for the statue of Hamilton, destroyed by fire in tho Exchange, if we mistake not, was repre.  sented to have cost not less than two thousand dollars.  Colonel Sherburne, of Washington city, who had been for  some weeks past in the Cherokee nation, on business for  government, has, wo have been informed, contracted with the  owner for the purchase of the land on which this valuable*  and beautiful marble was discovered by the celebrated geologist above named. It is thought to be inexhaustible anil  more valuable than any gold mine yet discovered in the  Cherokee nation, being of that cast as not only lo command  a good price, but will be in very great demand.

John Milton, the immortal poet, says : There are no songs  comparable to the songs of Time, no orations equal to those  of the prophets, and no politics like tho Bible for excellent  wisdom and use.

EXTRACT OF A LECTURE,  Dnelboforathe Ladles' Inatltute and Lyceum or the, City of Natchez, April 7tli,  1833, by J. A, Van Hoesen, Esq.  Ladies op the Lyceum:  It is with mingled feelings of pleasure and regret that I  appear before you, at this time, in the character of a public  akcr.  ipea  him pleased and delighted to see so many of the ladies of  Natchez assembled to give countenance and support to so  good a cause. And I regret exceedingly that you are not  favored with a more able and agreeable speaker. But as a  young man I should have been ungallant and modest in the  extreme, if I had refused the polite invitation extended to me  to address you on this occasion. I shall not, however, attempt to win my way by flattery. I shall merely state those  things which I believe to be truths, plainly and honestly.  I have ever believed that woman occupied the highest and  most responsible station in human society. And to discharge  the duties of her exalted station with fidelity and lionor, some  previous mental discipline or training is requisite. And I  believe, too, that her influence depends much on this previous  discipline or education. There seems to be a kind of omnipotence enthroned in the cultivated mind of woman, before  which vice, in all ils horrid forms, stands appalled, or vanishes like dew before the rays of the morning sun. But I  do not appear here lo attempt to show you the importance of  female education; nor as an advocate for female influence,  These subjects have already been presented to you by those  older and moro experienced than myself, and in a style which  I cannot expect to surpass, nor even equal. "Thefounda  tion* (of a course of Lectures) has been laid," and the first  polished stone placed upon it;t and you doubtless expect to  «cc the edifice, so nobly begun, continued with the same symmetry of proportion, and the same polish of style, until the  topmost stone shall be laid, and its spire shall pierce the very  heavens, and beckon the wanderer to its portals. Though I  shall endeavor to continue the work, I shall leave the polishing part to a more skilful and accomplished artist. The pen-  fillings and painting I will leave to a gentler hand, lest you  'nay accuse me of daubing with untempered mortar.  first, then, we will consider woman's proper sphere. Wo  man, from the delicacy of her constitution, the gentleness of  "er manners, and the timidity of her nature, was never calculated for Athletic or Olympic Exercises; was never destined for the battle field or the legislative hall; was never  wiled to guide tho tossing ship through the pathless deep;  nor "-as sho ever ordained as the minister of God, only as  "he administered at the domestic altar. From thence her  sacrifice may be offered, and the incense ascend pure and ho-  yi and, ascending from angel lips, may be borno on angels'  lin fust Lecture was read before Ihe Lyceum liy the Kev. Mr. Winchester.  '.« "Kernel by G. V. II. Forbes, Esq.  wings to the great Author of all good, and call down blessings on ils devoted subjects. It is for woman to purify,  cheer, and gladden the social circle, from which and through  which flows the spirit and feeling which is to give tone and  character to every department of life. The social or domes-  tic circle is the centre and fountain from which all the  streams of life take their rise; and in proportion as the fountain is pure and unadulterated, the streams and all tho branch,  es flowing therefrom will be pure and fertilizing. I do not  say that woman's sphere is confined to her own household.  It extends directly through the town and village in which  she lives; and indirectly as far and wide as her kindred, ties,  and connexions. It extends immediately amongst all her  friends and neighbors. The sphere of woman, however  seemingly circumscribed by physical lines, nevertheless extends in influence almost to infinity. Yes, her influence is  without bounds and without limits. But I am treading on  beaten ground. We have already been told, that we might  as well undertake to define the rays of the sun as to attempt  lo define female influence.  We will next consider how you may be the best prepared  to exert the most salutary influence in the sphere in which  nature has destined you to walk. One of the best female  accomplishments, and I may say one of the most valuable  acquirements, is to bo able to converse well. Conversation  is to the business of the world, what commerce and the arts  are to civilization and refinement. It is to society what eloquence and oratory are to the bar, to the pulpit, and to the  forum. How important, then, that the grace and elegance of  conversation should characterize and adorn the social circle.  The tone, the music, in short the poetry of society, is conversation. But I am aware, that, as as a people, we are rather utilitarian than ornamental. We prefer the cotton field to  the hanging garden ; the rich fruit, to the beautiful flower;  and the noble Doric architecture to the slender and beautiful  Ionic. We are surrounded on all sides by the useful. Our  country, on every hand, is intersected by canals, turnpikes,  and railroads; and our navigable rivers are constantly teeming with steamboats, floats, and sloops; and every breeze  brings to our commercial ports ships laden with the rich  cargoes of other climes. But conversation may be ornamen-  tal, interesting, instructing, and useful. To make it so, study,  reading and thinking are necessary. The treasury must be  prepared, before we can make drafts for the gold and silver  coin. Ladies, you have the casket; and how long shall it  be that we shall admire the casket rather than its contents?  It is high time that your mental armory should be polished,  and kept bright by use. There are many moral battles to bo  fought; and you must be champions in the field. You do  now, as you ever must, occupy the first rank; and if you give  way before we gain the vantage ground, all is lost: liberty,  happiness, and all, is gone.    But I am persuaded that you  ml  1 sia  I efVJ.i  ''■•■'",  ■■'■-.  mk  f : 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/523	523	524.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/524.jp2

And there is no study or reading, in my mind, more essential than that of history. True history is a record of past  events. It is the telescope by which we look back through  the long vista of time, and discover the different changes one"  epochs, which, in the story of the world, have marked its  advancement in civilization nnd refinement. It is a monument by which the memory of the dead is preserved 0  handed down to posterity. And the various epochs which  have been recorded in ihe history of the world, like antecedent and consequent, enable us to judge of the future by the  past; and thus we are enabled to shun the shoals and quiell  sands upon which the different nations and kingdoms of th  world have stranded. History is the ka.leie/ascopc by which  human nature is presented to us in all its varied forms and  combinations. We behold the mad ambition of kings ; th  avarice of the miser; the pride of the courtier j the passions  of the sensualist; and the arrogance of the simple. It pre  sents to us, in glowing colors, the judgment of the just; the  lenity of the gentle ; and the forbearance and long suffering  of the lender and merciful. And where is the person (man  or woman) who has read, studied, and thought, en the subject  of history, whose company will not be sought and admired,  and whose conversation will not be interesting and instructing  to every listener? And I care not whether his knowledge  has been obtained from the reading and studying of books, oi  from observation, and the study of the broad volume of nature—show me the person who has observed and noted carefully the things that have come within his or her observation;  nnd I will show you a person who is no novice in die science  of history, and one who will always be able to instruct and  delight,at least as far as matter is concerned ; nnd manner is  seldom wanting in the fair. But we must think also, now,  there is no person but what finds it easy enough to read and  study. But to think—here is the difficulty—people will not  think. If wc could only bring ourselves to think, then we  could accomplish almost any thing. It is an old saying,  that the learned think sometimes; the unlearned never. How  far this is true, I shall not undertake to say. But to become  a good historian, this faculty must be brought into requisition.  There is, perhaps, no study that improves the colloquial  powers more than the study of history. And there is no faculty so fascinating an! enchanting as the faculty of conversing  well, especially when found in woman. There is a kind of  poetry and charm in the soft and musical tones of a woman's  voice, by which man, spell-bound as it were, is led captive at  her will. And were her knowledge equal to the gentleness  and suavity of her manners, her power would be truly omnipotent. I would to God that she had this knowledge.  Then there would be no moro libations to Bacchus, and no  more sacrificing to the infernal Gods; but a pure and holy  incense would ascend from the altars of liberty, justice and  humanity, until our world should be freed from tho chains of  ignorance and superstition, and peace and good will to man  reign from tho rising of the sun to the going down of the  same. But history is not the only study which shoal,! cl  the attention of the American fair. When time and oppon  nity will permit, the mental and moral sciences, political ec  omy, and even the ancient classics may be studied with r&gt;- t  and advantage. These studies have a wonderful tendency  strengthen and invigorate the mind, and thus prepare you f  a wider and more extended sphere of influence.  But the fine arts come more immediately within von  sphere. Hero a field is opened in which yoti may disnlsv  all your talents and taslc, and occupy all your leisure time  —painting, drawing, music, instrumental and vocal,—and I  may add horticulture as affording agreeable diversion amies-  ercisc for the body. These arc certainly valuable accomplish,  ments.  But, above all things, the study ofthe Bible is the not:  useful and instructing, ns it is the most correct &lt;md authentic  history of man that ever was penned. The Bible is the  polar star by which tho wandering pilgrim is guided safely  to his father's house. But in all your reading and stud;,  yon should so learn as to be able to impart your knowledge:  and conversation is ihe only true medium of communication.  Without this, your knowledge is liko the miser's geld end  silver, locked up where it will rust and corrupt.  Next to a well stored mind, on which, ns from a rich treasury, one can draw for all the weapons of conversation, is  skill in using those weapons, or the mode of tempering  them. Demosthenes paid the great tribute of his-opinion to  action,—action, as the implement of oratory,—by which he  meant gesture, tone, intonation, pronunciation, and nil tie  concomitants of a graceful deliver}'. There is not a man or  woman who cannot teach themselves the pronunciation ol  llieir own tongue, and they may so learn it as lo pronounce  it with elegance and ease. The French ladies have always  been proverbial for llieir powers of conversation, and exhibit  more strongly the "jeu d'esprit" than any other people. Madam do Mairitenon, though embarrassed in circumstances;  though wanting many of the luxuries which graced the tables of her more wealthy neighbors, never failed to entertain her company well by the fascinating and interesting  manner of her conversation. The Athenian ladies were to  well versed in the arts that pertained to good speaking, that  even the fisherwomen could detect ihe slightest error in pro  nunciation or gesticulation. To make conversation good,  '.he matter should not only be good, but the manner nnd action should be combined with it: the whole soul should be  enlisted; the eyes, the countenance, and all, should Speak.  This is the electricity of conversation. " As the spirit within plays upon the. lip, and runs rippling in all the currents  of life, tho woman but of earth is exalted, in our eyes, lo ike  spirit divine. Who has not even seen ugliness, when kindled up by conversation, made to blaze whh beauty? Bat  when the eye of beauty brightens, and the lip quivers, anil  the cheek is suffused with a blush, whose heart docs not beat  quicker, as ho feels the magic of the tongue? Then it"  that conversation becomes, as it were, electric: it chases «P  the sluggish currents of our blood, and links the spin!  man with man."    Now what greater inducements can I now  out to you in favor of female education, than have ahead) 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/524	524	525.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/525.jp2

It  is a field in which you can, with nil  propriety, be laborers, and in which your labors will be re-  •aid by a rich harvest,    Need I point you to individual exiles?   Almost every age and every department of literature can boast of a female patron.    Greece had her Sappho,  and Romo her Erinna, both accomplished poets.    France  ]ler" Madame de Stael," and England her Lady Jane Gray,  I 'both of these were accomplished in the classics; nnd Italy  can boast many a fine musician.    But our own country and  our own age can boast of poets, novelists, and historians—a  distinguished.    There isno reason, then, why they should not  possess that influence which education nnd refinement are calculated to give them.    But there is every reason for us to  lake courage in our endeavors to raise higher the standard of  female education.    Where was ever the same opportunity  given to a lady for obtaining an education that is given to the  other sex, that her improvement did not surpass the expectation of the most sanguine?    Such is the elasticity of spirit,  fitch the vivacity of mind, such the quickness of perception,  an J such the volubility of woman, that she is ever ready to  yield to the impulse of pleasing emotion, and to borrow lustre from the fleeting refinements that occasionally light up the  monotony of life; and the imagination, quick as the lightning's flash, traverses the fair fields of nature, and from  thence gathers copious materials for delightful and interesting  conversation.    So quick and so ready are ladies in conversation. tlj.it it has grown into a proverb, that woman    *    *    *  '   •    *.    There is no consideration, however, that should  present so great inducements to you for study and improvement as usefulness.    This should be the great desideratum,  reared, and consecrated for our holy dwelling place, is full  of strength and majesty, but it requires the embellishment of  taste, and the delicate beauties of refinement, to soften that  strength, and to impart gracefulness to that majesty. I love  this dwelling place above all others on the earth. I believe  that God has placed us in it for glorious purposes—to de-  monstiate the capacity of man to govern each other in a republican foim—to prove again, that taste, and beauty, and  elegance, and refinement, spring from a government in such  a form, as in Greece and Rome of old, Venice, Florence,  Pisa, and Genoa, of the middle ages. I think I see its august  destiny traced out on the very geography ofthis land—in the  length and breadth, and volume of its rivers—in the grandeur of its hills and mountains, and the roar of ils cataract.  My ardent prayer to heaven is, we may be worthy of its destiny—we may shame tyranny and misgovcrnmenttho world  over—we may throw up such a beacon-light as will tempt  nations to follow us. The way is, to foster the high and intellectual nature of man—to cherish the fine oils of painting,  music, and sculpture, that soften and harmonize the world—  to polish society as it can be, by the lesser graces on earth,  lift us to the graces of heaven. Now we have laid broad and  deep the foundations of this temple of liberty, we must form  the man and woman that enter it. We must make melodious the discordant notes of a tumultuous world. Society  must be tuned, and'conversation, which are its notes, must be  fitted for the great trumpet ofthe goddess Liberty, that is to  sound in the ears of an admiring world. There is a sympathetic link in the chain of social intercourse, that quivers as  lis touched. The tones of a whole society are like the airs  that float through the yEolian harp. If the summer breeze  but gambols over ils strings, it sends forth sweet and sooth-  It is your influence, ladies, that must be exerted in behalf ofjing strains; but if the boisterous storm runs roughly over the  every good cause, before its advancement shall be rapid. All chords, it flings off notes harsh and discordant.    The tone of  your reading and study, all your accomplishments, and all  your embellishments, are calculated ultimately to give more  strength to your influence and increase your usefulness.  Th  dress and external appearance has often much to do in recommending to us what is useful.  Of two things, which are equally useful, wo prefer that  which has the most charms for the eye. So it is with every  thing-. In speaking we prefer the beautiful and well turned  period to a tedious and formal recital of facts. Your usefulness, like your influence, ladies, should know no bounds;  and you need not go abroad while so much remains to be  done at home. It is an old aphorism that charity begins at  home; and here let the work commence, and extend, until  the whole tone und character of society shall be exalted and  purified—until every vice and immorality shall be done  'Way, and truth, virtue and justice reign throughout our borders. Ladies, it is for you to say whether this change shall  lake place. Say it and the work will commence. To you  •a entrusted the care and protection of the rising generation.  « is for you to form their minds and direct them in the proper course. You must prepare them to receive the legacy-  left us by our fathers, and which we shall soon have to transmit to them.  "The beautiful temple of liberty which our fathers have  elevated society, and the converse of genial hearts, are like  the melodious notes that sprang from Memnon's statue, when  touched by the rays ol the morning sun. But tune society,  and it will pour forth melodies from a thousand strings."  Let American matrons but be determined to dedicate  their offspring to eternal virtue and truth, then will the stability of our republican institutions be as firm and enduring as  the everlasting hills, and our fame as bright as a lamp that  burns.

The rich diluvium that formed the upper crust of the earth  after the Noachian deluge, was deposited by our drop in com  mon with its coadjutors, after the weighty and barren rocks  had subsided from llieir admixture with the turbulent floods of  the grand cataclysm.  The solvent property that enabled it to hold in suspension  the bases of future vegetation, provided against the possibility  of a general and desolate sterility; and since that period the  same property has been in active operation, in the productioi  of those newly formed soils, known under the denomination  of alluvial; a process by which submerged lands and dan  gerous sandbars are elevated, and covered over with ihe de  bris of mouldering vegetation, richly impregnated with  embryos that shall spring up to tapestry these late formations  of the earth with new and living verdure. There is not a  geological change or a mincralogical fonnation, with which  our little drop is not conversant. Here by delicate attrition  against the rough surface of some shapeless rock it imbues  itself with silicious particles, which it again transforms by  magic power into a brilliant and symmetrical crystal, or it  deposites them as stalactites to hang like icicles against the  vaulted roof of some humid cavern. Now again we see it  concealed in the bosom of the caithand hid for ages from the  scrutiny of intrusive man, it superintends the formation of  those little minerals, which, by their scarcity nnd beauty,  seem more the elegant offspring of nature's pastime, than as  constituting any part of her more necessary products; or we  may regard them as the beautiful types of that creation which  shall exist when these heavens and this earth shall have  passed away. Having fulfilled its office in the supervision of  those refined and brilliant gems which adorn the earth, it becomes attached to some more humble mineral, washes modifies, and adapts it to purposes of art, or to the decorations of  refinement, and thus progressing onward it touches every in.  dividual in the series of mineral produ cts, and impressesupon  en to exhibi:  each the marks of ils omnipotent agency.    Th.  its powers upon a more inagnifinent scale, it m,lv n«  those mighty evolutions of nature, the tornado, eotthan l"  and volcano, which resemble ihe terrific bursting forth  i  some impetuous passion, and are the instruments that inn  uses when she would shatter man's presumptuous confide  in his control over her laws.  But the wisdom of God in the creation of this pccttlj  agent is constantly exhibited in that relation which burdro  sustains to the seasons, and lo those meteorological clianf  which constitute the weather. It must be well known tli-t  the differences of climate under the same latitude and ihe  vicissitudes of weather are not solely referable to (hesitus-  tion that our earth maintains in the ecliptic; the relation thai  tho earth bears to the sun will not account for the sudden  transitions from hot to cold, and from cold to hot, which so  strongly denote the character of our capricious climate  There must be some other cause in operation, some other  agent at work, and the omniscient Creator has endowed our  drop with a properly that qualifies it lo uccomplish all Ihe  changes that we have indicated. This property consists in  its capacity for caloric, in its different states of water, vapor,  and ice, a capacity or property that enables it lo embody within itself, and conceal different amounts of caloric. The  amount of caloric or heat that a body contains, is nol necessarily cognizable to the senses; there is always a eeitaia  quantity that is latent and essential lo the nature of the soli-  stance, and this quantity seems to be in an inverse ratio to  the density of the body. Thus, water may b^ as cold esice  and contain within itself a very much greater amount of caloric than the ice; an excess that constitutes part of thea*  ture of water, anel is called the caloric of fluidity; experiment has proved this difference equal to about M0° of Fahr  eiiheil, and before water of 32° can be converted into ice,it  must part with the 140" of caloric that was necessary lo its  fluid state. A portion of vapor of water contains a vast  amount more of caloric than when condensed into a fluid  form. The liberation of caloric is so great during the change  of water from the state of vapor lo its more condensed fount,  that an ingenious philosopher of this country, has expressed  the opinion that twice as much heat is made free during a  fill of snow as would be given out by the same depth of red'  hot sand. Most persons are familiar with the changes of  temperature produced by the transition of water into vapor or  into a more condensed state. As familiar examples, we may  mention the refreshing coolness that is imparted to a vicinity.  when water has been thrown over an extended surface in  warm weather, or the opposite, a liberation of great he111  when.Water is poured upon quick lime. In the first instance,  ihe conversion of water into the state of vapor, causes an absorption of a great amount of caloric, and consequently pr°-  In  duces coolness in the neighborhood of the evaporation,  the second case, the incorporation of water with the lime.  sets free that excess of caloric that was necessary to it in*1  fluid state, which, by its manifestation, induces a great elevation of temperature.  We have dwelt upon this point, that you might comprehend in what manner water is rendered subservient lo i« 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/526	526	527.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/527.jp2

It is a peculiarity to which vegetation owes its very  existence, for without it the warm regions of the south would  kparched lo barren wastes, and the north cursed with an  eternal and irreparable sterility.  We may trare our drop, filled with the expanding ether  heat, borne high into the subtile regions of the air, there  floating as an airy vapor, or condensed into a fleecy cloud,  now approaching near, and then receding from the earth,  until the chilling current of some northern blast, shall wrest  from it the power that gave it wings, when down to earth  precipitate it falls, to wet the parched ground; to take from it  redundant heat, and be again converted into vapor, and again  condensed, to fall not in the form of water, but as snow in  some northern clime, where it gives out the warmth acquired  in ihe hot regions of the south, and, by another power inherent in ils nature,  protects nnd cherishes the soil beneath it,  restrains the radiation from the surface of the earth, and thus  prevents that diminution of temperature that would be fatal to  both brute and plant.    Here it reposes, until the increasing  heat of the summer solstice, gives warning that its fostering  care is no longer required, and, again imbibing some excess  of heat, resumes once more the fluid state, and, by its soften-  in? power, prepares the soil for the germination of the seeds  that it bad protected (luting the winter; or it becomes a flowing stream, the little ramus of some mighty river, first rippling as a brook, next flowing through a verdant meadow,  noiv swollen inlo an angry stream, it drives its foaming waters o'er beds of lugged rocks and crashing timber; still  gliding onward, it spreads forth into a smooth and placid current, quiet but majestic, and upon its broad bosom bears the  rich products of man's industry, till finally we trace it emptying ils teeming waters into the wide and unfathomable  ocean.   Here it buoys up the leviathan of the deep, or on  lUtranquil surface bears commerce, with her richly laden  ships and overflowing cornucopia, or, perchance, swellin.  inlo rage, as if disdaining to be made the quiet instrument of  man's ambition, it lashes with portentous violence the stubborn shores, and ils wild waves resurge upon each other, and  with impartial vengeance bury whole fleets   in the deep  abysms of its angry bosom.    Tranquility again restored, and  the ebullition of its passions calmed to rest, it is again exhaled  to heaven, and, as a diamond drop floats in the sunbeam, to  paint the seven-striped arch which God set in the sky ns emblem of his covenant with man; or as a cloud of dark and  threatening aspect hangs o'er our heads, with lightning on  its brow and thunder in ils breath.    But these portentous  »gns forbode no evil; for, soon bursting with its own weight,  [I falls down upon the famished and parched earth, to slake  its thirst, and resuscitate the dormant germs that lie scattered  °" Us surface.    Mark it now in the descent, and you will see  II falling upon (hat insignificant and worthless seed, nn acorn  of  mysterious and inscrutable  movements, which, conjoined  with the genial warmth of the solar rays, develope the Intent  and slumbering energies of the germ. These movements  put into action ihe powers of vitality and the seed sends forth  a radicle, and a stem with tiny foliage, whilethe drop is busily passing up and down the plant, now imbibing nutritious  particles from the soil; entering at the root, it passes up the  trunk, administering the different principles held in solution  to the eliminating vessels; ascending to the leaves and evaporating from their surface, ii carries off any excess of heat  that may result from the action of the sun : falling again upon these leaves, imbued with the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, it furnishes a principle necessary to the vegetable, but  njuriousto animal life, and, by this compound action, both  purifies tho air we breathe, and furnishes nutriment to the  plant.  Thus it continues to perform an uninterrupted series of  duty, from the first effort of the germinating principle, until  the worthless embryo shall have become a large and magnificent oak, with its lofty summit reaching to the clouds, and  its wide branches spreading to the wind, beneath which the  birds of the air may find shelter, and the bcasls of the field a  cool and umbrageous repose; while the tough fibres of its  ligneous trunk, furnish a material that may be fashioned lo  subserve the wants of man, from the humble service of a cottage table to the proud ship of national defence. Elated  with success, and proud of the majestic product of its industry, our little drop seeks for some other object upon which to  exhibit the versatility of its genius; from the majestic and  powerful, it descends lo the beautiful and chaste; and first n  parched and drooping rose bud becomes the subject of ils fostering care; expanding into an extremely delicate and subtile vapor, it enters the minute pores of the rose leaves, softens the vessels, dilutes the thickened juices of the vegetable  laboratory, touches the secret spring that sets the whole machinery of vegetable organization into action; and the dying  bud lifts up its drooping head, the verdant calyx grows brighter, the blooming petals expand blushing to the sun, while tho  whole air is redolent of their fragrant breath. Or perchance,  while wandering up and down with charitable intent, it spies  afar the valley's pride bending its lovely head beneath tho  withering influence of the noon-day sun, to which, with  ompt benevolence it hies, and pours ils renovating balm up  on the scorched branches of the fainting lily, gives fresh impulse to the shining leaves, wipes off the arid dust that was  closing up the pores, and snatches the desponding plant from  premature decay. Satiated with beauty and refinement, our  busy drop forsakes the service of these floral queens, and,  while the silent shades obscure the night, escapes, to seek for  happiness in change; but indolence corrupts the fountain of  its chastened pleasures, and, with a bitter spirit of misanthropy, it seeks a refuge within the poison vessels of the fabled  Upas. Here, emulating ils former industry, it sets about con-  coding noxious and naic'otic odors, charms for weirds, and  leadly potions for the doomed. It percolates through every  avenue and hidden recess of its secret labyrinths, until, well  versed in all the mysteries of its new abode, again it seeks the  -' .1.  O  «j*"ii   mill.

Iii  .  patient of repose, makes friendship with (he vine, expands its  vernal buds, sends forth ils spiral tendrils, and clothes the naked arbors with a rich covering-of luxuriant leaves j and when  Pomona loads ripe autumn with her offering of mellow  fruits, within the purple grape hoards up its new-earned treasures. Here it delays awhile, and when the husbandman  would change the nature of his fruit, und turn ils mellow  juices into wine, our little drop again finds occupation. It  transfuses tho affinities that were in play in the grape juice,  and constitutes a new order of combinations, which result in  the formation of a new principle, a curious and powerful  product, which, if employed with rational and becoming mod  eration, constitutes a pleasant and enlivening draught, that an  imatcs the body, calls forth the piquant energies of the mind,  and may be made the harmless and appropriate symbol of a  friendly offering: but if abused, it wields a mighty and a  fiendish mastery o'er the fate of man, who too oft bends the  suppliant knee in servile worship at altars built for human  sacrifice, and there, without emotion, hears tho inexorable  doom, that oceans of bitter tears, wrung from ihe broken  hearts of disappointed hope, cannot avert. From spirit our  little drop returns again to water, and, in their turn, goes  through each grade of vegetable growth, from high to low-  estate, neglecting none, and, with its Protean powers, to each  and every one performing equal duty.  But its powers are by no means limited to that scries of  actions, which appertain exclusively to vegetable organization. It is equally capable of superintending and conducting those combinations of matter which result in the formation of animal structures. From the simple zoophile up to  the perfect and more exalted formation of man himself, every  change of structure, every variety of animal matter, bone,  muscle, the vital fluid, blood, tho brain itself, are all the products of our little talisman. With a spirit of ubiquity, il  pervades each part, and from the first budding forth of vl  tality, until the full development of vigorous maturity, its  unwearied energies are constantly employed. Now it is  conjoined witii that set of vital movements that are devoted  to the growth of the animal; at one moment taking up and  saturating itself with new principles; al another depositing  them in their proper order; again, we see it decomposing  and carrying off' the worn-out atoms of the frame, and in its  turn, replenishing and filling up the wasted vigor of some  exhausted function.  When we consider that man, the self constituted lord of  creation, derives his sustenance from the same source, and is  indebted to the same creative energies, for the. perfection of  his form, the endurance of his functions, and the vigor of his  nerves, as is the little worm that crawls upon the earth and  bites the dust, we must be impressed with a humiliating  sense of our own insignificance, and stand mute with astonishment at the power, which can develope such varied results, with so few and such simple agents.  We may watch the progress of our deop through (be human frame; first imbued with some nutritious particles extracted from the food, it enters the little vessels appropriated  to the chyle and rapidly passes to the heart, where it mingles with tho current of lifo which circulates through every  vessel of the frame; now in the heart itself, it sustel:, .., i  assists the never ceasing action ofthis important organ main  tains its vigor and supplies its wants, while it distributes wilh  impartial diligence the perennial current of vitality. [yM1  drawn to the curious structure of the eye, it helps to fom  and fashion this inimitable instrument, floating in the armi.  lino humors that fill tho anterior chamber of this organ-;,  collects the scattered light-beams that impinge upon the surface and bears them to the lens, thereto be refracted nnd then  transmitted through the vitreous humor, lo be finally arrant  ed with beautiful precision upon the walls of the sensitive  retina, from whence, the optic nerve, with prompt obedience  telegraphs the picture to the mind.    Having thus gamboled  with the light, and witnessed the imponderable fluid beating true portraits of distant and inaccessible objects, it passes  to the ear, and hides itself within the curious labyrinths of  this auditory structure ; here listening to the. din of confused  noises it carefully assigns lo each its respective origin ot  lakes delight in the harmonious concord of soft and mellow  sounds, or forsooth, it listens to those vows that youthful  hearts reciprocate when first the tender buddings of affection  arc bursting into bloom : or when the interest of novelty is  gone, and capricious love's ephemeral life has closed, it  wakes to close attention, and carefully marks down each bitter and unkind reproach, and makes those sounds, thai once  ould send their melodious impulse to tho heart, grate like  the harsh discords of recriminating tongues.  The ever changing susceptibilities of our drop, may successively direct it to every oilier organ of the frame, until it  hall have passed not only through the secondary and subordinate parts of the system, but through the brain itself; here  it watches over the mysterious unity of mind and matter, eliminates the actuating passions of the soul, and is conversant  with the secret agents of the illimitable thought. These  never ceasing mutations may carry it through every link in  the grand chain of animated nature, and if confined to one  individual, in the series, it will superintend every action,  every organ and function, administer to every necessity and  desire; hold equal supervision while the elastic frame of  youth bounds freely o'er the ground, and when the shortened step of after years proclaims a change; preside wbilethe  halcyon days of youth are prodigal of smiles and sunshine,  or when misfortune's lowering clouds o'ertakc decrepitude,  there will it be to make disease more poignant, and in the  active joint, that knew no pain, breed rheum and crabbed  gout. It may mellow the voice of manhood and float upon  the words of friendship or of passion; it may soften the ruby  lip of infancy, and exhale upon the breath of innocence, lo  be again condensed and sparkle ns a tear within the modest  eye of beauty, or sit as an emblem of sorrow upon the wan  cheek of the distressed.  For Iho WoulliWcBlorn Jon'™'  IMITATION.  We often bear it said—by the most superficial observers  loo—that man is an imitative being.    No saying can be moie  true.    It is a maxim long ago established by Aristotle himself, and more and more confirmed by time and observation. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/528	528	529.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/529.jp2

This passion arises from much the same cause  with sympathy- For, as sympathy makes us take a concern  in whatever men feel, so this affection prompts us to copy  whatever they do. Every person seems to have a kind of  ambition to do what he sees others do; especially if it be  something new or strange—something that attracts the attention of community ; and it makes but little difference whether  the acts to be imitated are of a moral or physical character—  whether they bo good or bad. Lord Kaimes has said, that  virtuous actions alone nre imitative. But 1 differ from his  lordship, as I presume every man must who has been but a  partial observer of human nature. If his lordship is correct,  bow does it happen that children—those, too, who have been  brought up by pious parents—secretly attempt to imitate foolish and ridiculous actions which they may have accidentally  seen, nnd using indecorous and unbecoming language they  may have heard dropped from ihe mouths of the vulgar.  Or why is it that men learn to swear so much more easily  lhan they learn to pray.  It is by imitation and observation far more than by precept  and study, that wo acquire knowledge.    There is something  in imitation flattering to the vanity of all.     The great and  the good will always find those who will emulate their examples; and there' are none so mean or so low but they will  find those so servile as will cling lo them, though they wade  through the lowest depths of vice and iniquity.    What is  learned by imitation is easier acquired, and generally more  lasting, as more of the faculties seem to bo brought into requisition in the ncquirement.    Our lives, our conduct, and all  our actions are formed from imitation.    It is a secret homage  which all seem to pay to each other; and it is an homage  which every man qan pay without appearing sycophantic.  Although all men arc moro or less creatures of imitation  yet in order to advance in knowledge and virtue, there must  fce something original: some must venture from the beaten  track, or must find other creatures, or other objects of imitation than man.    And may we  not suppose that nature has  presented him something worthy of imitation.     May not  man's career through the short journey of life be compared  to the Sun,    The sun rises in the morning, and continues lo  thine brighter and brighter until it reaches the zenith; then  gently descending till it comes near the horizon, where its  hght grows softer and softer, until nt length it is enshrouded  in the sable curtains of night.    Thus man commences his  «reer: in the morning of life he is weak and feeble; but he  increases in strength and knowledge until he comes to the  meridian in years und wisdom, when a pure nnd hallowed  light is shed around him, which quickens and enlivens the  whole moral  creation.     Then passing mildly and gently  down the declivities of time, he is forever shrouded in the  n,gbt of the tomb.    And who shall say he has not been a  sun l0 'ho moral world like the sun in  the natural world  Which he sought to imitate.  " is to imitation that painting and many other of the fine  arts owe their  power.    It is to this power that many men  no pains lo improve upon their models. Let us not be afraid  or imitating the example of the great and good; and where,  from the frailty of human nature, wo shall see any thing  amiss,—we have a pattern in Him who went about doing  good, and who never did wrong. And how many men are  there whose lives might be held up as almost spotless examples for our imitation. I would that virtuous actions alone  were imitative, then would our world be free from much of  the vice and wickedness with which it is now filled. But  alas vice surrounds us on all sides; nnd we eagerly follow  ihe multitude to do evil.  The paths of truth and justice are strait and plain, and  unadorned with any false coloring; while the paths of vice  and folly are winding and adorned with all the gaudy trappings of which human ingenuity is capable: the one, with  here and there a traveller, points to future felicity: the other,  crowded with many votaries, proclaims present gratification.  •  V.  Per the Bouth-Wcttern Journal.  Jackson, La., Mav 9, 1838.  Mr.  Editor:  Sir—Your number of the South-Western Journal of April  30th, contains a request that my observations upon some fossil remains found here, should have a place in that peiiodi-  cal. I feel greatly flattered by the request, and hasten to  comply, by sending you a notice as to their nature, and also  a number of the Feliciana Republican containing a lecture  llustrative of the analogies as well as the differences between the elephants and mastodons, together with a short historical notice of both these genera of animals.  The fossils under consideration, were discovered in the  Parish of West Feliciana, upon the stream called Little  Bayou Sara, and not far from the line between this State and  the State of Mississippi. The formation in which these fossils occurred, is that which is known as the blulf formation,  forming the eastern bank of the Mississippi from Baton  Rouge to a great distance up; and extends across the southern Slates to the Carolines nnd Georgia. This formation  also occurs west of the Mississippi, but does not form ils immediate banks, and after passing down parallel with the  course of this river, its escarpment crosses over the Wachit-  ta country, crossing Red River at Alexandria; it passes from  there down the Bayou Bccuf on ils western side, nnd on, in a  circuitous direction to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico.  In this formation, except the superficial layers, there appears to be but few fossils, in sight; and the only vestiges of  fossils are seen in the aslerias, ecrinites, favositcs, fluslras, and  a few shells contained in the rolled quurtz pebbles of tho  gravelly beds.  The formation consists of irregular alternations of beds of  sand, pebbles, clays, and variegated aluminous clays; all of  which vary much in their thickness and composition. The  most recent, or uppermost ofthe beds is composed of a sandy,  or sometimes pebbly clay, of varying color, which forms tho  basis of our soil or vegetable mould.    It is in this last bed  We all their greatness: Demosthenes and Isocrates had their that the remains of the mastodon, and other coexisting ani-  prototypes alio,- whom they copied; and they, even, sparedlmals are generally found: and in it, at the depth of a few  ■ m&  '• ■.■,•■1:;  -I 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/529	529	530.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/530.jp2

The discovery of  tho horse's tooth is important for two reasons, first, because  they were not inhabitants of this continent at its discovery;  but it is more important from its size; as Baron Cuvier says,  that of all the fossils of this kind he had seen, not one of  them would indicate an animal of greater size than the ass  or zebra. With respect,  Your obedient servant,  W. M. CARPENTER  EXTRACT  OP AN ADDRESS  De-levered before llic AMphic Union SociehJ of Williams College, Mass., al llic  Annual Commencement, In August last, b&gt;- Edtcari Everett, Governor of llic  ancle.  • * * The province of education, ill which we may  nil labor, and in which the effects to be immediately hoped  for stand in some assignable proportion to the means employed, is the improvement of the minds of the mass of the people. This is the second question, to which 1 alluded, in the  commencement of my remarks, may not a great increase be  made in the number of those who receive a good education  and may not the education of all be made much better; 1  mean much more thorough and extensive as lo the knowledge  acquired, and much more efficacious and productive, as to the  training ofthe mind? These questions, I am persuaded  must be answered in the affirmative. It is at once melancholy and fearful to reflect, how much intellect is daily perishing from inaction ; or worse than perishing from the false  direction given it in the morningof life, I fear we do not yet  fully realize what is meant, when we speak of ihe improvement of the mind, I fear it is not yet enough considered by  legislators or parents, that there dwells, in every rational being, an intellect endowed wilh a portion ofthe faculties, which  form the glory and happiness of our nature, and which de  veloped and exerted, are the source of all that makes man to  differ essentially from the clod of the valley. Neglected and  uncultivated, deprived of its appropriate nourishment, denied  the discipline which is necessary to its healthy growth, this  divine principle all but expires, and the man whom it was  sent to enlighten sinks down, before his natural death, to his  kindred dust. Trained ami instructed, strengthened by wise  discipline, and guided by pure principle, it ripens into an intelligence but a little lower than the angels. This is the work  of education. The early years of life are the period when  it must commonly be obtained; and, if this opportunity is lost,  it is too often a loss which nothing can repai  tilled this year or the next, although a crop or two be losl tl,0  evil may be remedied.    The land with its productive quali  may  If not ploughed and planted this year, it ,  a loss winch nothing can repair.    It is usual to  compare the culture of the mind lo the culture of the earth. I pampered, self sufficient ignorance  It the husbandman relax his labors, and his field be left  ties remains.  : the year after. But if the mind be wholly neglected during- the period most proper for ils cultivation, if it be suffered  to remain dark and uninformed, its vital power perishes -—for  ill the purposes of an intellectual nature it is lost. It is asjr  in earthquake had swallowed up the uncultivated fallows- it  s as if a swollen river had washed away, not merely the stand.  ing crop, but the bank on which it was growing. When tho  time for education has gone by, the man must, in ordinary  cases, be launched upon the woild a benighted being,scarcely  elevated above the beasts that perish; and all that he could  have been and done for society, for himself, is wholly lost.  Although this utter sacrifice of the intellectual nature is  rarely made in this part of the country, I fear there exists even  here, a woful waste of mental power through neglectof education. Taking our population as a whole, I fear, that there  is not nearly time enough passed at school;—that many of  those employed in the business of instruction, are incompetent  to the work;—and that our best teachers are not sufficiently  furnished with literary apparatus, particularly with school libraries. If these defects could be supplied, I believeafen-  years would witness a wonderful effect upon the community;  that an impulse not easily conceived beforehand, would be  given to individual and social character,  I am strongly convinced, that it behoves our ancient commonwealth, to look anxiously to this subject, if she wishes lo  maintain her honorable standing in this Union of States. I  am not grieved, when I behold on the map the enormous dimensions of some of the new States in the west, as contrasted  with the narrow little strip which comprises the good old  Bay State. They are bone of our bone, and flesh of our  flesh; their welfare is closely interwoven with ours; in every  thing that can promote their solid prosperity, I bid them God  speed with all my heart. I hear without discontent the astonishing accounts of their fertility;—that llieir vast prairies arc  covered with more feet of rich vegetable mould, than oursoil  on an average can boast of inches; and I can bear to hear it  said, without envy, that their Missouri and Mississippi, Ihe  mighty Abana and Pharphar of the Wesl, are better than all  the waters of our poor old New England Israel.  All this I can bear; but I cannot bear that our beloved native State, whose corner-stone was laid upon an intellectual and  moral basis, should deprive itself, by its own neglect, of iho  great counterpoise to these physical advantages. Give the  sons of Massachusetts,—small and comparatively unfertile as  she is,—the means of a good education, and they will stand  against the world. Give me the means of educating my  children, and I will not exchange its thirstiest sands nor its  barest peak, for the most fertile spot on earth, deprived of those  blessings. I had rather occupy the bleakest nook of ihe  mountain that towers above us,* with the wild wolf anil the  rattlesnake for my nearest neighbors, and a snug link school-  house, well kept, at the bottom of the hill, than dwell in a  paradise of fertility, if I must bring up my children in Mf'  A man may protect  'Saddle Mountain., between Wllliamatown anel Aclaiis 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/530	530	531.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/531.jp2

NATCHEZ,  MAY  15,   1838.  OUR JOURNAL.  We owe an apology to the friends and patrons of the South  Western Journal, for the late appearance of the present number; which has been occasioned by the absence ofthe Editor  for the last two weeks, on business.    In making our apology,  however, we feel that our friends and the friends of litem-  lure and science in the south-west, rather owe us an apology  lor nol giving us more support in our good undertaking.  With the exception of lectures read before the Lyceum, the  Editor has had lo depend almost entirely upon his own re-  lources for reading matter for the Journal; while northern  literary periodicals have numerous patrons and contributors.  Why is this?    Is it because we have not got the talenl?    Is  it because we have no resources?    No, it is because we have  not enough of Southern and State pride.    The State of Mis-  (issippi can boast as much talent, in proportion to her population, as any other State in the Union.    She is as rich in  physical resources.    There are many ancient mounds within  Hie borders of the Stale, different kinds of mines, and many  natural curiosities, all of which would afford ample themes  far the antiquarian, the naturalist, and the geologist, and be  interesting and instructive to the reader.    May we not, then  appeal to the friends of literature in the South, in behalf of  their southern pride-, lo contribute theii talents, as well as  their money, to support a literary and miscellaneous periodical,   While we are building up our own importing and exporting commercial ports or cities; while we are establishing  &gt; character and a name in the commercial world; let us not  target the mental and moral world,    It is in vain that we  wish our thousands in building up the institutions of our  Wtintry, unless we lay their foundation upon the proper basis  '" hgbt and knowledge. The perpetuity of all governments,  'swell as ibc peace and happiness of the governed, depends  "Pontile knowledge and wisdom of the people.    And while  *6 are endeavoring to become independent, as far as may be,  111 trade und commerce,—which we believe to be the true  Nicy of every State,—let us endeavor to make ourselves independent in literature and science, and no longer be slaves  a"J vassals to the North.  LYCEUM.  The next regular meeting of the Lyceum will be held in  the Methodist Church, in this city, on tho first Saturday in  June, at night.  Grafton Baker, Esq., of Natchez, has been appointed as  ecturcr, and the Rev. Mr. Steel, of Washington, and the Rev.  Mr. Brunorof Natchez, have been appointed as essayists.  The last meeting of the Lyceum was very well attended •  and we were glad to see the audience so highly edified with  the lecture, and the happy experiments made by Dr. Mcrwin.  Our meetings are always public, and ladies and gentlemen  are always invited lo attend.  We learn that an ancient mound ha3 been discovered in  Louisiana, on the river Bceuf, about eighty miles from  Natchez, said to be hollow. This mound wc think will be  worth examining. We would like further information on  this subject.  For 'lie Small-Western Jciurn.il.  THE INDIAN'S SERENADE.  BY J.   V. SHANNON, ESa.

The bulbul wakes in bis rustling bow'r,  To his love and his lay so true,  He sings to sleep, from bis spray, the flow'r.  Which, beneath him, opes to the dew.  For 'mid the deep there's an isle of palm,  And tbcie, in the cinnamon grove,  Thefire-lly wheels through the bow'rs of balm,  And Ihe wood pigeon loves lo rove.  Thy father's balls arc merry and bright.  And amongst them gay forms now roam;  But what are they to the clear moonlighl  Of my sea-girl island home.  And pearls 'mid [by raven locks shine too,  Gay flowers 'mid thy ringlets stray.  But what are they lo the midnight dew,  That glislens on the orange spray!  And murmurs of song are in thine car,  And around thee mellowly float.

"III'-,  M  1$  ;i|  For the South-Wenteni Joiiriw  DESCRIPTION  „ Tim MKTMobuT antcorcnv CHORCH, ON THI CORNER or iwhiian  AND CAI10NDEI.ET UTIIEETK, IN NEW ORLEANS.  This church, from ils style nnd classic effect, has many  claims to the notice .of every person of taste in the arts of  design. The dimensions of this edifice on the ground plan  nre sixty-six feet two inches, by eighty-six feet eight inches.  The elevation is composed of a basement twelve feet in height,  upon which rests the superincumbent structure, thirty-eight  feet high, to thctop of the entablature, and forty-seven to the  npex of the pediment of the Doric order, and surmounted by  n steeple, in the Egyptian style of architecture, of one hundred feet in height, making the extreme height from the  ground to the top of the steeple one hundred feet.  The auditory is reached by two flights of granite steps in  front, one ascending from each angle of the basement, and  parallel to the front, landing on a platform six feet wide and  thirty-four feet long, from which the pronaos, or portico, is  entered by an elevation of one step, and from thence on to  the floor of the auditory by the ascent of three steps.  The facade is composed of two columns and four antcr, arranged in ihe manner called anlis, after the first or most simple order of Greek temples. The portico is recessed within  the front, and is fifteen feet deep by thirty-four long, embracing in extent two columns and throe intercoluminations.  The columns are five feet in diameter, and twenty-seven  feet high. The antic are attached lo the wall of the front,  which, being in advance of the inner wall of the portico,  forms a space on each side of the portico, in which are the  stairs leading lo the galleries.  Tho entablature is ten feet four inches high, and runs entirely around the building. The details of the order are  from that sublime and unsurpassed example of the Athenians, the Parthenon. The angles of the pediment are furnished with acroterial ornaments of beautiful design. The  crown mouldings of the pediments return a few inches upon  the flanks, and terminate against lion heads, in imitation of  that peculiar feature in all Greek edifices, where there was a  pitched roof, the legitimate purpose of which was to carry  through these heads tho waters from the roof of the temple.  The steeple, being in the Egyptian style, is perhaps, on  that account, one of the most novel and original architectural compositions in the union. It is composed of two square  tapering columnal sections, resting upon a double plinth, and  supporting an octangular obelisk. There are two columns  on each front of the sections, recessed within the face  and between the solid, square-tapering angles. The first  section is in proportion to the. pedestal or plinth, which  makes its columns short and heavy in appearance. Tin re  being no cornice to this section, gives it the appearance of a  solid block with sunk pannels in each face containing columns, which, though singular, is pleasing and in good keeping with the general style. The next section is much more  slender and light in effect, and is crowned with a cornice ornamented with winged globes representing time. The columns arc richly ornamented, and the angles of the sections  finished with arrowhead carved beads—and likewise the  angles of the obelisk, which is terminated by a curved finil  through which passes the electric, rod, layering quickly to a  point of silver, without the usual appendages of a gilt (,,]]  and vane. The basement of tho edifice is in imitation ol  dark granite, and all above of white marble. There is  solemn and chastened grandeur of effect in this buihli,,,,  that reveals its purpose instinctively, and no other idea ran  be associated with it, than that it is a temple dedicated to the  worship of Clod.  A quietness and repose in its appearance, and a harmony  in all its parts, irresistibly attract attention, while every detail  breathes the same bold and noble spirit of case and superior  grandeur. There is no intricacy, minuteness, nor doubt  visible at first sight, but every part strikes the beholder with  clearness and power. It is the only building of the Doric  order in this country.  The basement story contains a spacious lecture room, and  four large rooms for schools, &c. The auditory contain!  ono hundred and thirty-two slips, and galleries on time  sides, making it capable of seating from twelve to fifiern  hundred persons. The pulpit is simple in form and orni  ment, but rich in imitation of marble and sold. Upon each  angle is a splendid candelabra of marble which lights it.  The whole stands within a recess, which is spanned by a  bold elliptical arch, supported by antic, and al! in imitationof  jasper. The coiling is divided into twelve small squarepan-  ncls, and one largo ono in tho centre, which is ornamented  by a magnificent centre-piece. The whole interior is lighted  by gas, distributed by thirty six burners, arranged'around  Ihe side walls, and breastwork of the galleries.  The designs were, furnished, and tho erection of the build'  ing superintended, by those accomplished architects, the  Messrs. Dnkins.  We have lately heard of a new species of fly called the  "Mississippi Guards," which are said to be quite common  in the eastern part of this state. This fly is very useful in  destroying the large horse-fly, which is so destructive to horsei  and oilier cattle in the back part of the state. The guards  ire said to be furnished with u pair of scissors with Avbica  they clip the wings of the horse-fly and thus prevent them  from pursuing their prey.  If any of our friends who are acquainted with entomology  will give us a further description ofthis fly, wo will be much  obliged lo them.

We here insert a part of tho Professor's Lecture:  In my lecture to you on the causes which have acted to  produce the present condition  of organized beings, your attention was called to the stale of the earth's surface, when it  lirjl emerged from the bosom of the ocean ; we saw that it  iras covered for a long time, by lakes, marshes, and savannas,  and that creatures of peculiar types were produced by these  peculiarities of condition.    While  the  earth's surface was  crradually becoming dryer,  there arrived a lime when  its  marshes and wet places were clothed by an exuberant vegetation, of a type peculiar to the localities and temperature  then prevailing; they would   then  resemble the jungles of  South Africa and India, and the savannas of South America  Among the fossils found in the strata which were formed  after this lime, wo perceive the remains of a typo of crea  mrcs, which we would expect a priori, to arise from the circumstances which seem to have existed at that epoch ; it is  that type of quadrupeds, among which arc ihe  Hippopotamus, &C, which are all amphibious.    When the surface be-  came dryer, we find other modifications of this type appearing fitted for other modes of life ; among them we perceive  the remains ofthe elephant, the mastodon, the rhinoceros, the  elastnotherium, the anoplothcrium, and palcothcrium.   Many  of these genera have   become   extinct, as  the   mastodon,  elasmolbcriuin, &c; others have living representatives,though  the species now living, are all different from the fossil ones.  When wo unite the fossil species of this type, lo the living  ones, we form a very natural order, the individuals belonging  10 which, are allied to each other by many and important relations; the most important of which, is the thickness of the  skin, to which the order owes the name of Pachydermata,  which has been given to it.    This peculiar thickness of the  integuments originated primarily from elevated temperature,  which increased tho flow of the blood to it; while the cutaneous transpiration and exhalation   was prevented by the  ;rcat humidity of the atmosphere, and amphibious habits.  Now the dimensions of any organ, will be in proportion to  the comparative quantity of blood employed in its nutrition ;  and ns we havo said that a great deal of blood was sent to  the integuments of these creatures, and none expended in the  way of evaporation, it must have been employed in the nutrition of those parts, and produced in them the unusual thickness of skin.    The great heat of climate, together with ranging amidst the coarse vegetation of the jungles, prevented the  growth of hair.    The animals of this type, which still inhabit localities, and live under circumstances similar to those  that gave rise to it, retain their thickness and nakedness ofthe  'l&lt;in, as is the case with the Hippopotamus, Rhinoceros, and  Elephant ofthe tropics; but when a species inhabits high and  dry regions, or cold latitudes, we find these peculiarities disappearing; we see the horse and hog approaching in external characters to other orders, with thinner skins and hairy  coverings; and the elephants found fossil, in Siberia were  'lad as became inhabitants of the frigid regions of the north.  lo enter.  ary it is our intention  Of the elephants, there are two living species; first, the  elephas Africanus, or African elephant, which is distinguished by having a rounded cranium, very large ears, and molar  teeth or grinders, marked upon their surface in festoons by  the layers of enamel, which are elevated above the bony pun  of the tooth.    The second, is the elephas Indicus, or Indian  elephant, which has the cranium elongated, forehead concave,  ears small, crown of the molars marked in undulating lines'  by the enamel.    These, as their names indicate, are peculiar  the one to Africa, and the other to India.    There is, however,  a third species found fossil in various parts of the world; it  is characterized by an elongated cranium; concave forehead,  sockets' of the tusks very long, lower jaw obtuse in front, molars parallel, very large, and marked by the enamel, in serrated lines.    Bones of this elephant have been found in great  abundance, in every part of Europe; they have also been  found in many places in America; and the Prairie Mainmouth,  ncarOpelousas, took its name from the bones of an elephant  of this species being found there in 180-1, and considered as  the bones of the mastodon, until desciibed by Dr. Mitchell of  New York.    It is,  however, in Siberia, that the greatest  number of these remains have been found ; they are so common in that country, that the inhabitants have forged a story  to account for it.    They suppose these bones and tusks to belong to a subterranean animal, whose mode of life is similar  to that of the moles, but which cannot bear with impunity the  light  of day.    They call  this animal Mammont or Main-  mouth, which according to some is taken from the word Mamma, which in some Tartar idiom signifies the earth; and .according to some, it is taken from the Arab word behemoth,  which is used to designate some large unknown animal; or  from mchemoth, a word which the Arabs usually prefix to  the name of the elephant (fihl) when it is very large.    It is  under the name of Mammunt horns (Mammontovakost) that  the Siberians designate the fossil tusks, which are so numerous, and in so perfect a state of preservation, in the northern  parts of ihat country, as to bo employed for the same purposes  as the fresh ivory, and they make so important an article of  commerce, that the Czars of Russia have reserved the monopoly of the trade.  The fable of a subterranean animal is nol unknown to the  Chinese, who call the tusks, tien-schu-yn (teeth of the lien-  schu,) and have in their works on natural history, descriptions  which they consider as very accurate of a creature of whose  real nature ihey have no idea.  In 1709, aTongouse fisherman remarked, upon the shores  of the frozen ocean, near tho mouth of the Lena, a large  mass in the midst of the ice, whose nature he could not determine. The next year ho perceived that it was more disengaged, but could not yet tell what it was; near the end of  the next summer, the whole flank projected from the ice, as  lid also one of the tusks of some animal. At the end of the  fifth year, the ice having melted rapidly, the whole of the  enormous mass fell upon a sand beach beneath.

He found the animal much mutilated, for the natives had taken much of the flesh to feed their dogs. The  Wild beasts bad also eaten of it, but the skeleton was still en-  tiro except one fore foot. The head was covered with dry  skin. One of the ears was well preserved, and was furnished with a tuft of long coarse hair. The brain remained in  the cranium, but was dried up; the lower lip had been eaten  away, and the trunk and upper lip were also wanting.  Enough of the skin remained to load ten men j il resembled  that of the elephant of India, but had not the brown points  seen on ihe skin of that animal; it was furnislmd with three  kinds of hair; the first, twelve or fifteen inches in length, of  a brown color, and about the size of a horse hair; the second,  nine or ten inches long, and smaller than the first, and of a  russet color; lastly, there was a fine kind of hair about  four or live inches in length, of a fawn color, which  curled up like wool, making a thick and warn layer about  the roots of the other kinds of hair. This animal was a  male, his tusks were ten feet in length, and his head without  the tusks, and with but little flesh, weighed four hundred  pounds. This elephant is now in the museum ofthe Academy of Petersburg. Others have been found in a very perfect state of preservation in the same country, together with  the Hippopotamus and Rhinoceros, all of which have coats  of hair similar to the one described; and they show by the  perfect state in which they are found, and by the thick cover  ing of hair, that they inhabited and died in the country where  they are found after the temperature ofthe climate was nearly as low as al present. The idea that these animals were  washed by currents of water from the south of Asia is thus  shown to be without foundation ; for not only would they d.  compose in being carried so far, but they are all of species  distinct from those inhabiting the tropics.  From the fossil elephant we will pass to the mastodon, an  animal which in size and form resembled the last; it was  provided like it, with a trunk and long tusks, and had feet of  the same structure; the only essential difference between  them, was in the molar teeth; the molars of the elephant, as  we have seen, consist of a bony substance, with lamintc of  enamel passing in a vertical direction through the entire  tooth; and as ihe softer bony substance wears away by chewing, more rapidly than the hard enamel, the crown of ihe  tooili will consist of a smooth surface of bony substance, with  elevated lines of enamel running across it. The molars of  the mastodon to the contrary, consist of bony substance which  is elevated upon the crown in the form of conical ridges or  tubercles, and tho whole crown is covered by a thick layer  of enamel, which does not enter the bony part at all; when,  therefore, the enamel weai'3 away, smooth and concave surfaces of bone, of a lozenge form, are exposed, corresponding  lo the elevations worn away.  The mastodon is the first of the fossil animals that convinced naturalists of the extinction ofthe species. Remains  of these animals bad been found in Europe, with the bones  of elephants, and were with them considered as the bones ol  giants; they drew forth many learned discussions and works,  and it was established with the greatest certainty tjlat n, .  man race was fust  retrograding.     In 1712, Dr. Mathe  a letter to Dr. Woodward, announced the discovery of m-,'  giant's teeth, upon the Hudson River, in the State of Nt  York, mid after this they were frequently found in Arnetic  Unfortunately for these notions, endeared by so many  found treatises, some of the fragments fell into the hands of  turalists, whose way of reasoning being devoid of romance  soon transformed our gigantic ancestors into a form wl 1  they considered as that  of an elephant,    The animal new  received the name of Animal of Ohio, which it bore until  1767, when William Hunter pointed out differences between  the molars ofthis animal, and those of the elephant, with which  it had been confounded.    But this anatomist also fell intoa  two-fold error, for he imagined that to be the same animal ai  the one founel fossil in Siberia, nnd in consequence he called  it Mammouth, thus giving it the name that belongs properly  to the fossil elephant; this name is still erroneously retained  by the English and Americans.    The other error promulgated by Hunter was, that what he called Mammouth must be  from the structure of its teeth, a carnivorous animal, and thai  obtained for the Mastodon the name Carnivorous Elephant■ a  name which  is still less proper than that of Mammouth.  From that time compilers confounded the true Mammouth of  Siberia, which, as we have seen, is a species of elephant, wilh  the mastodon, the pretended Mammouth of America.  In 1801, Mr. Charles Wilson Peale, after much labor and  expense, collected bones for a complete skeleton, and another  nearly complete. They were found in a morass, near New-  burgh, in the State of New York. They were carried to  Europe, and it was from these that Cuvier determined precisely the character of the creature, correcting the erroneous  notions then entertained as to its form, habits and size. Ik  showed that its form and habits were nearly those of the elephant, from which it only differed essentially, in having molar teeth whose crowns were raised into elevated cone-lib  tubercles, from which the name Mastodon is taken, (from  mastos, mammilla or teat, and oe/os, dens or teeth;) and wc  may assume that it had a trunk analogous to that of the elephant, for it could not otherwise have reached the ground,in  its fore legs were long, and ils neck very short; it would also  have been prevented from reaching the ground by long lush",  which projected before it. Before that time il had been considered by some as an inhabitant of the sea, similar, perhaps,  to the seals, morses, or sctacea; but this idea is refuted by  the character of (he feet, which resemble those of the elephant, and are not formed for an aquatic life. In height,  the Mastodon differed, perhaps, but little from the Indian elephant, but was proportionably longer, and its bones wert  thicker. The largest of the skeletons restored by Peak-  was fifteen feet from the muzzle to the rump, and upwards»  ten feet in height. This is supposed to be an individual el  medium size, and is about equal to the common size of In*  larger Indian elephants. The locality of which most &gt;'  known, and which is most celebrated for the number of"»'  bones, is the Dig Done Lick in Kentucky; bul there are many other localities where vast numbers of their remains are  found.

This coincides with what the Camanche Indians tell of immense accumulations of these remains in certain places near  the Arkansaw river, and it is perhaps upon this circumstance  that they have founded tho following tradition. They say  ihat, in times long past, when their remote ancestors lived,  tins animal inhabited all the country as far as was known to  them, and ranged, in large herds, the wide-extended prairies  of the west. As no prcdaccous animal lived that could destroy them, the race increased rapidly, and became so numerous, that they were destroying the pasturage of the bison  and deer, which suffered in consequence, and the game of  the Indian was becoming scarce. The "Giver of breath"  saw this and was angry, and he caused them all to die of a  ..veiling of the throat, (perhaps a figurative expression for  hunger.) In South America, immense numbers of these  ri-inains are found, which have always been considered, by  tho natives and their conquerors, as the bon"s of giants; and  ihe guides point out to travellers the marks of the thunder  which they suppose to have destroyed them.  It is from a similar tradition that a place near Santa Fe d  Bogota, where numbers of these remains are found, has re  reived the name of the Giants' Camp.    Humboldt says, that  there is an immense collection of them at this place, whicl  ii 9000 feet above the sea.  la most cases, thcie is sufficient evidence that these animals died upon the spot where their remains are found, and  ihat they have not been transported by water; for not only  are the bones unworn by water, but the skeleton is often  found in an upright or standing position, just as the animal  sank into Ihe marsh or mud, clay or sand in which it is discovered.    Thus arc found  those of the Osage river, those  mentioned by Deckay and others, and many of those of Big  Bone Lick, notwithstanding the reports given by Bullock  and William Cooper, who report the bones to have been  scattered promiscuously, broken and water-worn; "some of  the large fragments of the tusks of the elephant are worn  quite flat and smooth, as if they had lain half buried in a  water course, and worn down by Ihe action from above." *  It is evident here, that the writers of the article referred to,  were not aware of the fact, that all elephants which have  huge tasks, wear away the under part of them by rubbing  against the earth, rocks, and trees, thus giving them a flattened appearance and a smooth surface below; and this flattening, which took place in the animals' life time, was attributed, through ignorance, to tho wear produced by water  after their death.  No indications have been discovered of tho waters of the  mastodon must have ceased to exist at a comparatively recent  epoch, perhaps since the existence of man, though long previous to his earliest historical records.  There is a tendency in the mind of man which it is necessary to guard against when we approach a subject ol this  kindj it is that feeling which leads us to attribute to mysterious agency, and to consider as beyond the scope of our reason, every effect whoso cause is not readily appreciable to  us. It has caused writers to throw around the existence and  disappearance of the species which have become extinct, a  veil and a mystery that belongs not to them. There is nothing hidden, nothing incomprehensible in the extermination  of species of animals; the Dodo of the Isle of France, has  ceased to exist within the lust century, in consequence of  known causes; the Kangaroo of New Holland, is rapidly  disappearing from the plains where it was once the only representative of the graminivorous tribes; the Hippopotamus  and Rhinoceros are now rare in their own native jungles.  All of the thick-skinned animals not protected by man nre  hastening on to extinction; nor will he, with all his power  and care, be able to save the Elephant from the same impending doom, The mind is prepared, by the contemplation of  such future revolutions, to look for tho signs of others, of an  analogous nature, in the monuments of tho past. Instead of  being astonished at the proofs there manifested of endless mutations in the animate world, they will appear to one, who  has thought profoundly on the fluctuations now in progress,  to afford evidence in favor of the uniformity of the system  unless we are precluded from speaking of uniformity, when  we characterize a principle of endless variation.  K we are ignorant of tho precise causes that operated to  ihe extermination of extinct species, it is because we arc nol  sufficiently acquainted with tho circumstances amidst which  they lived; but we may be assured that they ceased to exist  in consequence of those general laws of coexistence, which  wero given not for the benefit of individuals, nor species, bul  for the universal good.  There are nine species of Mastodon received by naturalists, six of which are indicated by Cuvier.* Others have  also been described by naturalists, but have not been recognized by the best authorities, from suspicions that the differences were not sufficient to authorize the formation of new  sea having passed over the remains of these animals; no remains of Zoophytes or shells have been found upon the  oones or in the layers containing them. The bones are often  found along with tho remains of recent animals, as the elk  and bison. From these facts, and Others of a similar nature  mat might bo produced, wo are led to the conclusion that the  ' Sen Fcalhemonliaugh's Monthly Journal ofGooIoey, No, 0—Article, No-  «»ol nig Uono ,.jL-k, w.

In 1830, Dr. Goilman of New York, (since deceased,)  attempted to form a new genus from some bones ofthis great  Mastodon, and gave to his new genus the name Tetracaulo-  don, from having four tusks, two of which were in their usual place, and two small ones in the lower jaw. But as it has  been ascertained since, that ibis was a mere sexual peculiarity, the genus is no longer recognized.  PRACTICE OP APPLAUDING PUBLIC SPEAKERS.  1 was lately in a city of this Union, where the governor  of the stale, after having that day reviewed a large body of  handsomely uniformed and well disciplined troops, was, at  night, to deliver an address before a Mechanics' Association  1 made one of the multitude, that crowded the immense  Church where the orator spoke.  Various causes wound up my interest to a very high pitch.  The Association was one for the moral and intellectual improvement of a numerous and important class of our countrymen; an object high in the regards of all who hope for  the permanence of our republican institutions. The speaker  was, by general admission, unrivalled in set oratory, among  living Americans—whether we look to grace in delivery, or  to beauty and force of composition. He was the governor  ofaonKAT state (for " The hiwd 's the measure of th  man ;") and here, doffing the robes of civil office as well as  tho gaudier finery of military parade, he, as a plain citizen,  was to address an humble Mechanics' Association upon "the  importance of the mechanic arts lo civilization, and to happiness. " The vastness ofthe throng, the newness of tho people to me, and their being reputed to have some striking peculiarities—raised my curiosity on tiptoe, to see how they  could appreciate what fell from ono of the most accomplished scholars on this continent. And I was equally curious to  see, how he would contrive, without descending from the. dignity of learning or from his habitual elegance of style, to  make himself understood and relished by such an assembly  and by what mode of operation he would work out the design of his address—namely, to impress mechanics with such  a self-respect, as might elevate their conduct and characters,  and impress all others with a just  and salutary  respect f  mechanical pursuits.  The address was, in most respects, happy bevond mv  pectations. But what was my surprise, to find every t»  fine passage followed by thunders of applause, from a law  part of the audience !—hands clapping—canes, feet, umbreb  las, rattling upon the floor! The sobriety of the people—  their puritan descent—tho supposed character of the speaker  —the (supposed) sacredness of the place—had all been to  my mind, infallible guarantees against the appearance there  of a practice at nearly all times indecorous and irrational, but  then and there, hardly less shocking than female drunkenness.  The practice of applauding public speakers, has but lately  begun to appear in the rural parts of the United States.   It  was brought over, some time before the chojora, from Europe;  and was long confined to our cities and large towns, whence  it spread gradually into the villages. Now.it is seen and  heard even in the country—where, one would think, the natives are by no means polished enough yet, for such a refinement to have gotten foothold among them. At first, every  where, it appeared only in circuse's, anel puppet shows; and  in menageries, where that graceful gentleman, Dandy Jack,  astonishes the multitude by his elegant costume, his comely  physiognomy, and his wonderful performances upon a shaggy Shetland pony. Then it passed into the Theatres; where,  however, it was for a long time the appropriate meed of Harlequin, and of such comic, actors as bent their bodies and  twisted their features into the funniest shapes, or sungadroll  song in the funniest manner. At length, rising in ils objects  —from fun, it came to be exercised upon humor; and by degrees also upon wit, pathos, and fine sentiment or fine acting  of any kind.  Those who had witnessed and practised applause at the  circus, puppet show, menagerie, and theatre, sot the fashion  of practising them also towards public speakers: first only  upon the fourth of July, at dinner speeches, and in popular  meetings; afterwards in places where, certainly, those un  civilized rustics, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Jtunei  Otis, Josiah Qiiincy, junior, and Roger Sherman, never would  have expected to see them—in courts of justice, and legisla-  tive halls. There have been repeated instances of loud applause at fine bursts of declamation or keen thrusts of sar  casm, in advocates or legislative orators; at the acquittal el  a popular criminal, or the adoption of a favorite measure  The dignified decorum of the United States Senate has thu  been violated; and the  been thus heightened,  ginia Legislatuie, applauses have been followed by their natural counterpart—hisses. The evil has even shown iWU  on devotional occasions. It is not long since, in a Virginia  village, the close of a rather too animated, controversial sermon, was greeted by a commencing, but quickly suppress  roll of applause: and a few years before, some students ol a  learned university honored a public prayer of their chaplain  with a full peal.  ii ui   un; uiiiie--u   oiucc.3 .jL....... —  : customary disorder of the other House  Both in that Senate, and in the Vir-  It must  be confessed, however, that us this practice  ha)  risen in the subjects of its exercise, it has sunk in the ChM' 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/536	536	537.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/537.jp2

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  ac(er of its practisers: ns it has been applied to more and  more intellectual occasions, this has been done by more and  more ttnintellectual persons: so that, in general, the most violent and boisterous in their bodily manifestations of delight  at any passage in a speech, are those who least understand  Its meaning. They are either ill-taught boys, or men of no  better minds or manners: men, who, like Tony Lumpkin,  ; are never likely to attain years of discretion, or habits of decency, though they live lo the age of Methuselah.  ft is with deep uneasiness, that tho friends to good order  and lo free government havo marked the progress ofthis bad  practice,    It is decidedly mobbish, in its nature and tendon  cies,   Even in the theatre, it often drowns a fine sentence, so  ihat an attentive listener cannot catch its import; and wilh its  adjunct, hissing, leads to many a theatrical disturbance.    Bul  when it appears in a court of justice, or a hall of legislation,  there is cause of serious alarm at the danger to our institutions.   Dignity and order arc essential characteristics, and  indispensable supports, of popular government; and when  they arc driven  from its  very sanctuaries—we may well  iremblo for tho result.    The  process is obvious, by which  the practice of applauding may lead to a tumultuary obstruction of public justice, or of regular and necessary legislation.   Applauso at what is pleasing, naturally suggests, and  provokes hisses at what is displeasing.    Hissed lead to high  words: and these, amongst us, are but a prelude to blows.  When blows begin, either among tho spectators, or between  spectators and officers or members of the house—there is but  o.io stop more to a violent  interference of a mob, with the  proceedings of a legislature.    Surely, no one can hear of  applauses or hisses in the lobby of such an assembly, without remembering, and shuddering while ho remembers, the  17 5  acting a high and difficult part on the stage. But they had  the prejudices, and the vicious taste, acquired by long familiarity with ihat bad theatrical usage; and their suffrage, in  determining the present question, is no more to be regarded,  than that of a tippler is, about tho relative merits of alcohol  anel cold water, when his thirst has become morbid from the  excessive use of strong drink. Admitting, however, that the  physical exhaustion attending the utterance of a long tragic  part, requires the breathing-times which applauses afford—  shall this justify them in the case of an ORATOR—in whom  a ranting or theatrical delivery is proverbially reproachful? '  Ranish the usage then, from all grave occasions of public  speaking; and, for fear of the precedent, from light occasions  also. It were wise, if practicable—and I believe it practicable—to banish it too, from tho theatre, and from every scene  of intellectual recreation or instruction. Its only appropriate places arc the circus, the puppet-show, and the bear-garden.—Southern, Literary Messenger.  Signers of the Declaration of Independence.   Of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence,  it is stated thai nine were born in Massachusetts; eight in Virginia ; five, in Maryland; four in Connecticut; four in New  Jersey; four in Pennsylvania; four in South Carolina; three  in New York; three in Delaware; two in Rhode Island;  one in Maine; three in Ireland; two in England; two in  Scotland; and one in Wales. Twenty-one were attorneys;  ten merchants; four physicians j three farmers; one clergyman ; one printer; sixteen were men of fortune. Eight were  graduates of Harvard College; four of Yale; three of New  Jersey; two of Philadelphia J two of William and Mary:  ml bloody   Parisian mobs, who, stationed in   the three  of  Cambridge,  .England;   two  of Edinburgh; and  jallcry, swayed at will the National Assembly of revolutionary Fran  It is trilling with the subject, to urge that a speaker is encouraged und inspired by applause.    As well might he be  inspired by brandy; nay, better—for it would make him  moro reckless, and bo a less fatal example.    Whoever needs  '■ilher the one or the other kind of inspiration, had better not  set up for an orator.    The best  inspiration will ever  be, a  thorough knowledge of his subject, and deep feeling of the  truths be utters: his best encouragement—glistening tears in  every eye, or smiles on every cheek before him, and the profound, attentive  silence that will reign of ho deserves applause; a silenco interrupted only, if interrupted nt all, by a  suppressed chuckle of delight; and succeeded, when he has  done, by a low murmur of praise and assent, pervading his  audience,    These are the most expressive tributes which an  enlightened auditory can give: the most inestimable, which  enlightened eloquence can desire.    These were the tributes  which Fenelon describes ns paid by an assembly of sages  and warriors, to the goddess of wisdom herself; and to Tel-  einacluis, inspired by her influence.    It was an incense wor-  l,1y of the divinity who received, and of the wise and brave  mLu who offered it,  Mrs. Siddons, and hi  one of St. Omers. At the time of their deaths, five were  over ninety years of age; seven between eighty and ninety ;  eleven between seventy and eighty; twelve between sixty  and seventy ; eleven between fifty and sixty; seven between  forty and fifty: one died at the age of seventy-seven, and the  ago of two uncertain. At the time of signing tho Declaration, the average of the members was forty-four years. They  lived to the average age of more than sixty-five years and  ten months. The youngest member was Edward Rutlege,  of South Carolina, who was in his twenty-seventh year.   He  ived to the age of fifty-one. The next youngest member was Thomas Lynch, of the same slate, who was also in  his twenty-seventh year. Ho was cast away at sea in the fall  of 1770. Benjamin Franklin was the oldest member. He  was in his seventy-first year when lie signed the Declaration.  Ho died in 1790, and survived sixteen of his younger brethren. Stephen Hopkins, of Rhode Island, the next oldest  member, was born in 1 e 07, and died in 1785. Charles Car-  roll attained the greatest age, dying in his ninety-sixth year.  William Ellory, of Rhode Island, died in his ninety-first  year.—American.  Steele says,—" The greatest pleasures  with which the  nave spoken of the necessity of applause, to sustain  ftcd relative Mrs. Butler, both, imagination can be entertained, are to be found in Sacred  them inl Writ, and even the style of Scripture is more than human.  mi  , M  ■ ."•"ill  ' i  •11  Y:i '-  31  'IS  t-'hli  ,i'!i i.  &lt;. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/537	537	538.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/538.jp2

IITHErMOMETErII  Duces.  S.  M.  T.  W.   4  From Mitchell'* Geography.  Natchez, the largest and most important town in the State,  is situated on the east bank of the Mississippi, 300 miles above  New Orleans. It consists of two distinct parts; the lower  town, called Natchez under the Hill, or the Landing, is built  on a dead level on the margin of the river, about half a mile  in length, and from 100 to 200 yards in breadth, and is occupied by ware-houses, tippling-shops, boarding-houses for the  boatmen, &c.; the upper town stands on a lofty bank or bltifii  rising abruptly to the height of 300 feet, and is the residence  of the better class of citizens. The streets are wide, regularly disposed, and adorned with fine shade trees, while many  of the houses are embosomed in groves of the orange, palmetto, and other trees, and ornamental shrubs. This place  has been occasionally visited by tlie yellow fever and other diseases, but is during the greater part of the year an agreeable and healthful residence, and seems of late years to have  lost its character for insalubrity. Natchez is 300 miles above  New Orleans, yet it carries on a considerable direct trade with  foreign countries, and large ships come up to the town. Its  river and inland trade is, however, more extensive. In 1835,  35,000 bales of cotton were shipped from the port. Its population in 1830 was 2790, but at present is probably .1500.  Vicksburg, 103 miles above Natchez, and about 12 miles  below the mouth of the Yazoo River, stands in a picturesque  situation, on the declivity of several considerable eminences,  called the Walnut Hills, rising abruptly from tho river. Il  is surrounded by numerous large and rich plantations, and is  the depot of a large tract of newly settled country, which a  few years since was owned and occupied solely by Indians. In  1835 it shipped off 55,000 bales of cotton, and contains at present probably 3500 inhabitants, having doubled ils numbers  within the last two years. The merchants have commenced  a direct intercourse by sea with the Atlantic ports, and are  making exertions to have it declared a port of entry. All the  trade of the Yazoo country centres in this place. Vicksburg is upwards of 500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, by  tho Mississippi River  T.  P.  S.  s.

S. n. Tiucunn, Esq.  It is hazarding a charge of rashness, and, perhaps, of presumption, to attempt to treat, within tho limits of a lecture, a  labject ihat might well store and enrieha volume, and to bring  to tho task inferior abilities, which should fully engage the  best efforts of minds of the first class. There are, then, two  prominent reasons for a want of confidence, which, with the  charily of a liberal audience, must serve ns an apology for  1   in?, anil my treatment of the subject.  A popular prejudice has over existed against the science of  the law, and its professors have freely shared in the unfavorable prepossession.    At best, many view it and them, only as  necessary evils.    Nor is the world wholly without excuse.  Antiquity, though it lends a sanctity, has added a degree of  mystery to some ofthe early principles of the art, which,  ivbile it augments the toil of the sincere student, offers to the  ill-designing a medium of mischievous misconstruction.    It  is one feature of total ignorance seldom to doubt or hesitate,  and as accident sometimes guides it right, it has, at. least, the  merit of promptness; but uncertainty, and even error, on ac-  f.iiint of the unfortunate conflict of learned opinions, are as  frequently found in the companionship of knowledge as of  ignorance.   Thus credulity is many times more philosophical than skepticism.    -'A little   knowledge,"   it has been  sail, "is a dangerous thing."   Dangerous to a well-balanced  mind,because it produces ambiguity;—to ono imperfectly  cultivated, because it renders it presumptuous.    All those extremes are so many pitfalls in which many lawyers find a  grave betimes, while the unprofessional man of plain, com  mon sense looks carelessly ai tin' mole-hill which tho micro  •topic eyo of the jurist magnifies into a mountain,  Mi,1 science of the law is compelled to combat more physical obstacles.    The obscurity, which envelops many of its  primitive elements, is mainly caused by tho use of an antique  •''"l peculiar phraseology in treatises on ihe subject.    The  Wcient writers sought more to be practically understood than  '' be praised   for the elegance of  their style nnd diction,  «ud, therefore, used tho most familiar words, at the period, in  Wgue, many 0f which, at this day, are obsolete, or their interpretation changed,    Hero is, then, a mass of mechanical labor nnd confusion productive of much  loss of time upon  matters merely technical.    A more modern, and a still more  fist objection arises from the multiplicity of books which fills  H" library ,.f the lawyer, and draws largely on his industry.  "he ingenuity of litigation has surrounded him with innumerable treatises and voluminous "reports of cases" from  whose "distinctions without differences" have grown the  rn:lny subleties which are the parents of the delay and uncer-  lainlyof the Law.  h will be pardoned, 1 trust, if before pursuing the main ob  ject of this lecture, your attention is called to a few observations upon some of these objections, which, it must be confessed, have nn unfavorable nspecl, nnd if I essay lo rescue my  profession from an unmerited reproach arising more from misapprehension than fact.  A prime fault with many is the procrastination, or as it has  been bitterly called, "the glorious uncertainty of the law."  The impediments in the way of a satisfactory conclusion in  a subject almost wholly speculative in its character, originate  Irom the natural distrust that must accompany the examination,  that, in its elucidation, has no help fiom matters of fact.    So  much are we governed by palpable evidences, that a demonstrated theory, although tolhe full as triie.neverobtninsthe confidence that is derived from a practical exemplification.   The  law's delay, therefore, is a corollary of its uncertainly. There  is a conflict of mind, and the demonstration, like a principle  in religion or morals, is a matter of intellectual strife.    And  here a chief obstruction occurs in the imperfection and barrenness of language.    Men's thoughts do not differ so much  as their words, and most honest men, when they come to understand each other, and rightly to  interpret each other's  views, are of one mind.    Most differences are only verbal.  Clod formed our minds, but he suffered us to construct our  language.    All   languages, in common with  human inventions, are defective, and ihe more modern, they are the less  pure, borrowing sometimes from all which have preceded, until, like our own, they become a motley of the rest.    Again,  a fancy for a now-mid unauthorized coinage of words, peculiar to the literary character of our times, nnd especially of  our country, is fast accumulating intellectual confusion for  iterary posterity.    Purity of style may abandon hope, when  each one, at will, can usurp the prerogative of Adam in Paradise, and give a new name lo every thing "in the Heaven's  above, the earth beneath, and  the waters under the earth."  This is the reason why, for so long a period, all legal knowledge was couched in the Latin tongue : This is a language of  chaste, classic difiniteness, and great comprehensiveness, and  from being exclusively the property of the learned, less exposed to the foislerings of vulgar ignoiancc.    Nor  is the  ancient English less deserving of commendation.    There are  many rich old words and phrases, which can bo lound preserved only in a dusty wink on law or philosophy, that are  worth all the new-fangled terms that over fashion had the impudence lo impose upon a civilized literature.    They are the  bone and muscle of a healthy language, and unlike their eha-  melion successors, they have bul ono interpretation, which,  at once, is particular and universal.    Who docs not venerate  the noble phraseology of tho Bible,—the very majesty  of  anguage !    Independent of other claims to his respect, tho  scholar owes it much for having preserved a purity of mcan-  incr to many terms of natural objects, without which ihe anchor  f literature, language, would longago havo drifted into moro  &lt;i *?$  i"    I .  /\ 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/540	540	541.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/541.jp2

There is a guilty heedlessness on this subject  undeserved by its importance. A modern poet, and wakeful  sentinel in the camp of literature, relates an anecdote illuslra  tiveof this incongruity in the use of words, " When 1 first  looked upon the Falls of the Clyde," says he, " I was una  hie to find a word to express my feelings. At last, a man, t  stranger to me, who arrived about the same time, said—' How  majestic ! '—(It was the precise term, and I turned round and  was saying—' Thank you, sir I that is the exact word for  jt'_u.|icii he added, in the same breath)—' Yes, how very  pretty !' " An old writer deserves much confidence as well  as much respect. Authorship was not always a trade, and  then more was thought of the quality than the quantity of  matter thrust into a book. An old book is like apiece of an  cient architecture;—it possesses a solidity nnd strength that  yet admits lightness and beauty, and a simplicity which is the  chief attribute of sublimity.  For the objection lo the multiplicity of law books, though  there are some palliatives, I acknowledge I have little desire  to attempt an elaborate excuse. Il is remarkable that while  in the mechanic arts the ingenuity and genius of modern  man have been exerted to confine the sphere of his eneigies,  without impairing them, to tho discovery of first principle!  and active agents, in order to lessi'n toil or to transfer it to in  animate nature, and thus to emancipate himsell from the  withering curse of manual labor lo little purpose, the re  verse has been the case in the world of literature. In thi  wide range of the manufacturing aits, the motto has been  "Condensation," until the tribute to time and space seems al  must annihilated. But the knowledge that belongs lo ihe  province of literature has become spread over a broad and  broader field, till like a brilliant light it has become dimmer  and fainter as you recede from the parent source.—In illustration, observe the characteristics of the literature ofthe day.  It may be divided into the utilitarian and imaginative. The  utilitarian is limited to such works as the Family Libraries,  Penny Magazines, and periodicals of that class,—cheap literature, appropriately so called. The imaginative swarms upon  us in the shape of novels and romances, purporting to illustrate society and manners, and works upon popular subjects  treated in the same alluring style—light literature, also appropriately so called. Of the latter class there are, indeed,  some which recommend themselves to our notice by their  correct sentiment, brilliant imagery, felicity of stylo and commanding and sublime morality. But this number, in comparison with those which are worse than worthless, is so  small that the risk is too great not to include them all under the ban of proscription. .Such species of reading is the  very intoxicating draught of literature, anel although, for a  while, it lends its victim, perhaps, an artificial and unsubstantial consequence in the eye of society, it is at the price of all  wholesome and practical information, and at the sacrifice of  good taste and of a true sense of real excellence in art or  nature. But tho evil is not content to rest here. Tho subtle  spirit is fast encroaching upon every branch of composition,  however solemn and important, and thus wc find works upon  law, peditical economy, government, and even religion tinctured with this sickly distillation of speculative imagination.  It is the deadliest enemy to truth and sober reason, since I  sides invariably conveying a suspicion of unsafencss a pa  mirror of th,.  licalion of this character is seldom more than a  caprices of the writer's mind. The advice to "reader  thing," may make a ready, but is sure to make a weak mind  Some run into the opposite error, and attach themselves e  clusively to one author. Books are like men,—if we stop  converse wilh all wc meet, we lose the best part of our tim,.-  if wo admit the companionship of but one, we shall become'  like Johnson's Boswell, the mere literary parrot. Literature  can only serve an immediate purpose, when by improvinir  the public taste, it elevates the actual lone of society.  It would seem not to be much in favor of lawyers thnl  in almost the only prominent instance where mention occurs  of them in the scriptures, they appear to little advantage  Wo find one of them, as it is expressed, "tempting" thnSa-  vionr, and endeavoring by artful questions, to confuse lumen  a theological point. But, by the term " lawyers" in the sacred writings, must be understood the interpreters of the religious law, many of whom, by the deceptions they practiced on a credulous people, justly brought upon themselves ihe  denunciations contained in St. Luke. Still, unhappily, there  are many lawyers, in later times, who well deserve a similar  sentence of condemnation. Men who examine and surrey  the laws,  "As rubbers shops and bouses do,  To see where best they may break through."  Who read  the law, as Shylock did his bond, to gratify, in  safety, their malignant passions.  A reproach has fallen upon the law by the very means  which some of ils professors rely upon to secure llieir fame.  The eager pursuit of this study often persuades ils votaries  to neglect others which equally aid and grace the iaiv.  l'hey forsake polite literature and the arts, and an intercourse with polished society, and, in return, acquire a keenness and shrewdness, which, however useful, is but little ornamental. The law, alone, is like a grindstone, which shar  pens but narrows. Literary men, supposing them lo possess  a preponderance of intellect, should not only qualify themselves to be, but, in every material point, actually be, (ore-  most in society and the directors of public taste. A man of  real intelligence should be willing to exchange his contempt  for the world to compassion. It is this scornful indifference  that has abandoned society lo the control of those who are  without legitimate authority, and who hold their commission  to rule only on the fiat of foolish fashion. The true lawyer  should be most the man of tho world. Tho world is lns  constant study. He has to do with ils passions, its interests,  its hopes, its fears, its agonies ! Crime, and folly, and misfortune, he analyzes as the physician scrutinizes a disease-  he penetrates and examines every shade, and coloring, and  degree, until human weakness, infirmity and vice, in then  ghastly deformity, are as familiar to him as a pictured map.  The magician of human life—watch his ceaseless and unwearied efforts, as he searches out every influence thai can  be used upon the sympathies of man—now sporting with™  imagination or arousing tho passions, now remonstrat"1?  with the judgment or appealing to the heart I    Ho wields 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/541	541	542.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/542.jp2

There is nothing in the study or tho practice of the law  which must necessarily destroy simplicity or benevolence of  character. The opposite idea has arisen from the malice of  disappointed clients, who, to protect themselves from the ef-  Itctj of their own improper attempts, have endeavored to  atmse the world with the idea that what they have been de-  lected in or thwarted in, is attributable solely to the wickedness of their own or their opponent's lawyer. The lawyer,  occasionally, proceeds in an indirect manner. The fictions  of the law may require it, and the proceedings, as far as he  is concerned, are compulsory. Let no man suppose that  Providence will interfere in a suit-at-law, on the ground of  his views of justice, separate from religious considerations.  Providence never interrupts the chain of causes, und their  analogies, to produce any specific effect or object. This is  the true reason, however harsh it may appear, which reconciles i.'ie supposed anomaly that the intrinsic justice of his  suit may bo the lawyer's least dependence for success.  It is a recklessness and want of charity that would asperse  the character ofthe lawyer.    Trace him through long years  of study, and mental application to a pursuit, in which the  fascination of ambition, or a zeal for knowledge alone, can  discover a flower—searching, like the entombed miner, in a  rayless world,  for  gems of learning in a "black-lettered"  folio, which a poet of our own day so well describes, as  " That weight of wood, with leathern coat o'erlaid,  Those ample clasps of solid metal made,  The close-pressed leaves unclos'd for many an a;  The dull reel edging of the well filled page,  On the broad back the stubborn ridges roll'd  Where yet the title stands in tarnished gold ! "  Behold his youth and strength poured out like water, on his  toil, over which fancy never casts a smile—the best feelings  cf his manhood jarred by contact with criminals and their  dreadful disclosures, until he sickens al the dark and joyless  picture life constantly holds up to him; and well, perhaps,  may he sigh with the sad poet:  " Now spring returns, but not lo me returns,  The vernal joys my better clays have known;  Dim in my breast life's dying taper burns,  And all the joys of life, with health, are flown ! "  nut there are moments of his career that would illumine the  gloom of the grave, and print joy on  the lips of despair—  moments, when he  finds himself the successful advocate of  virtue and the  triumphant  vindicator  of innocence.    The  world presents no nobler spectacle than that of a brilliant in-  lellect striving in a righteous cause I  With this brief and imperfect defence of the lawyer's good  fame, I commence the main design of the lecture, which is  to endeavor to show, in unfolding the philosophy ofthe law,  now intimately it is connected with human afiairs—with government, religion, morals, business and social life.  Government, logically viewed, is but the mechanism of  the law, the development and application of legal principles.  " Laws," says a learned writer, " are the very soul of a peo-  Ple; "ot merely those which are contained in the letter of  'heir ordinances and statute books, but still more those which  have  grown up of themselves fr  om their manners, and reli  gion and history."    It may be definitively proved that legislation is independent of arbitrary caprice, and history is evidence, that if a law is forced against  the general manners  and common religious views of a people, it must finally vanish or become modified by those irresistible impulses. Hence,  the best legislation is made by a representation, not merely  of the most learned and the most talented, but of those who  best know tho wants of the people and the defects of existing  laws.    The wild doctrine of unrestrained, natural right, acted upon by the French, during their memorable revolution,  was abandoned as chimerical, when reflection had introduced  reason.    As sympathy of manners and feelings, the influence of similar laws, and, sometimes, particular prejudices,  form a people peculiar, it is absurd to argue that a form of  government can be suddenly changed, because such change  requires an hasty and complete rupture of fumiliar and long  cherished ways of thinking nnd  feeling.    Every precipitate  titration which has occurred in the government of any  country, has been of short existence.    Oliver Cromwell formed England inlo a republic, but, when the master-spirit of his  day was taken  from the scene of his singular triumph, the  people', as if by common consent, joyfully returned to their  ancient allegiance.    The Republic of France, in the emphatic language of the scriptures, " was of few days, and full  of troubles;"—it had no foundation in the hearts ofthe people—it was a sacrifice to an idol, falsely called the Goddess  of Liberty I    Yet many believe that the governments of Europe, and especially of Great Britain, are tending to the lc-  publican form, and some alarmists would have us believe ihat  our own is verging on a monarchy, if not a despotism.    The  error lies in false reasoning and unfair comparison.    The  monarchy of to-day is not the monarchy of former times, nor  is a modern republic to be tested by those of antiquity.    Time  has wrought unavoidable changes in the usages and institutions ofthe world; education and the diffusion of knowledge  ave rendered men less dependent and more capable of their  own government, and with the necessity has passed away the  actual authority of the one over the many.    The iron of tyranny is found only in the soil of ignorance.    Mind is tho  only  real sovereign.    It   is  impossible to dethrone intelligence—it once reigned in the persons of a few; it is now the  inheritance of all.    Whatever forms old and fond associations may retain—look not to them alone for the spirit of government, for where knowledge is, there is the power.  Government and law are, therefore, the twin-offspring of  the character and policy of a people. Their joint association in the government of our own country, establishes this  truth. Political knowledge is a republican virtue, and the  privilege of freely commenting both on our institutions and  their chosen guardians, forms the most jealously watched  feature of our liberty. But tho right to reprove or to find  fault, without the ability to weigh tho reasons of either,  would be useless, as the knowledge of an evil, without the  power of applying its remedy, is a disheartening destiny;  thus are found in a republic two powerful auxiliaries of civilization and the advance of intelligence, which exist in far  less degree in other forms of Government.

The  Englishman is very tenacious of his privilege "to grumble,"  and, usually, whatever policy Her Majesty's ministers may  adopt, he boisterously nsserts that privilege. Yet, alas I his  influence, generally, begins and ends in grumbling. This  almost profitless prerogative, however, is more desirable, than  the fate of utter political darkness,—to know suffering by  sight and not byname, to live in such civil ignorance as the  Kussiaii soldier, who, when battling bravely, with the war-  cry _•■ Constantino and the Constitution I "—and beiugasked  the meaning of the term " Consli/ulion," replied, " Constantino's wife, to be sure;"—and would that the Constitution had  had as much authority over the Autocrat as history seems to  think had his wile !

Common  Law is common consent of  l'v It consists of ascertained rules, of general principles,  III, their varied adaptations and applications. The Statute  jynv consists of local usages and principles, and of enactments in-iile fjr tne purpose of modifying, amending or ameliorating the Common Law.  TheReportof the Commissioners, in Massachusetts, upon  i1,.. i ve -di.aicy of reducing the Common Law lo a systematic  ,.,,;., contains great legal learning and research upon this  subject. For the benefit of my hearers, I quote from it, in  preference to burdening you with my own views. " In truth,  ihe (lominon Law is not in its nature and character an abso-  ! itely fixed, inflexible system, like the Statute Law, providing  only fir cases of determinate form, which fall within the letter of tin- language, in which a particular doctrine or legal  proposition is expressed. It is rather u system of elementa-  ivprinciples and of general juridical truths, which are con  linually expanding with the progress of society, and adapting  themselves to the gradual changes of trade and commerce,  and the mechanic arts, anel the exigences of the country.  There are certain fundamental maxims in it, which are never  departed from ; there are others, again, which, though true  in a general sense, are at the same lime susceptible of modifications and exceptions, to prevent them from doing manifest  wrong and injury." Thus, it will beobs'erved, that, though,  in this country, tho old law of England has been adopted, it  ii only to the extent Hint it is applicable to our local circumstances, We have principles unknown in England. For  instance, the right of disposal of real property by a deed of  Iho wife with the consent of her husband, which, in England,  could be effected only by the process called "aflinc or com-  una recovery." The celebrated Code of Justinian was  frami'd iii the decline of the Roman empire, and was formed  from maxims of general experience, of history and reason.  Most of commercial law, comprehending that of insurance  and shipping, and the law governing bills of exchange and  promisory notes, have arisen within the last eighty years, and  Ihe law regulating corporations, within a few years.  But the benefits derived from legislation are worthy of particular notice.    A case, we will suppose, occurs, which is not  ■d 1,  vh,  y any positive enactment.    The first inquiry is.  cedent principles. The principles of natural justice have  furnished many rules for the exposition ebf the contracts and  obligations of the parties; the analogies of the common law  have furnished others; the usages ofthe mercantile world  have furnished others; and then again there have been anomalies which could not be brought within the range of any  well defined principles, and therefore have been left to be  regulated by legislative enactments."  'Ihe real influence and deep philosophy of the law are  found not alone in the halls of justice and in the volumes of  jurisprudence, In the one, perhaps, is seen the course of  justice overtaking a solitary instance of crime ogainat society, or the determination of a disputed question of the right of  properly, and in the other, maxims of legal or political learning—but go abroad into the world, nnd you shall see them  there in every shape, wielding a power before which the  mightiest bow in reverence, and lo which the weakest look  up with confidence. The criminal, though panoplied in steel,  shrinks before the avenging arm of the law, and environed  by its protecting hand, the naked anel sleeping infant is an  armed host I Wander whithersoever you will,—in the crowded city or the tcnanlless desert, on the cloud-capped mountain,  or tho pathless ocean,—it is with you in every relation and  circumstance of society or of life, lo punish or protect. It is  this that reduces virtue to a system, and forms a code for morality; this that enforces what duty commands, or prevents what  religion repudiates. Though there is, I believe, a natural  and inherent desire and lovo in mankind for virtue,—still  unsupported and unencouraged by an executive power, its  efficacy is frequently lost in the confused whirl of human,  passions, or the anguish of human sufferings,  But I find myself fulling into the error of all who write  upon a favorite subject. Many will say that I have gone only from mountain to mountain in the field of my subject,  where the glory of the profession ever gilds it, without daring to penetrate and expose the secrets of the dark valleys  which lie between, where, as in a well, the real truth and  philosophy of the law are hidden. They will remind me of  iho professional pride evinced between Moliore's dancing-  master and menial philosopher—"Ah, sir," says the first,  philosophy is ono thing; but the danse, Monsieur, the  dansc!"    Or they will refer mo to the lawyer's celebrated  whether it comes within the scope of any fixed rule of tho|critici&lt;im upon Shakspeare. " 1 own," says he, "I never pe-  common law, or can bo brought undor it by analogy. If rused ny chief favorite, the Merchant of Venice, without a  lot, and it cannot bo met by the principles of equity, relief mixture of melancholy, to think that it has so many faults,  and, in particular, that the distress turns chiefly upon embarrassments with which no lawyer can seriously sympathize.  There are several striking flaws in this drama. In the first  place, Antonio's difficulties arise entirely from his gross oversight in not effecting an insurance upon his various argosies.  He should have opened a set of policies at once upon the  Rialto, where marine insurance was perfectly well understood, and where the brokers would have got him fifty names  in a forenoon, to any extent, upon ship, freight, or cargo, lost  or not lost. This prudential stepwould have given a totally  different turn to the whole affair. When he wanted to help  Bassanio with three thousand ducats, for three months, he  tan onl\- be had by new lerjislation, to act as a guide in siin  "ai'eases iii future. Before tho reign of Queen Anne, of  England, promissory notes, though payable to bearer or older, were not considered negotiable, so that none but the pay-  foeoubl bring suit upon them. "This, therefore, was a case,  Where, though tho principles of natural justice might apply  10create an obligation, the positive rules of the common law  forbade it. Hence tho interposition of the Legislature became  '"dispensable. As soon as the negotiability of promissory  "lies was thus established, it gave rise to iminmerable ques-  ''ons, as to tho rights anel rcsponsibilitiesof the parties, which  &fe either confessedly new, or but faintly indicated by ante-  .

Shylock says ol  security of an assignmen  ' Antonio is a good man, yet his means are in supposi-  argosy bound for Tripoli, another to the  him  tion : he hath an   ,  Indies; I understand, moreover, upon tho Rialto, he hath a  third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he  hath squandered abroad, But ships are but boards, sailors  but men ; there be land rats and water rats, water thieves and  land thieves; I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of  waters, winds and rocks?' Now these are the very risks  which tho contract of insurance is intended to cover, as clearly expressed in Marshall and our other writers, and as express  ed in the following clause inserted in all policies; to wit:—  1 Touching the adventures and perils which the assurers are  content to bear, and to take upon them in this voyage, they are  of the seas, men-of-war, fire, enemies, pirates, rovers, corsairs,  thieves, robbers, jettisons, etc., barratry ofthe masters or mariners, and of all other perils, losses, and misfortunes, that have,  and shall come to hurt, detriment, or damage of the said  goods, or said merchandizes, and of said ship or said vessel.'  With this precaution, Antonio's means would have been no  longer in supposition, but in certainty, and as good as hard  cash, under deduction merely of the premium of insurance.  Finally, when intelligence was received of Antonio's argosies  being wrecked, it is plain that he might, undor the circumstances, have at once abandoned to the underwriters, and  claimed for a total loss. It is painful to see so many amiable  characters in griefs and difficulties, which this simple and natural expedient would have obviated. My feelings at this  reflection are something akin to those of a very susceptible  medical friend, who declares that he can never sit out Romeo  and Juliet, from the thought that a judicious use of the patent  stomach pump, in the last scene, would remove all distresses,  and make two lovers completely happy."      »        •        •  For iho Snutli Wentorii Journal.

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  ,lcr being in the affirmative, my shivering applicant for ad  mission, conjured mc in " God's name" to get up, and speed  my way to Thornhcdge Lodge, where I was expected anxiously by Col. Perryan, whom he had left a half an hour  previous, in despair of his daughter's life. Confused and  half asleep, I hurried on my clothes; my vest inside out, my  pantaloons reefed above my boots, and with my cap wrong-  side-before, I mounted the messenger's horse, having previously strapped on my portmanteau, and at full speed wound  my way to the Lodge, three miles distant.  I met the Colonel nt the hall door, who greeted me with—  "glad to see you, Doctor," and with a countenance that illy  accorded with his salutation, ho " begged me to walk in, and  as soon ns possible to repair wilh him to his daughter's apartment. Upon coming to the light, for the. first lime I noliced  the ridiculous figure I cut, owing to tho hurry of dress, and  with a remark upon the " extreme coldness of the weather,'  before the Colonel turned round, I buttoned my overcoat  f|'iite to the stock. Having reached the centre of the room,  and thinking it time to uncover, in the midst of a speech of  condolence', which I intended to finish with a bow, I made  three successive efforts to find the visor of my cap, but without eflect, and like a country urchin who enters a school  room for the first time in his life, I grasped it by the crown,  hauling it down over my face, when the Colonel's gaze of  astonishment at my silly appearance, disconcerted my speech,  and 1 stammered out the remainder with a bow so low thai  my boots met my eye one red-top the other white, and gap-  in? about my left leg so widely that I could not get my pan  laloons over-it, In the fulness of mortification, I perceived  I had drawn on one of my room-mate's boots, and with what  I intended for a smile, grinned out hurry as an apology for  not having paid some attention to my toilette. The Colonel  smiled me into self-complacency, and the effort appeared so  great in his then slate of mind, that I forgot my laughable  entree', and anxiously requested him to show me to Miss  Clara's room.  0 Frank ! thank your stars for not having embraced my  profession, unless wilh the feelings of Zeno, you could witness the heart-rending scenes to which a physician is often  subjected.    They have caused mo many times to regret that  I ever opened a volume which  treated upon the science of  medicine, and I assure the feeling was never feigned.    Bul  the subjoined case  will give you some idea of the melancholy task which   sometimes unavoidably kills to the lot of  our profession.    With my portmanteau in  one hand, I fol  lowed Col, Perryan across the hall; he opened the door op  poske, and having both  entered, a single sweep of the eye  'old me that I was indeed in the abode of grief, while from  every quarter of the partially lighted room, there came the  (instilled wail of heart-rending sympathy for the fair sufferer  Who lay in the other corner of the apartment, the subject of  hysteria.    At the moment I entered, for the first time in my  'jfei 1 realized the deep responsibility attached to the practitioner of medicine, for 1 had no sooner lisped forth a gener-  ■1 salutation, when with a simultaneous movement, the mem-  *« of the family crowded around me, and with tears and the  "lost feeling supplications,  implored me not to  leave the  Lodge till I had arrested the terrifying paroxysms. With  the assurance that I would exert every effort in my power to  relieve Miss Clara, "I entreated them to be calm, as I thought  her illness was more frightful than dangerous."  Allow me, Frank, to introduce you to a portraiture of my  patient when enjoying perfect health, and under circumstances when intellectual superiority alone could have empowered her with the electrifying influence she exercised over a  literary cotery, of which I was an honorary member. Three  months previous, Clara Perryan was the centre of attraction  at an assembly of this chosen circle which met in the evening at Professor A's residence, where, prior to having mixed  with the group, I had an opportunity, unobserved, to admire  the fair creature in all her loveliness. Fashionably attired,  her rounded form did not lose its symmetry, anel seated upon  a piano stool, her person from temple to girdle, rose above  the rest, as if her apparent superiority received the tacit acknowledgment of those around her. Her eye, which seemed the " throne of expression," sparkled an assent to the  rhapsody which George Herbert was at that moment pouring forth in his usually happy strain, upon the influence of  music on the feelings, regretting at the same time "that ho  was insensible to ils charms."  " You are at home on the delightful effects of music, Mr.  Herbert," observed Clara, "anel if I did not run the risk of  being charged with flattery, I would add, that you are no ordinary master of that accomplishment upon more instruments  than the one behind mc ;" pointing to the piano as she spoke.  " Indeed ! Miss Clara," rejoined he, " while I appreciate  your compliment, allow mc to observe, that I am extremely  careful not to jar the nerves of my friends after you have entertained them on that instrument, nnd believe me, my execution upon others, will not allow me to be perfect on any."  " I was not angling for fulsome praise, modest Oeordic,"  replied Clara, and the blush on her cheek (which seemed a  glowing emblem of the vestal deity thai throbbed within her  bosom) had  not yet taken  flight, when with animation she  continued, " your illustration, Mr. Herbert, struck me so forcibly that I could not but think, that you were either not a  Stranger to the pages of a certain legend which tell us how  the enthralling strains of "AnnotLylo" subdued the outbreak  of feeling so often engendered in the bosom of Ihe morose  Allan McAuley, or that your boasled stoicism had yielded  to the melting  influence of a love-dilty, perhaps  from the  coral lips of some pretty inamorata.    No, Geordie, I spoke  my honest conviction of your skill, and your observations  upon the sympathetic alliance between music and our feelings accorded so truly with what I experienced but yesternight when the operatic company honored our residence with  a serenade, that I would have assented to your doctrines with  my prettiest courtesy, but that your effort to plaister me with  a little crude adulation, face-to-faco, precluded the possibility."  ' However," added Clara, " we will not quarrel about this  natter, and if you will promise never again to make such a  drive at my vanity in this circle, I will make you a present  as publicly as you make the promise."  Herbert, who had been writhing with a clouded brow under this playful bilterism, again looked at case when she con- 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/546	546	547.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/547.jp2

He had scarcely finished  when Clara left her seat, took from her in ok a small pink  riband, looped a bachelor's pin-cushion on the little streamer  and with mock solemnity placed it about Herbert's neck, enjoining him to wear tho badge of his blushing honors a fortnight. Amidst the simpering of the group and ihe incontinent pecavi of poor George, she quietly seated herself nt the  piano, and in a serio-comic manner executed the old fashioned air of " 0 dear ! what can the matter be ? "—accompanying the instrument with her voice in the most ludicrous style.  Here, Clara was all life, all gaity, and those around her  seemed to catch the spirit of her humor, whilst I stood aloof  watching the rapid change of her beautiful features, the  sparkling witchery of her laughing eyes, and admiring the  grace of her every motion as she ran her snowy white fingers  over the keys of the instrument without seeming to touch  them.  How changed was the scene when professionally called to  see her! Before me lay the writhing form of this fair girl,  and her whole system in such violent agitations, that the constant efforts of the mother were required to keep her in bed.  Her eyes rolled about wildly, were completely unsettled,  and so devoid of recognition, that a single glance told me,  with the paroxism she was laboiing under an aberration of  intellect. 1 was satisfied of this fact when I took my station  at the bedside, as an incoherence of speech which escaped her  pallid lips in broken sentences, and the startling effect of the  soul-damning cause which grated upon my ear, as in her  wildness of speech it revealed itself, convinced me but too  painfully that her affections had been abused, her hopes of  happiness disappointed, anel that the apparently amiable  George Herbert, with all his blandishment of manners and  versatility of talent, possessed a heart so inhuman that he  could trifle with the noblest feelings that adorn the female  character.  " Hah" I exclaimed tho unfortunate girl, as I took her Indie wrist to examine her pulse, " where is George?—do you  come  here to feast upon  my disap ? the letter I—lie  loves me not I—be still my heart !—0 villain I—villain I   mother!—mother I—why do you not burn the le— ah-h-h,  you here Doctor" ! !! Willi the last exclamation she throw  herself violently to the back part of the bed, gnashed her  teeth, deracinated her hair by handfiills, and then with an appalling shriek that went like a knife to my heart, leapt from  the bed, anel in despite of all our efforts fell prostrate on the  floor. We raise:! her up and replaced her in bed after much  exertion, for her strength during the paroxysm almost bid defiance to restraint, and tlio irritation produced by a bruise received upon her temple when she fell, increased her frenzy.  Her father and two sisters held her whilst I compelled her to  swallow the fourth of a grain of morphia, and it v.asnot Jong  before her muscular contortions abated. 1 ordered a foot  bath or warm water before 1 left, anel was gratified to witness  this simple remedy relieve the brain of too great a determination of Wood to that organ.    Her exanguious features soon  became mantled in scarlet j her extremities grew Warm • h  skin became suffused in a gentle perspiration, and when I  left tho room she slept calmly. It was immediatelysil  breakfast that I mounted my horse, and was about to ride oil'  when Madam Perryan hailed mc from the hall door ami'  wished to know "when I would repeat my visit?" I replied  ihat I would return at 3 o'clock, P. M. of tho same day, ?M\  perceiving that she had something to communicate, I asked  her if she "had any message for tho village?" she answered  in the negative, but added a request that I would remain  silent upon ihe unpleasant cause of Chun's illness, dividend  unconsciously whilst she raved upon the subject of her un.  happiness." I assured her kindly she need not be under any  apprehensions, that I should be so imprudent, and having requested her lo renew the warm fool-balh for Clara, (if upon  waking Symplons of mental alienation were manifest) 1 bid  her good morning and bent my way to tho village.  For the first lime since I left Clara's apparlmciit, I had, nsl  rode homeward, an opportunity to reflect upon the scene 1  had so lately witnessed) and aware that rumor gave it out  that Herbert and Miss Clara were soon lo be married, tho  idea that he was now revenging himself upon her, for llic little ruse de. guerre she indulged in at his expense on the evening of the party at Professor A's, three months previous,  Hashed upon my mind as quick as thought. 1 remembered  too, of having heard Herbert exclaim, aside, on that evening  that "she should have u Roland forhei Oliver yet;" but did  not deem him callable, at that time, of hurling at the very  fount of her happiness, his envenomed shafts of vindictive  ness. Handsome, well-formed, and graceful in the extreme,  George Herbert was the possessor of a brilliant mind, well  itored with polite literature, and it was not unnatural that Clara should become.pleased with his attentions, and eventually  lo contract an attachment for him, which, with her, would  prove no child's play passion, as her attachments, even in  friendship, were of the most lasting kind, whilst her enmity,  when unjustly provoked, slept not.  I reached my office, and during the day could not drive from  my thoughts tho circumstances connected with the case on  hand; and an intimate acquaintance with Clara's constitutional temperament, induced me to fear a return of paroxysms  so soon as the soporific effects of the morphia she had taken  hould go oil'. I therefore paid a litllo more attention to my  toilet, having figured so ridiculously in the morning, ami  galloped off to the bdgo, where 1 arrived at half past two  o'clock. Upon entering the sitting room, I found all of the  family around the lire but the mother, and, after an exchange  of salutations, ventured to inquire after my patient.  "She did nol awake till one o'clock," replied Mary, "a'"1  win u she did, her unnatural exuberance of spirit and laughter at her own folly, for half an hour without intermission,  followed by a low brooding melancholy, which still «""''  ueies, keep us in constant fear of a return of convulsions.'  " Did her laughter sound natural, Miss Ma  •y'l  " 0 no, sir!—it appeared so at first; but before she relapsed  into this gloomy thoughtfulncss, from which she soinetiiues  wildly starts, her laughter was so hideous, that my father,  unable any longer to listen to it, left her apartment.   w'nc" 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/547	547	548.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/548.jp2

Alary had scarcely finished speaking, when, in the most  melancholy strain of voice, the following stanzas reached our  cats:  " I-, there some spirit sighing,  Willi sorrow in ihe air,  Can weary hearts be dying,  Vain love repining there 1  If nol, then how can that wild wall,  Osad jEuli.ui lyr :l  He drawn forth by ihe wand'rlng gale.

" Good Heavens I " cried Mary, " 'lis Clara I Doctor Melmoth, can ibis bo the premonition of returning sense, or is  ihat doleful melody but another maniacal ebullition from my  poor sister?" The affectionate girl burst into tears, as I  ell her "it was one of the singular phenomena that attended  Hysteria." " Your sister's mind and feelings," I continued,  'have received a severe and unexpected shock-; her whole  nervous system is disordered, anel being of a full habit and  tanguine tempi rament, this singular affection is the result. 1  wish, however, the united efforts of you all, to aid me in re  Soring Clara's health nnd intellect, and as soon as I attend to  her immediate want of medical assistance, I hope you will  correctly observe the line of conduct I shall lay down, to be:  exercised towards Clara, and very soon, perhaps, we may  witness ils salutary eflect." I left the sitting room and crossing the hall, entered the apartment of my patient, finding her  in tears, and sobbing most pitifully, whilst the alleviating cf-  fals of her kind mother were being exercised to assuage her  diseased grii f. She was in a silting posture upon the bedside; herleet were immersed in a vase of warm water, and,  'villi her fnce buried in her hands, she wept, without noticing  my approach.  I bowed to the mother, and asked Clara how she was. She  started upon hearing my voice-, and seemed astonished that I  Md found my way to her bjd-sidc unobserved. " 1 am very  "ell," she replied, " but why make the enquiry? I have but  a slight head-achol " Without answering, I fell her pulse,  "10, finding it somewhat quick and irritable, I asked her if  'no would allow mo to take some blood from her arm; adding  'hit il would relieve her head.

"I will do as you wish," I rejoined, and having bound up  ''« arm, I let about eight ounce's of blood, with the injunction  185  and, immediately after ii, to administer a moderate dose of  camphor. She appeared quite rational after blood-letting,  and satisfied that nothing more was needed nt the time, I was  about to leave tho room, when Clara observed enquiringly,  —"You will return to the Lodge to-morrow morning?"  "At ten o'clock I will be here," I replied, and bid her "gocel  evening." I found i|„- re mninder of th, family in the sitting  room, anxious to know my opinion of Clara's illness, and  having "told a flattering tale," requested "that she should  nol be bit alone; that c.he orfulness and a li, Iy t mo el' conversation must be observed by every one ol the familyin her  presence, and that occasion-illy readingaloud to h 'r something  light and amusing would hive a very beneficial tendency!

They  were engaged in the attentive and anxious discharge of the  duty they had engaged to perform, from half past eight in  the morning, until six o'clock in the afternoon. They ascertained that the number of pupils connected with tho institution during the past year, is about seventy-eight. These are  arranged into four classes, and designated Primary, Sophomore, Junior and Senior.  The Primary Class is under the instruction of Miss Colton.  The number of pupils connected with it is about thirty.  They arc generally little children from five to nine years of  age.   This class was first subjected to on examination.  They had been taught spelling, reading anel Bible History, together with the elements of Arithmetic and Geography,  There are two rules  adopted  in every department of this  |    Institution, which are considered by the Committee indispen-  I   sable to all sound and successful instruction.  The first rule is, to reduce all science to its simple elements  and most obvious principles. And the second rule is, that  first principles must be thoroughly understood, before the  pupils are allowed to engage in the study of such as are subsequent, dependent, and complicated.  By a rigid adherence to the first rule, a knowledge of the  most abstruse anel difficult subjects is rendered comparatively  easy, even to the infant mind. This truth was recently exemplified in the instruction of little children in the principles  of .Music, by Mr. Johnson in this city. It was also fully apparent throughout this examination. Adherence to the second  rule, confines the operations of the mind to real, substantial,  primary and important subjects of knowledge', until ihcacqui-  sition is made, and prevents superficial and imaginary acquisitions, which may possess all tho beauty of some of the pass-  lag visions of the night, or of the clouds, with their endless  variety of forms and colors, which sometimes adorn the western sky, but leave iho mind as barren as the arid sands of  llic desert. The eflect of an adherence to these rules was  fully evident in the examination of tho little children, who  constituted the Primary class. The Committee observed  with pleasure, that, at this early period, they have not only  acquireel a knowledge of spelling and reading, but also of  the elements of Arithmetic and Geography.  The method of instruction adopted, is such as gradually to  unfold and invigorate their intellectual faculties; and they  learn to think and understand, whilst they are acquiring positive knowledge of important subjects. The teachers in this  institution are greatly aided in carrying out their system, and  in adhering to their favorite rules, by the great improvement  in modern school books, which have actually rendered that  Possible and easily attained, which was deemed generally  impossible.  The next class, which is under the instruction of Mr. Bru-  ner, excited, in many respects, a high degree of interest. It  consists of about twenty little girls, from nine to eleven years  of age. Tho committee wero exceedingly anxious to sec  whether the intellectual faculties of these little pupils were  capable, even under the new method of instruction, of analyzing and comprehending the principles of the higher  hrar.-H-is of science, to the study of which they had been in-  ic name  c promising appearances  ) enquiries awakened a  troduced. At the last examination, they were without a name  I hey were then told that if they would study well, and deserve a name, they should have one, as well as the two higher  classes.    In the report of the Committee at their last examination, ,t was said,    " They promise soon to occupy the high  position now maintained by the Junior and Senior Classes"  Whether these liltlo pupils had actually conquered the difficulties of tho sciences with which they had ventured to grapple, and secured a triumph ; whether they deserved th  to which they aspired;  whelhe  had become a reality; each of these  lively interest and some anxiety in the minds of th'o Committee.    They were consequently highly gratified with the  developments of the examination.    They saw with pleasure  that the proficiency of this class in Arithmetic, Geography,  and English Grammar, so far as they had gone in these several branches, bore ample testimony to the zeal and industry  with which they had pursued their studies.   And their examination on Natural Philosophy, embracing ihe properties of  bodies, and the various kinds of attraction and  motion,  rendered it evident to the Committee, that, notwithstanding their  age, they were well acquainted with these difficult and abstruse subjects, so far as they had progressed, and that they  were emulously treading in the footsteps of the higher classes.    The examination of this class of pupils exhibited to the  Committee, in a most interesting point of view, the ability of  their teacher, the zeal, industry, and success of the pupils,  nid the complete triumph of the system of instruction pursued.   These pupils indeed do richly deserve to be dignified  with iho name of Sophomore, to which they have aspired,  and for the attainment of which they have so faithfully and  successfully labored.  The Junior and Senior classes are also under the instruction of Mr. Brunei-, anil arc composed principally of young  ladies—there being about twenty connected with the former  and eight with the latter.    The study of English Grammar  had been continued by both of these classes and completed by  ihe Seniors.    These two classes have pursued the study of  Natural Philosophy together.    The examination in this department of science embraced the properties of bodies—attraction, motion, hydrostatics, hydraulics, pneumatics, acoustics, optics, &c.    Besides the usual mode of examination by  pieslionand answer, several of the young ladies were calhd  upon to present their views of some one of these subjects in  a continuous manner—somewhat in the form of a lecture.  In every instance, this exercise was performed without hesitation, and the subject was defined, explaini d and described by  accurate and appropriate language, in a manner concise, lucid and satisfactory.    In Chemistry, the Junior Class was  examined on Caloric, Light, Chemical Electricity, and Galvanism, and Chemical Attraction and Affinity.    The examination of the Seniors embraced not only these subjects, but also about one-half of the whole course in Chemistry, as pre  scnted by Dr.  Comstock.    In addition to this, the Senior  Class were examined on the first six books of Colburn's Algebra.    And it is expected that they and some of tho other  classes will soon add to their other acquisitions a knowledgo  of the Latin language.  r; 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/550	550	551.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/551.jp2

In the examination of [lie Sophomore class, the Committee wero surprised and delighted in contemplating tho evidence before them of ihe fact, that minds so young, and especially femab) minds, could be made, by means of the new  method of instruction, to comprehend the preliminary principle's of the higher blanches of science. In tho examination  of the Junior and Senior classes, there were further and fuller devel ipments. These young ladies had travelled the  same path which the Sophomores wero travelling, but they  now had attained and were occupying a more elevated and  commanding position. The reality of their attainments  was fully evident. They fully understood the subjects upon  which they wero examined. From their perfect familiarity  with tho whole of the subject, and tho readiness and accur.;-  y of their replies lo every question asked by the Commitl  Tho Committee noticed, with both interest and adm'  tion, the peculiar kind of government which the Prineinnl  has succeeded in establishing.    It is truly paternal and th  too of the most aflecti6nnte and efficient kind.    Th™ „„,,  as ono united, harmonious nnd affectionate family,    qu  teachers are kind, conciliating and affectionate, but  e is generally excluded.

They had exhibited capabilities of com-  ■ ■ what tiny had begun—capabilities of acquiring a  e of the whi I • circle ofthe higher branches of sci-  e,    i.l of taking their scats among the best educated ol  i n  .. in the land. The Committee are not only prepared  id i]: tho language of the report of the last examination,  1.-  ,, "We have not attended an examination in any school  :ollege in the United States, where we have witnessed a  :   accurate and thorough knowledge of tho subjects to  the examination extended," but we would also say  . the institution has no1 Iy held on its course    It has fully  ified the fond anticipation of its friends.

In the musical department, under the instruction of Mrs.  Bruner.tho samostrict adherence to the two favorite rubs ol  the institution, is carefully observed. The Committee were  favored with several pieces of music, both by young beginners nnd also by those who had attained a high degree of  knowledge and skill, Although tho late indisposition of  their amiable and accomplished instructress prevented her  from bestowing so large an amount of labor upon her pupils  as she bestowed upon them during the former session, anel  which she hopes lo bestow upon them dining the next session, yet the progress which they had made, and their evi  dent accuracy anel skill, boro ample testimony to their own  talents and industry, and to the superior ability, splendid attainments, and untiring energy of their excellent instructress.  command.  ing.    The pupils arc familiar with their teachers, affectioi  ate, respectful, obedient and happy.  The Commitlee also observed with pleasure, the professior.  n! enthusiasm of the teachers, and also their success in communicating il lo their pupils.    The communication of know.  bdge by the teachers, and the reception of it by the pupils  seem to aflord &lt; njoyment of the highest kind to both, so ihat  instruction nnd study are no longer a drudgery, but rather a  delight.

Knowing the fecundity of the valley of the Mississippi in  Indian antiquities, the American Antiquarian Society has  ever had an eye lo the west and south-west—eagerly soliciting all authentic information in relation to tho numerous and  powerful tribes, whose thousands once trod the vale of the  Rather of Waters," and whoso traces of power still exist  in Ihe imperishable mounds which abound in our vicinity.  How much the desires ofthis distant society, expressed  through the communications of its secretary and librarian,  have contributed towards forming the determination in our  cinityto investigate, by actual examination, the subject of  Indian antiquities, it is not for us lo say—although wo would  gladly wish iho same influence could reach every section of  our country, where an Inehan mound or tradition still lingers.  On the 18th of May, 1838, a parly of literary and scientific gentle men proceeded from Natchez to the river bottom  g my entire satisfi c-|b„twcen lhc ,,,.,,, nm, ,,„. ,,.,.,,. of t|u, Mj8sissjppi) nbol)t lhrcu  I believe that great credit is due nnd „ Jla„- miles bolow [ht, th    fcf ,hc     ^ rf mmin  ''I ing two square mound,, that rise from eleven to sixteen feet  above tho bottomon which they are based. The mounds are  nearly a mile from the river, and about one-eighth of a mile  from tho inland bluff. They stand twenty-three perches apart,  ranging,north and south with each other, the larger being  four perches square, and the other half that size, and five or  six feet less in height.  An excavation was made in the centre of lhc smaller ono  to tho depth of eleven feet, through aluminous earths, evidently heaped up from the surrounding surface, At thin  depth were found the indisputable evidences of river depos-  lites, an 1 indications of haling reached the river level. Numerous pieci ; of Indian pottery were, found, while digging  to that depth. As the mat -rials of bolh structures were similar, no excavation wad made in the larger mound.  A river bottom lake is now in existence, about two hundred perches north of the se mounds, and probably once overflowed the plain on which the mounds are now found. The  supposition is, that these mounds, once surrounded by water,  were places of refuge to which the mound builders retreated  to be more secure against surprise in time of war—the waters  of the lake serving as a fosse, and the mounds as ramparts.  Had a rampart alone been the object, the adjacent bluff would  havo furnished one more lofty, yet less inaccessible.  On the 28th of May, ten days subsequent, a larger company of gentlemen, about twenty-live in number, repaired to  the great mound in Selserlown.  The distance of this mound from Natchez is about ten  miles, bearing east north east. The road is the one leading  to Fayette through Selsertown. Leaving the village of  Washington, and passing the residence of W. P. Mellon,  Esq. on tho right, a mile and a half from the latter placo  brought the company in view of the majestic mound, lifting  its warlike bastions and tower in broad outline about a mile  to the left of the main road to Selsertown.

It is now grown  up with tiees, and has the appearance of a deep gulf worn  by the water. Gentlemen who examined this chasm, fifteen  or twenty years since, were firm in the belief that it had  been a subterranean passage. The longer chasm from the  north side of the mound is approached by a similar one, although shorter, from the southern side.  It was most pleasing to an investigating mind, to witness  the deep interest exhibited by the gentlemen who composed  the party of exploration to tho mound. The subject of In  dian antiquities is one connected with important results, and  none are so capable of giving duo attention to the subject, as  those who reside in the vicinity of such remains of by-gone  years.

Tho progress of  science and literature at the West, is a subject of peculiar  interest, and it is gratifying to receive such favorable speci-  m''iis of the public spirit and talent which will ensure its rapid advancement. It is to be hoped that Southern and Wes-  'c"i Antiquities will have a fair share of consideration in  your Journal, as much that is important and interesting might  undoubtedly be developed by the attention of persons so well  situated and qualified for a scientific investigation of them.

"As we approached the latitude of Sunday's island, the  poor fellow's anxiety anel impatience became painfully intense. During the ten days we were cruising in ils neighborhood, he could scarcely cat or sleep, and while it was daylight, was continually aloft, looking out for land—most generally in the slings of the fore topsail yard, leaning with his  back-against the topmast crosstrecs, in which position 1 have  known him to sit for four hours, steadily gazing on the horizon ahead, and apparently absorbed in deep mi dilation ;—  and he would announce " a sail," " land," " green water," or  a "canoe coming oft]" long before we could see the same objects from deck, with our best glasses. We finally made his  island early in the morning, before he had yet left his berth ;  and when Captain Morrell told him that his island was in  sight, he started from his bunk—which was the top out of  three in the cabin—and fell prostrate on the floor, being in u  sound sleep, having turned in but one hour previous. After  recovering himself in some measure from the sudden surprise, and rubbing his eyes, he exclaimed, in his broken English—"What for you loo much afoul, Captain. Morrell?  You. no see my island! and suppose me. no see my island, me  no like you too much I" With this speech, he instantly came  upon deck. It was a beautiful morning, and almost a perfect  calm. The smooth sea shone like a polished mirror, and  the sun was just peeping above the horizon. I think it was  one of the finest mornings that I had ever seen, which is saying much, after a cruise in the Indian Ocean, in the month  of Octob 'i-, a vernal season in this latitude. A ruin squall  had just subsided, leaving the decks wet, and the morning air  cool and refreshing. The rigging was studded with sparkling drops of dew and rain, which shone like pearls and diamonds in the light of the rising sun, and gave the shrouds  mdslaysa most imposing appearance; and, as that splendid  luminary attained a greater elevation, the atmosphere in the  vicinity of land,became thick and cloudy, with the evaporation from the recent shower, and the heavy dews which invariably prevail in these latitudes. But the morning mists  were soon dispersed by agendo breeze, and unveiled to our  view tho beauties of this "land of promise"—the goal for  which we had so long toiled was now in sight, and tho mo-  ■•■ ;■' i  /  A 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/554	554	555.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/555.jp2

"  Published liy Hlnmandi Dntlon, Philadelphia.   1838.  Within a few years past, Mr. Augustus Mitchell has presented the people of the United States with some of the finest  .&lt; lecimens of map engraving which have been issued from  the press. The numerous maps which he has furnished,  have been gotten up with great neatness and beauty; and  what is more important, they evince much research to insure  correct delineations of] the different countries he has mapped;  as he always introduces the most recent changes in the divisions of countries; and the courses and distances of rivers nnd  mountains, which the latest discoveries in geography have  In  and the small scale upon which it is necessarily drawn  most instances these are laid down with more precision, and  may be referred to with more satisfaction, than many maps on  a scale ten times as large. Throughout the great oceans  are distributed the transcripts of the compass, with all its ordinal points; bywhich, in a moment, the bearing of one point  from another may bo ascertained, by applying a common  rule or straight edge. This arrangement, together u lib th.;  minuteness with which rocks, coasts, islands, and straits, and  the tracks of navigators, are laid down, must lender it u valuable map for the cabins of ships especially.  Wc are inclined to believe, it would have been better to  have given a slight shadingto ihe bounds of seas, bikes, and  oceans, by the engraving.    This might have been done with-  brought to our knowledge.    The map of the United States out any inconvenience, and would have made the boundaries  published in I83§, was a fine specimen of engraving, and a  very true delineation ofthe region embraced in the United  Slates and Territories. However there were some few errors in that, especially in tho map of the Stales of Mississippi and Louisiana; but of so trivial a nature as scarcely to de.  of land and water more distinct: which ii- ihe plan adopted  by most modern map-makers. Whereas, in the presentcuse,  there is only a single black line, shaded on on,' side with  paint for the seas; which, al first view, is apt to occasion a  little confusion; and this liability will increase after a few  Krvepointing out. It must doubtless be extremely difficult years, when the paints will, in n great measure, have baled,  nl a distance to obtain exact information of every village and so as lo leave only the single black line, as the division be-  lown which arc almost daily springing up in the great valley tween continents and oceans,  As to the different portions of ihe map, we believe there  are none more deserving notice than others; but all merit our  approbation and encouragement. A mere passing notice of  each quarter of the globe is all we can bestow at present.  NeiiiTii America. This map is rendered doubly interesting by the discoveries of Captains Parry and Back, which  of the Mississippi; anel of the numerous water courses  which are annually discovered and explored, as the advance  of the white settlements extend over the vast wilderness.  which has been gradually reclaimed from wild beasts and  ihe savage tribes. Hence we are almost surprised, in these  regions, to find the information so correct in these particulars,  ami so correctly spread upon the maps,    in the present map, are carefully attached, together with the variations of the  even the recently recognized republic of Texas, wilh exact needle, in the various points of longitude in those arctic re-  boundaries, and the towns which have sprung up in a few  months, arc all laid down in a conspicuous manner.  fho present publication is even a work of more merit than  Ihe map of the United Slates, because it embraces such a vast  amount of research, anel such a great extent of surface; be-  "i? no less than the surface of the whole terraqueous globe)  With all its continents and subdivisions, oceans, seas, islands,  mid llie various trucks of voyagers who have circumnavigated  We globs.

This  part of the map, like all the remainder, is most handsome ly  executed, and the delineations very correct.  Although the scale is comparatively small, wc were pleased  to see the Mississippi traced to its ultimate source in Itasca  Lake. This has as yet been given on very few, if any, general maps. Mr. Mitchell has nol, however, improved tho  buok accompanying the map, to the same stage of discovery:  for by the discoveries of Mr. Schoolcraft in 1832, which place  the source of the Mississippi in Itasca  Lake, one hundred  tate, must have required intense application and much re- and eighty-two miles were added to the previous length of  search. , the river above the falls of St. An'.l. my, which before was es-  The general plan of the Map deserves a short notice.

In  Mr. Mitchell's present work, he gives the descent of the  falls inn] rapids for ten miles below at seventy-four feet, whereas Schoolcraft, in IS32, by a moro correct observation, ascertained the entire descent, including sixteen and a half feet of  perpendicular falls, and the rapids for half a mile below, nl  forty feet; and the rapids in the next eighteen miles down to  St. Peter's river, do not exceed twelve feet, or eight inches  per mile; making a total descent in eighteen miles of fifty-  two feet, including the perpendicular falls of sixteen and a  half foot.

In spreading out the  great extent of the Russian tertitory, it slill leaves lhc country of tho bravo Poles with a name; although they have  been deprived of their liberty and polilixal rights. The  Mediterranean sen, with the populous rcgionsaround it, iscon-  opicuoii3ly laid down, with the fine islands by which it is  chequered.  Asia is more minutely laid down than common; and the  map designates iho different regions occupied by the different  races of men, who people thnt immense continent. The interior of that continent, especially the regions inhabited by the  Turcomans, the Kulmuks, Mongols, Tartars, and Samoieds,  nre de signaled on the plan of Multe' Brim.  Africa is no less well executed, and contains the most  recent discoveries in relation to ils interior unknown regions,  and the sources of some of the large rivers which lake their  rise in the mountainous regions of the interior. The Niger,  or Cluorra, is laid down in accordance with the discoveries of  Richard and John Lander, Slill a large portion of its course  is rather problematical. The map exhibits more correctly  the countries of the coast around, und of the interior: for  which we are mostly indebted to Malle' Brim's maps of Africa.  Toe most interesting portion, however, is embraced in  ii .inns of watery wastes,speckled by  ids, solitary and remote, or grouped  into numi rous classes: This division or classification was  first m i le by Milte' Bran.

It has n copious consulting indi &gt;.. for pointing out the spot upon the mop where  any town or o|her locality may be found. This is very Con-  venient to those who are not familiar with the particular locality of cities und countries upon the map; and even foi  those who arc w. II versed in gi ography, and who may occasionally need some assistance in ascertaining the location ol  strange cities and places.  As a frontispiece, there is a map containing the color" unil  emblems of nearly all the flags of civilized nations ihroimh  out the world. This is quite an interesting map, and merited  more care and attention in the painting than it has obtained,  The typographical execution of this volume is neat end  plain, and such as will please all; if we may except the  "black lines" around the margins, which would not so certainly please all parties. It may nol be in bad taste" but it  evidently must remind the two great opposing parties in'tali  country, of an occurrence in the Senate ofthe United Stutc?  which, in ils different and opposite stages, was equally obnoxious lo both. We feel confident, however, that the publishers  did not, by these lines, intend lo sustain the views ol either  party, or intend them to have any bearing whatever upon tho  mere act ol "expunging'1 in the abstract. The matter contained in this volume, is probably as correct as that of any  similar work.  Our attention has been drawn particularly to the chapters  upon the States of Mississippi and Louisiana, in which w»  find a very correct nnd condensed synopsis of the physical  geography and statistics, with two or three, exceptions, which  areas follows; viz:  1. Mississippi. This Statu is staled to have an "average  length of three hundred miles." In tlii3 he follows Mr,  Flint almost verbatim ; and may be correct, as the distance  between 31* and 35? north latitude, the extremes ofthis  State on the. river, is about two hundred and eighty miles,  and the south-east corner, which is about fifty miles longer,  and as wide, would probably make the whole State average  three hundred mihs in length : but Alabama, which lies the  same nnithern and southern limits, is given at two hnnilriel  and eighty miles long. Another error has been admitted in  the same way, from Mr. Flint: The direct length ofthe  State ale, lg the Mississippi river is given at three hundred  anel eight miles, which is just seventy-seven miles to a degree, or nearly eight miles too much for every degree. In  this distance he says the river has a serpentine "course of near  seven hundred miles," which is very erroneous; for the  whole distance by the river from the mouth of the Ohio lo  the thirty-first degree of north latitude, is only about seven  hundred and twenty-five miles, nnd of this distance about su  ty miles of the river border Kentucky, and nearly one hundred and forty on Tennessee, so that there remain only five  hundred and ten miles as its course opposite the State of Mississippi ; previous to some cut-ofls, it was five hundred and  thirty miles. Tho crop ofthis State is given at 31)0,003 baits.  of cotton: yet the crop of 1S3G was about 350,000 bales  One or two small errors are observed in l cl .tion to Nalehiz;  one of which is on page 20;"&gt;, where he says, "many of lhc  houses are embosomed in groves of orange trees," &c. "I&gt;ls  may have originated in the laurica mundi having been mis-  taken for the orange. The orange tree will not stand the  winters nt Natchez, unless protected from the cold.

In  the mean time, I should be pleased to hear from you, and if  you do not receive answers to your letters, think not that it is  because you have lost my friendship.    Will you be kind  enough to drop this letter in the village post-office?

" 1 have no desire," I rejoined, "to hold up a mirror from  which may be reflected a single fuult of yours, yet much as  I admire your proud spirit of independence, I liar, Clara, this  passion of revenge, which now feeds upon you, will, if you  arc not careful, prove n tyrant that may master vour better  judgment, al a time when most its free exercise is needed.

" Farewell, then, my fair friend, and remember that to adhere to your resolution of becoming cautious, is indispensable in entering the field wilh one whose knowledge, of artifice renders him a dangerous enemy.—I wish you all the  enjoyment, Clara, this trip can possibly afford."  With my llianhs, Melmoth, allow me to assure you I heed  your injunction,—farewell! "  Having taken leave of Clara, whose strange admixture cf  feelings rendered her an enigma that the future only could  solve, I joined the family in the next room, und, after partaking of refreshments with the Colonel, returned to the village.  Time rolled on: business soon began to call my attention  "Sir:—Your unexpected note arrived at the Lodge during  my illness, and I havo nol been able to notice it till now.  U;'on its contenls, I have no comment to make, further than,  that you being the preserver of your "honor," you should not  'cse sight of that line of conduct which would keep it unsullied.

Several weeks had passed,  and not having heaid from my itinerant friends, I sat down  and wrote to Clara, registering such incidents of interest that  had transpired during her absence, and closed'with a "word  to the cautious." A month elapsed after I mailed this letter,  and still I heard nothing of her, except through Madam Per-  yan, who informed me that they would visit Havana before  they returned home. When I had censed to expect a letter, I  took from the post office a packet, which I know from tho  post-mark, must be either from Col. Perryan or his daughter.

I-., i ir,  Having shut myself up, I soon became deeply interested in  the following document:  " Havana, Isle of Cuba, March 14, '31.  "Dn. Jon* Mia.MDTii!  Dear Sir:—Here I am in this beautiful island, a blighted  mass of moving nature, longing for the moment when death  shall close these eyes upon a world of trouble, and I may be  permitted to yield up a life that has proved indeed a burthen.  We have been here a fortnight, under tho hope entertained  by my father, that this shattered frame of mine will again assume the vigor of health, but he little thinks the Haltering  disease which now preys upon the very citadel of my existence, must sooner or later destroy me. How lo describe the  scenes I have gone through ; portray the passions that have  well nigh wrecked my reason, and reveal the too successful  plan of my unholy revenge, without sinking at tho task, I  know not; bull promised to do so, and it shall be done.  Nothing of interest transpired after I left the Ledge, till I  reached Cincinnati, where we spent a week in noting the  beauties ofthis fair "Queen ofthe West." Having witnessed all the novelties of this city, my father engage d a passage  to New Orleans for us, on the steamboat Mediterranean. We  embarked on the 10th of January, and suffering from an attack of influenza, I did not leave the ladies' cabin to dine in  common, until we reached the mouth ofthe Ohio. The din  ner hour was 2 o'clock, P. M., and I left ours for the main  cabin, on tho arm of my father, taking my seat next to him  at table, without allowing my eyes to rest long enough for  recognition upon the features of any of the mam'gentlemen  that crowded lo llieir seats. Whilst dinner was being served  up, there was a medley of conversation all around me, none  of which interested me, except that in which some genlh men  opposite were engaged, upon tin- subject of painting. I Us-|iscTme that ? "  toned, however, without raising my eyes, until an appeal was  made by one of them, to his next neighbor, upon the point of  disputation. The gentleman referred to hud no sooner uttered half a dozen words, than my knife fell from my fingers  upon the plate, making quite a noise, whilst f trembled most  violently, for 'twas Herbert's voice that struck my ear, and as  I glanced in the direction of the speaker, my eyes assured  inoof tho fact. He was looking in another direction at the  moment, and ashamed of my weakness, which fortunately  was not observed, I studied an indifference, in which I succeeded, I fear, but illy. I rose from ihe table soon aflcr, and  being obliged lo pass Herbert, our eyes met, he bowed, und  with a recognition on my part, 1 fli d to my state-room.  Secure from observation, I revolved in my own mind u  thousand vyiles.with which to hire him within my grasp, that  I might then rack my brain for an invention to torture this  heartless man. I almost imagined him powerless within  my reach, and, 0 Melmoth! iho savage exultation which  thrilled through my heart at that moment, was like a benison  to my soul. Beveling in this thought, I was disturbed by a  low tap at my door. "Come in," said 1, and Miss Alice  North, who had embarked at Louisville, entered with—  "Good evening, Miss Perryan, I fear I am intruding on vour  and if ive can accommodate ourselves to this little  coop, »c  pint  may manage to while away an hour that might be j  more tediously."  " Do you know, Miss Perryan," said my pretty inquisitor  the gentleman who sat opposite to me at dinner?" andde  scribing Herbert's person, added, "I allude to the gentleman  who was appealed to, and gave his opinion on painting so eloquently to the disputants? "  " I answered in the affirmative," and enquired, " what thera  was in him to attract her attention ? "  " O he is such a handsome fellow ! and do you know, his  eyes were constantly upon you while al table, and when you  left, he gazed upon you as though 'twas his last look upon a  much-loved object."  " Come, come, Miss North, do not be silly," I replied, without betraying any further notice of u piece of information  which encouraged me in my unhallowed design upon bis  happiness.  " What is his name, Miss Perryan '? "  " George Herbert."  "My brother," she returned, "bus invited him into the la-  dies' cabin, alter tea, to introduce him lo us, but would nottcil  mo his name, which you must know is one of Harry's many  provoking tricks, but—"  " Hold !—your brother's humorous disposition has served  to break the monotony of ibis long und tedious passage, anel  I will not hear him condemned unheard."  " 1 will tell him that you said so," replied Alice.  "Nol if you value my friendship, 1 quickly added, "for  'twos nut intruded for his ears."  "As you will; but then we shall have vour company tonight, win u Herbert and Harry come info our cabin—prom-  privacy ?  " Nol at all," I replied, "for I feel the want of company  " Certainly, as you are so urgent!  This gay and happy girl then left my room to change bei  dress for the evening, whilst I, for the first lime in my life,  studied how I should make myself "irresistible," as the vain  of our sex would say. Dress after dress was thrown aside,  and being dissatisfied with my whole ward robe, f wore ihe  plain morning dress 1 had on; paid some attention to my  hair, loaded my cars and fingers with jewelry, and fell dim  I could play the flippant. The bell announced tea, and ray.  father being upon the boiler deck, Mr. Henry North banded  me to the table. Henry for the last two days had paid nw  much attention, and ut table made himself very agreeable,  the which I desired, and played tho "stricken" when I thought  myself observed by Herbert. I conversed freely wilh him,  and upon subjects of which I was mistress, I dilated as eloquently as 1 knew how. 1 had been contending for a point  with Henry for some time, and during the colloquy, became  much animated and deeply interested; excited, I pressed my  arguments upon him till he sued for peace, and then, by u  glance round the table, I perceived that I had drawn upon  me lhc gaze of all present.

"Say you so? then indeed I am blessed, and if you will  teach me how I can—"  " Listen I—'tis tho boats' bell for departure—we must re  turn."  We hurried on board, and once more in my state-room, 1  turned the bey on myself, resolved lo ponder well cu the line  of conduct I should adopt for the future. Melmoth, at this  juncture of aftuiis I wavered in my purpose, and imagining  that Herbert deemed himself really justifiable in addressing  me; that cruel note at the Lodge, on the ground that 1 was  tho first aggressor, I thought his humility, his awful protestation to Heaven, and his impassioned desire once more to  hold a place in my affections, were the stiongest evidences  ho could oifer, that he had repented, and being willing at the j  altar to pay me the highest respect man can to woman, I  deemed it a crime in tho sight of my Maker further to pursue my revenge. Indeed, when I left my room, it was with  the determination, if he should continue worthy of my love,  to share with him the ills of this life. But alas! ibis gleam  of hope, cherished more for his icdemplion than my own  happiness, was soon to be dissipated by the knowledge of a  fact which rendered his asseverations an hour previous, the  fi.u of ids own soul's condemnation, When I returned to  tho ladies' cibin, my father was waiting for me, and wished  me to join him in a walk upon the after-guard. No sooner  than alone, "My dear Clara," said he, "how is it that you  are again the associate of that unprincipled wretch Herbert,  iii'ier what has transpired between you?

However 'nil desperandam'  is my motto, and whilst it shall urge me on, ' modest Gcoidb,'  as she once termed me, will 'stoop to conquer.'  " In haste, yours truly,  "G. H."  Shocked at the great moral depravity revealed, and the  base perjury established against the writer, I felt more  like sinking into my grave than returning to my father. I  at length summoned strength of mind enough to do so, and  found him still upon the after-guard, alone, bul in tears. All  my father's kindness from infancy rushed upon my recollection, and regardless of tho place, I clung aboul his neck,  kissed the tears from his aged cheeks, and wept upon Ilia  bosom lii.e a child. Some lime elapsed ore he loos.d himself from me, when he enquired, what reply ho should  make to Herbert's suit?  Without answering immediately, I asked him if he would  place every confidence in a pledge I would make, never to  marry the apostate.  "Tis all I ask of you, my dear child! "  " You will not prevent me from adopting my own measures of riddance, though you may sometimes think I intend  to break my pledge?"  "I will not!"  " Then tell Herbert, when he calls on you, that you leave)  the whole affair to my judgment; that I ought to know what  is right, anel that you will acquiesce in any course I may think  proper to puisne.

"OGod," I involuntarily ox-  claimed, " whore shall I look for relief from my unparalleled sorrow but in death?" "Here!" exclaimed my cousin  Isabel, who hail been watching over me with a sister's care,  and was concealed from my view by the folds of .tapestry  which curtained tho recess in the window.

In the fulness of heart evinced by my cousin, 1 forgot my  woes for a time; and, locked in each other's arms, we wept  without restraint. Feeling a warm current of liquid reach  her arm, through her sleeve, Isabel raised up to ascertain the  cause, and suddenly exclaimed,—"You are bleeding at the  arm, Clara, where the Doelor opened a vein an hour since,  —see you have burst the bandages—what shall I do?"  "Call my father," I replied, and was coolly holding my  thumb on ihe orifice when my father hurried lo my bedside,  the very picture of grief and despair. I felt a reproach from  his careworn visage, which words could never have caused,  and buried my face in the pillow from very shame. Haying  bandaged my arm, "Clara," said he, " look up my dear girl,  and till me if you are better? "  " I am better," I replied, without raising my eyes.

Fearing a settled disease of her lungs, and knowing ihat  the West Indian climate would provo more favorable to a  healthy resolution where phthisis was not confirmed, I immediately wrote to Clara, enjoining tho necessity of remaining on lhc Island through the summer and coining winter;  advised moderate exercise, anel by all means, lo avoid exposure to the heavy dews. If she had returned lo the north  at the time first intended, the vicissitudes of weather would  hive proved too trying upon her lungs, and hei numerous  friends would have been obliged, without doubt, to have  mourned her early loss.

Wc readily comprehend  that, in Europe, such mailers would be viewed with jealousy  and'apprehension by Government, and indeed by nil in  Church and State, who are attached by interest, prejudice and  fear, to existing forms and institutions. But in our country,  where religious bigotry and superstition, political tyranny  and persecution, are unknown ; where the People ore and  own and do every thing, the progress of Society is among  the greatest of popular interests, among the highest of popular duties. The advancement of society in religion—pure,  humble, enlightened; in knowledge—practical, useful, benevolent; is then an obligation laid upon every man by the constitution of our state of sociely; and above all on those whom  God has endued with talents, has blessed with opportunity  for their cultivation, and has honored with the authority of!  public stations or the influence of private example,    'f  insensible to these truths, is not to realize that every man, [stop, till he rests in that calm sunshine, a premonition of tho  however elevated or lowly, is one of the people, nnd that he peaceful rapture of tho seraphs—these that we most love to  of events is here implied,    Mind, in ils progressive dcvel  ments, is the subject-matter, and events are but the mnnifesta  lions, the exponents of this Mind.

His life was as full 01  follv as his writings are of wisdom, and he might be said to  have exemplified one of his own sarcastic, observations that  there are some persons who give away so much wisdom,  that they seem to have none left for their own use; or the yet  more important remark of John Foster, thnt the efficiency of  of Truth itself depends entirely upon the communion ofthe  soul with the God of Truth.  His principal work "The Lacon," ihat which is most in-  dissolubly associated with his name, and is the fairest index  of his character and nbilities, is one of tho most remarkable  productions of our age, ll is a Hook which only the wise  rvill read, and only the profound can comprehend, Its title  declares it "addressed to those who think." It is an intellectual mine where' every thought is a diamond of the keen-  est edge and of the purest ray, and where giants may work  with their pickaxes and still leave it unexplored ; and yet he  who created this mine had nothing in keeping with it—no  consistency in morals or in money. lie was the most singular of men—dining on a herring  coach in London—wearing a hat soiled and rent wilh years,  and clothes threadbare, greased and darned with no profes  sional needle, nnd at the same time carrying in the top of hi;  snuff-box, a diamond which was in itsell an independent fortune—preaching part of tho year to his English parishioner.-  and gambling out the rest in the French metropolis. His inveterate attachment to ibis vice reduced him to beggary,  while his excesses brought on diseases tho most painful and  revolting. Suicide closes this contradictory, melancholy history,  Wilh Ihe  mind thronged with  the reflections which will  crowd into it, after the retrospect of such a tragedy, can we  but ask, where is the consistency of human nature ?    Does  lhc conduct of man  always  admit of explanation, from the  taoivn laws of mind and  motive?    From habit, and proba-  blythat habit formed upon philosophical truth, we are accustomed to answer this question without hesitation, in the affirmative: although in every ago, instances occur, which throw  the whole machinery of accountable action, of motived action  inlo strange disorder.   Anel in our confusion, we are temp-  lea to resort to the hypothesis of ancient psychology, that man  IS inspired of two souls, and that his conduct must be referred  to that which happens to bo in the ascendant.    But modern  •iccumcn, and modern conclusions, founded on fact, have sent  into the realm  of shades, this shadow of an hypothesis, and  we are compelled to return, and re-examine the laws of mind,  investigate new motives and now modes of thought, and attempt a rational Harmonising of the conduct of our fellows,  Willi the axioms of philosophy.  Never was there a more confounding instance of tho war  of reason and of pnssion, and of the fearful triumph of the  ,a"er, than in the person of the Author of Lacon. In him  violence is done, to every principle from which we are accustomed to dale conduct. The spirit of piety wept while she  admired, and the fiend of darkness shrank while he rejoiced.

The religious hypocrite is not alone in his hypocrisy; the  garb of piety is not the only cloak assumed or rejected at th*  dictate of circumstances. The blinking heart often mantles  tho cheek with a blush; bitter thoughts are often wreathed  imid words of sweetness. So was it here. Cotton played  his most phantastical parts while his feelings were breaking  over his heart "like a sunless ocean surging over a dead  world." What were his thoughts then? Remorse and disgust for hinisi If, and contempt lor the' open-mouthed million  who gazed after him, some in wonder and awe, nnd some in  affected superciliousness.

Calton wished to live, and he wrote the Lacon, Would  lint I possess d the power to present before you clearly, his  strange, irilefin ible character; but in utter an I urgent feebleness, I shrink from the attempt, fearing tho imputation of presumption in venturing thus much.  With a mind "so keen as to splita hair, and so powerful as  lo rive a rock of ad.immt," hear him from those nether regions of degradation in which he seemed lo live, v. ith characteristic inconsistency preaching sermons on sobriety; giving  I 'sson? in political, religious, and social wisdom, which are  driven homo upon us in a style that seems the concentrated  en-rrjy of ages. From these regions, where he breathed the  gtioi-dimp of sensuality, [Mow his mind on its "long-arrow flights of thought," up into the sunlight of that spot,  whose mere reflection is our blessedness; while swathed  in darkness, he dazzles with brilliancy—but lightning ever  flashes brightest from the blackest cloud.  With a calmness of thought that was appalling, and a  judgment apparently above prejudice', he spoke of vices and  their cures as if he knew them. Coolly, dispassionate Iy, unshrinkingly, he withdrew the veil, and presented to view the  naked human heart.    See him with  " Byron, with untrembling brand,  Impetuous foot and fury band,  Lit at the flames of hell,  Gj cl iwn and search Ihe human heart  Till funds from every corner s'art,  Tiieir crimes and plagues to tell;  Then see him (ling his totch away,  An.1 sun his soul in heaven's pure ray.'1  And the last scene was his own: and while the drugged  cup was in his hand, and the fiend of Suicide was gloati.ig  over him, with' an eye of triumph,—even then he uttered a  maxim which, from another, would have sent that fiend shivering back lo Hell. Such he lived, such he died !  Is human nature always consistent with itself? And I. do  nol reiterate ihe question in bitterness, or in sarcasm, or in  despair. For however humiliating lo the proud self-sufficiency of man, it does not disparage his high claims to our  veneration. He carries in his breast a power which God  alone can control; in his soul a principle whose duration God  alone can measure. These aberrations from truth and vit  tue are beacon lights to us who follow, casting tlit-ir mel-  choly, though monitory gleams over the rocks and quiet.  sands of vice, over the desolation and darkness, over tl  wreck and the ruin of perverted Genius.

Il is written in a very sprightly style, evincing no ordinary ability in the author. Home ofthe incidcnls  are very inters'.iug, and calculated to enlarge our knowledge  of the inanin rs an 1 customs of a country where civilization  is in ils dotage, The whole would have give n me unmixed  pleasure but for an incidental allusion to the christian missions established in that country. I have long deplored, in  c.ammon with all the friends of missions, the slow progress  which Christianity is making on tint strong hold of idolatry;  and with the Doctor, I am ready to admit, thai the conduct  of the professors of Christianity has net been the least hindrance to the progress of tiiith ; nnd even among those who  have gene ns mi-sionaiiis of the cress, there have doubtless  been some who havo not adorned the ge spe 1 of Christ by  temperance, humility, and deodncss to the woibl. The case  specified by Doctor Merwin, is a melancholy instance. Il  is the first that I havo heard, though there have no elouhl  been more. Human nature would have lo be greatly changed from what it was in the days of our Lord nnd the Apostles, if out of so many missionaries there should be found no  Judas to betray his muster, or Demus, who would lovo this  present world.  After these painful and humiliating concessions, I must  still think that Dr. Merwin has fallen into a very common  error, that of inferring generals from particulars, or slill  worse, judging of men from the representations of their enemies. I admit, for I have neither the right or inclination to  dispute the testimony, that Dr. Merwin did see in his Boston  friend a gross departure from christian simplicity. Does it  follow that hundreds of other missionaries do the same thing-  f think not. Anel suppose he did hear 'seme humorous stories' of tho 'happy' (I would rather say unhappy)'versatility with which some ofthe rigid promulgators ofthe  christian faith have relaxed in their observance of the stern  precepts of religion,' is it certain that there was in ibesc stories as much truth as humor? I think not. Were christians nnd christian ministers in our own country judged o  by the same rule, we should form a very unjust estimator1  their character.    I must say that if the Doctor was as unfor  tunate in his other acquaintances as in his missionary  friend. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/568	568	569.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/569.jp2

Merwin certainly cannot intend to say that Christianity Ins male no progress in India. This would contradict  the testimony of so many respectable eye wilnesses that ihe  Doctor could not intend it; and yet his language will readily  bear that construction. He says,' for hundreds of years have  they withstood the attacks of the sanguine advocates of the  tenets of Christianity, but so far from gaining proselytes,  these latter have too often only exhibited to the Hindoo the  Insincerity of their pretensions, and by their course of life  riveted upon the heathen a stronger belief in the infallibility  of his own notions of Divinity,' &c. The natural construction of the above, is, that Missionaries have not only not been  useful, but very injurious. If this be the case, the philanthropy of the ' pious ladies in Boston ' was greatly misplaced,  and the christian world has been laboring under nu egregious delusion, The sooner it is dispelled the belter. Bul  em this supposition « hat are we to do with the 'glory' ofthe  'episcopal labors,' of the late 'lamented bishop He-berl'  Was it a port of his 'glory' that he riveted tho chains of  heathenism more firmly? and what shall bo said of the la-  b-iis of S'.vails, of Gary, and of Jtldson? Did they contribute to the same end? and what shall we say of that book  of fables, published under the title of 'Buchanan's Christian  Researches in India?' It certainly will deserve a place  with Gulliver's Travels.  But before we make up our minds that Christianity has  made no progress in India, and that it has had no ameliorating influence on tho millions of that populous country, we  must come to the conclusion, that men who have in this conn-  ministers of the gospel in Mississippi among the heathen ab  origims of our own State, and yet he has been here much  longer than he remained in India, and there nre a liundrul  times as many people in India as in Mississippi,  Permit me to close these, remarks by an extract from a  note .in Bishop Mcllvaine's Evidences of Christianity, a  work which, by the way, [ would lecommrnd to all inquirers after truth—' It is will known to the author that travellers and voyagers not unfrequently biing back repoils of the  effects of missionary labors in tho regions they have visited,  which stagger the minds of many sincere friends of foreign  missions. The accounts of whit those honnnd and devoted  servants of Christ, called missionaries, are doing, and of the.  advances which the gospel is making under their influence,  may all be true; much more lhan they relate may be true;  and yet it is very conceivable, yea, natural, that such men as  our ordinary visiters of foreign lands should return ficm  ihose reg'ons, having neither seen nor heard any thing of  the matter. .Suppose a missionary were accomplishing, with  his schools and his preaching, among a tribe of Indians in  the ccnlre of the State of New York, about ns much as is  reported of the American laborers in the island of Ceylon;  how long might an intelligent traveller, with no interest in  religion, no relish for its intelligence, no love for tho societ"  of ils disciples, no knowledge of its journals—a man of fashion and gnyety, mingling only with the literary and woildly  minded; how long might he reside In the fashionable circles  of the city of New York, and sail up the Hudson, and stop  at Saratoga, and visit Niagara, and yet know absolutely  nothing of that diligent missionary and his usefulness ? Men  who have lived all their days in a city which abounds in re  try and elsewhere maintained the most irreproachable' moral ligtous institutions and christian labors, without having be-  character, have gone to India, and so soon as they have  breathed that contaminating atmosphere, have forgotten all  moral obligation, have united with each other to misrepresent the influence of missionaries, anel the state of Christianity m lint country, and this must be believed, not only of missionaries themselves, but of civil and military officers, merchants, and scientific travellers, and in this number must we  rank the ' lamented Heber.' So soon es my mind can be  brought to this .-tale of doubt with regard to human lislimo-  ny, I shall doubt whether there be such a place as .Madia I  or Calcutta: 1 shall think nil the world have conspired ti  deceive us.  Hut I repeat it, I cannot think Dr. Merwin intended to b,  understood to say that Christianity had made no progress in  India, though his words appear to me naturally to bear that  construction. But 1 nm inclined io think the Doctor has  been deceived in the amount of good done by the missiona-  r'(,s. His biisi|]css probably was not with the missionaries,  °f With those who would ho likely to know much of them  ~(1 must make an exception here to his Boston friend,  whose association was only of the 'convivial order.') Nabobs, Princes, Tiger-hunters, and others of similar character, would not be likely to know much of the self-denying  missionary, who pursued his heavenly calling among tin  Poor and ignorant. I think it very doubtful whether the  Loctor haS yCt learned the number of converts made by the  come sufficiently informed to give a stranger a correct account even of their respective characters, much less of their  real usefulness, will touch ai a port in lb'- Sandwich island.--,  see the port population, go no further than the coast, inquire  of none but ihe ungodly, and then come home and report  that the missionaries have done nothing to civilize or convert  tho people. How should such men know? On their principles of judging it might he reported, with equal rmson,  that Christianity has secured no influence end eh ne no good  in ihe city of New York. An anecdote will illustrate how  much such authorities deserve to be n gnrded A gentleman  not long since returned to his native city in England, after  having spent some three or four years in India. The pious  people of his acquaintance, not considering tho extent of the  Indies and his indifference to the cause of Christ, supposed  that of course he had see n ihe missionary stations, and knew  by his own observation nil about ihe reported progress of religion in thnt country. 'They inquired ..I' him ihe state of  things in this respect. He assurid them that the accounts  they had read of missionary doings and succisses in the east  had no foundation—were imps to get contributions. Ho  bad hern in India, nnd travelled extensively, and had seen  nothing of any inroads upon heathenism, nor any changes  among tho people; had scarcely heard ofthe existence of  missionary stations.

Before another century shall have passed, the intellect and the soul of wo-  in-iii, elevated, expanded and refined, by nobler studies, shall  entertain and breathe forth such sentiments of moral Illness  and beauty as shall not dishonor a being "madea little lower  the angels."  frm  PROPHETIC. Fulton, tho inventor of the steamboat,  seemed to be endued with the spirit of prophecy, in respect  to the navigation by steam of the Mississippi, the Missouri,  nnd oilier great rivers of the west; yet we know not that it  ever entered his imagination that, by his invention, Europe  and America would bo brought within ten days of each  other,  The following is Fulton's letter to tho Hon. Joel Barlow,  dated more than thirty years ago, a few days after his first  steamboat trip on tho Hudson :  "My in:\;t Fiiiund—My steamboat voyage to Albany  ind back, has turned out rather more favorable than I hud  calculated. The distance from New York to Albany is  ooo handled and fifty miles; I ran it up in thirty-two hours,  nod down in thirty hours. 'The latter is just five miles an  hour. I had a light breeze against mo tho whole waygoing  ad coming, so that no use was made of my sails; and the  roy.ige has been performed wholly by the power of the  Seam engine. I overlook many sloops and schooners beating to windward, and passed them as if they had been at anchor.  ■'The power of propelling boats by steam is now fully  proved, 'The morning 1 left New York, there were not  p rhaps thirty persons in the City, who believed that the  ton! would ever move one mile an hour, or be of the least  iiiilily. And while we were; putting off from the wharf,  which was crowded with spectators, I heard a number ol  Urcastic remarks; this is the way. you know, in which i  norant men compliment what they call philosophers and  projectors.  "Having employed much time, and money, and zeal, in  sccotnplishing this work, it gives mc, as it will you, great  pleasure lo see it so fully answer my expectations. It will  give a quick and cheap conveyance to merchandise on the  Mississippi, Missouri, and other grcat rivers, which are now  living open their treasures to the enterprise of our country-  "ten. And although the prospect of personal emolument  "M been some inducement to me, yet 1 feel infinitely more  pleasure in reflecting with you on tho immense advantage  wat ray country will derive from the invention."  SANDWICH ISLANDS.  RfinorlaMc Phenomena in lhc  Tides at the Sandurich, Islands.  On the evening and night of the 7th November, 1837, a  iwst remarkable commotion of the sea was witnessed at Honolulu, in many respects similar to that witnessed at these  islands in May, 1819. One inch and a half of rain had fallen during the previous twenty-four hours; the wind was  ''Mb from the north-cast, squally at intervals. The atmosphere was clear and cool—thermometer 74.5.    Tho barom  eter had gradually fallen during the four previous days, but  this evening hud again risen to 30.06, at G o'clock, when tho  alarm was given that the sea was retiring. The first recession was the greatest—something more than eight feet; but  being unprepared to make observations at the moment, the  exact fall was not measured. 'The reefs surrounding the  harbor were left dry, and the fish aground were mostly dead.  'The sea quickly returned, anel in twenty-eight minutes reached the height of an ordinary high-tide: scarcely remaining  stationary, it again receded and fell six feet. This was re°-  peated at intervals of twenty-eight minutes.  Sinco tho above was written, distressing accounts have  been received from IVIaui and Hawaii of the damage done to  property and loss of life. On the leeward side ol Maui the  same rise and lull took place as at Honolulu, but on lhc win-  ward part of the island the sea retired about twenty fathoms  and quickly returned in one gigantic wave, sweeping.every  thing before it, houses, trees, cimoes, and every moveable object exposed to ils fury. At a small village, called Kahulni,  in the district of Wailukii, on the sea retiring, the amazed  inhabitants followed il as it receded, eagerly catching the  stranded fish, shouting nnd hallooing with pleasure, when  suddenly lhc sea rose perpendicularly before them like a precipice, and rushing to the beach, buried the assembled multitudes in the flood, and overflowing the shore, swept uwny  every house; in the village hot ono; the canoes and property  ofthe natives wero all destroyed. Happily, owing to iho  amphibious education of tho people, but two lives were list  here, but us the same occurrence happened all along the seaside, we shall probably hear of more deaths.  At Byron's Bay, on Hawaii, ihe same phenomenon took  place. An unusual number of persons were collected lo-  gether attending a protracted meeting, consequenlly every  house was crowded. At half past six lhc sea retired at (lie  rale of four or five knots nn hour, reducing tho soundings  from five to three and a half fathoms at tho anchorage, and  leaving a great extent of the harbor dry. Hundreds of curious souls rushed down to witness tho novelty, when a gi-  gantic wave came roaring to the shore at the rate of six or  eight knots an hour, rising twenty feet above high water  mark, and fell on the beach) with a noise resembling a heavy  peal of thunder, burying the people in the flood; destroying  houses, canoes, nnd fish-ponds, washing away the food and  clothing of tho inhabitants, large quantities of animals, firo  wood, and timber collected on the strand for sale. 'The cries  of distress were horrible; those in the water unable to swim  among tho wreck of houses, and pieces of timber, struggling  for their lives, and those onshore wailing for their friends  and relatives. The British whale ship Admiral Cocbburn  was at anchor in the Bay, and to ihe timely aid and humane  exertions of her master (Lawrence) and crew, many arc indebted for their lives; but for the assistance rendered by their  boats, many who wero stunned and insensible, would havo  been carried out to sea, and perished, as the natives had not  a single canoo left that would float. Every thing was destroyed; thoso who escaped with their lives had neither food  nor raiment left. In Kanokapa and Knahelu alone, sixty-  x houses wero destroyed, and eleven persons lost their lives,  :*;;:' 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/571	571	572.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/572.jp2

We had thought that the wo,Id had  nothing to learn of the intelh dual greatness of this eminent  mathematician, but this discourse heightens our respect for  his talents, by showing us with what little aid, and in the face  of what difli.'ultios his large attainments were made.     Ol  the moral excellence of his character, a variety of delightful taste for knowledge, may, in its pursuit, shun the thousand  zens of Columbus, in view of the beneficial effects it will  certainly exert upon our moral, social nnci intellectual culture. It is not expected of the members of the members of  the society to become teachers of the public; but, 1 y on interchange of sentiment on the subjects of Science, Literature,  Education, and Morality, they may learn of each oilier, imbibe n taste for study and reflection, and diffuse their concentrated knowledge lo all;—and, more then nil that,—to cultivate social feeling and to acquire a lasle for the more refined  anel virtuous enjoyments of life.

Few are the theories that obtain in this country merely for the sake of theory. The internal world of Syinmes,  demonstrated so plausibly by the enthusiastic monomaniac  with his hollow globes and refracted sunshine that seemed to  bo as well pleased to give light to the dwellers inside the  shell as to thoso who had taken an outside berth on our mother planet, never awakened a single dream of its reality in  the mind of the educated, well trained part of our community, The colleges indexed were respectful listeners lo all the  enthusiast could say about his untravelled world, whose map  stretched along the inner crusts ofthe foot ball which ancient  time set in motion when Adam was the solitary passenger—  at least, on the outsidel But the colleges wero not convinced I No navigator had ploughed a furrow on the rim that  bent over from the supernal to the infernal siele of the shell;  nil the phenomena of navigation could be reconciled to the  outside figure of a spheroidal globe, whose surface might be  dust, and vapor, and wind-stirred particles of water, but whose  centre must be the condensed focus of matter, where gravitation presses water into stone, and the ponderous rock into li-  quiil (lame. In the centre of the earth sober geology could  only tinel the great central furnace which heats the globe—  whose seething fires find here and there their volcanic vents,  and breathe their hissings into the heavens. Thus the theory of John Cleve Symm.es sunk into the hole which it created, but whicli the great eye of the Creator never saw.  There—il may bo in the wombliko receptacle of "all things  lost upon earth,"—some other madman may find it again  after many clays, and again vex tho patient world wilh the  eternal humbug.  Theories are the chaff which the wind drives from the  threshing floors of intellect. No reasonable man mistakes  them for wheat. Cui bono! what is the good? has been  the outcry of pure philosophy in every ago of tho world.  As the insect called the cicada, or Italy did, which fills your  southern groves with contradictory music—one. voice asserting that kaly did, and the other that katy did'nl, until ten  thousand disputants lake up tho vexed question and wreak its  merits upon every car that is not split by the clangor; so in  the world of mind? have the curc/cajoften thousand theorists  been answered by the twice ten thousand cui bonus of the  cold-blooded utilitarians!  Il is well it is so. Let every thing be judged by ils use.  Wore it otherwise the whole world would bo afloat, like  jsomo unstable island broken from its moorings in the midst  of a boiling ocean. The energies of mind would bo expended in overtaking shadows—only to grasp thin air—while  all the teachings of antiquity wool I be forgotten in the cease-  less whirl of uncertain experiment.  It may bo assumed that every thing powerful or useful depends on immutable principles. The far-reaching arrow  was never shot from a nerveless and weak-handed bow. The  sun that lifts so broad a smile over earth, ocean and sky,  must of necessity be an orb of light of a magnitude that beer-  gars tho lesser orbs that Moat like moles in his mighiy eye:  so any thing that produces so strong an effect on human character as education does, must, of necessity, have fixed and  Immutable principles. What were the principles on wb' i  education was based thousands of years ago, and what w  then ils influences upon human character must be those s  principles and influences now. The operations ofthe moial  and intellectual world have certainly as much method - I  rule as those of the natural world. The one, indeed, has hoi  been as well studied as the other. Had it been so we should  have long since known how to get up a moral as well as  a physical sleam engine; wc could as well have had a domestic moral earthquake or thunder storm to clear the atmosphere of error ns a mimic eaithquake to shake an acre  of ground, or a puny cloud of vapor curling up in a ,:n(,ra.  ist's laboratory, through which he shoots his bolts ofthe electric fluid and makes it melt into rain. But the great Grecian maxim, " know thyself," has been too little heeded by  man.  Analysis will show us that education was always moral  power. The learner ofthe teachings of God was ever u  more powerful intellect than the devotee of folly. The education of Enoch, taught him to escape death, which rested  on all else who lived before the flood, while the education ol  Noah (leiatcel him over the broadest and stormiest ocean ihat  ever belted the green earth and overwhelmed its millions, in  an untimely grave. The education of Joseph led him to the  throne of Egypt from the cell of a prison. The cdncalini  of Moses made him the conqueror of that Egypt whose stern  law had doomed him to death in infancy, and his suffering  parents to bondage. Instructed in all the wisdom of Egypt,  to which-he added the better education of fearing God, bis  moral power was as capable of over-reaching nuel absorbing  the collected learning of the savans of the Nile, as his serpent rod was of swallowing the rods of the magicians, who  vainly essayed to test and measure his immortal science by  their puny juggleries and divination, The education of Du-  vid enabled him to charm the demon that rioted in the bosom  of the first king of Israel; it was education that made him  Saul's successor, although thereby the stupid doctrines of legitimacy received their earliest blow, but which fell on heeds  loo thick to feel and too obtuse to learn. The education of  Solomon (and he had deeply studied nature as well as man)  made his words the peerless lessons of wisdom, and enabled  him to write the epitaph of earth—" Vanity of vanities, all  is vanity. "  ll enabled him to rear a teinplu whose beauty astonished  the world; to amass wealth and power, at the sight of which,  other rulers fainted and had no strength remaining in them.  It was education that gave Jesus power at twelve years of  age, lo dispute with the venerable law doctors in the temple,  and gave him wisdom which no man could gainsay in a-iei  ife.  It was this, having been educated after the strictest forms  of a learned sect, that made Paul the very chief of Apostles,  It was Ibis that made Socrates too powerful a being for  sufferance in tyrannical Alliens, and Alfred of England, the  Washington of that "fast anchored isle."  It was this that made Voltaire the demon of the French  revolution, stirring the elements of sin with the wand of an  omnipotent genius, and showing the horror-struck age, ho" 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/574	574	575.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/575.jp2

It was education ihat made Franklin stronger than th  thunder, and Fulton the king ofthe waves.  Education has brought Europe within a week's distance  of young America—has chained the Alleghanies to the  While Hills of New Hampshire, bound the Mississippi with  a silver thread to the Hudson, lashed the St, Lawrence to  •he hoary mane ofthe Atlantic, anel made Lake Superior the  transcendent Adriatic of the New World.  What deity gave such a sceptre to man, as he went wee'p-  ing- through the angel-guarded gates of Eden, into a world  nl tears and death 1 To this question the Delphic oracle is  dumb and Mythology hath no answer : but ihe great age of  improvement speaks from the observatory of mind, and answers me—Education is both moral and physical power!  With modern educationists, I divide instruction and human  culture into its three departments: physical, intellectual and  moral education. Of the first I shall not be expected to  speak at large. To another profession than mine belongs  the consideration of ihe ways and means to give breadth to  the chest, lithcness to the limbs, and elasticity to the foot. It  will not be expeeled that I should go inlo the comparative  merits of Graham's bread and saw-dust, as articles of diet, or  whether the man-machine is capable of more intense thought  when starved down to the thinness that the moon will shine  through, or when as fat as "two single gentlemen rolled into  one."  Nor can I, like the giants of phrenology, toll how to improve tho human race by "crossing the breeds." These  "crossings" are for the magi of another section of our conn  try—the wise men of the east.  But may I not speak of the rise and development of the  intellect—that glorious faculty which has inscribed immortality on the destinies of man 1  "Of all that lire and move and breathe,  Man only rises o'er his birth;  He looks around, above, benealh,  At once tbe licir of heaven and earth.  What guides him in his high pursuit,  Lightens, illumines, cheers bis way,  Discerns the Immortal from tbe brute,  God's image from Ihe mould of clay ?  'Tis knowledge!  Knowledge to the soul  Is life and liberty and peace;  And while eternal ages roll  The joys of knowledge shall increase."  Commencing at a point scarcely perceptible on the map of  human existence, the intellect grows lo a godlike size; yet it  is never monstrous. The larger it grows tho more perfect  -ire its proportions. Passions may be of a monstrous growth,  hut intellect never I The philosophers of mind, divided  •bough they may bo on the topics of an innate moral sense,  or of innate ideas in the mind ofthe new-born infant, are yet  'mited on the doctrine of the adaptation of such a mind for the  gradual reception of now ideas which may be derived from  sensible objects in the world around, from parental example,  a"d moral lessons,  intellect, they may be destined to astonish and bless mankind  in the progress of their development; they may kindle slowly, yet burn brightly nnd long.  The object of intellectual cultivation is, no doubt, ns said  by one author—" to enlarge the understanding, polish the  taste, strengthen the reasoning facilities, and to give Habits of  patient attention, deliberate, independent judgment; and to  unite with these the attainment of useful practical knowledge,  as well as to furnish mental exercises."  To gain these objects, attention and study are requisite, as  well as thought. The intellect must act of itself upon tho  subjects brought before it; its perceptions must be brightened  by intense menial labor, and the habil must be acquired of  self-reliance, not only on its own powers, but on ils own taste.  The energies of intellectual life require ready-furnished  minds, having a cool command of every instrument or avenue of approach to other minds. The man of intellectual  power sufficient lo form his own opinion correctly, and then  to control the opinions of ninety-nine others, is a hundred  strong; he represents a body; he is no longer a single individual ; ho has the suffrages and the power of a multitude!  The simple resolution lo know not only the meaning of,  hut the reason lor, every accessible subject that comes under  ihe consideration of any intellect, will carry one much farther towards the goal of perfection and the full development  of mental [lower than many seem to be aware. This resolution will carry one far into the nature and analogies of  things. A word, for instance, is spoken or written on some  peculiar occasion or subject. The intellect is charmed with  its fitness, and follows it back, in its history, to some other  language, perhaps, from whence it is derived. Here, in its  origin, the word in its formation, alludes to some peculiar  rite, or custom, or time-hallowed locality, which link it lo associations of rich interest and unwasting grandeur! Thus  the full development of the. intellect includes a study of the  origin and philosophy of language j and the richer in-philosophy and associations, either sentimental or historical, any  language may be, the greater the benefit which the intellect  derives from its study. These are reasons strong enough to  sustain the linguist, ns he reads, wilh patient labor, the languages of those departed nations who were cither illustrious  in arms, the arts, in science, literature or philosophy.  From the mathematics the intellect gains its love of truth  and demonstration, and is armed with a new power over matter, running lines and anghs where none save the foot of an  angel hath trod, or his spirit-wing'waved on some errand of  his ministry.  Aided thus, the intellect measures the mighty cycle of nature. Every thing vast, anel distant, dipped in space, and  hung by canopied clouds, is measured by the mathematician's  rule, spanning the void across which scarce, a twinkling  beam bath found its way from the dawn of creation up lolho  hour when La Place, and Herschcll, and Olmstead, and Es-  pey talked with ihe stars, tho meteors, and the storms.  In the midst of my subject, I am somewhat confused by  the intimate connection which subsists between the intellcc-  ti.  *'.V  V.i  M  !  ,if  &lt; 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/575	575	576.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/576.jp2

Hut the power of intellectual education, may, perhaps, be  contemplated in its general effects on human character.

This comparatively brief space of intellectual culture bus  made ono man to become a hundred in capacity of fooling,  in knowledge and intellectual enjoyment. Every object that  now meets his eyes, once incapable of suggesting splendid  strains of association, i- now linked to something noble anel  spirit-stirring in the past, iho present, or the future.  Swimming across a frith or estuary, in the days of his unlettered boyhood, would not have been considered a matter of  high achievement, nor would his soul have wanned'into.  some poetic frenzy, as ho dragged his chilled limbs, like a  wc dog, up tho opposite bank: but now, doubtless, he would,  under similar circumstances, think at least of Jonah anel the  whnle, if not of the swimming race, the two water-snakes  that coiled round Laocoon and his two boys, had from Ti ne-  dos to the plain before Troy, and to the passage of Leander  across the Hellespont, borne up by a lover's hope anel a lover's ardor.  they too lived and panted for immortality.  The action of his intellect is now like that of a powerful  anel well-fiitiil mass of machinery—with judgment ns a bub  lance wheel, and radiant fancy ns the fly wheels, all set in  harmonious motion by the propulsion of burning thought.  Pope's stanza may will be adapted (o the action of a cultivated intellect: "Lives through all life and operates unspent." The engine thus set in motion, and thus endowed  with super-human power, must roll on in ceaseless action  through the term of human life—and onward still until tin,  soul, that cannot grow old, shall wax mighty in the immortality of its energies, and tho perfection of ils developments.  Like a ship of wonder, borne over the "sea of gla:-s," ihat  wells out from tho foot of that throne where sils llie TIncre.  ated Thought, so shall this revolving intellect sail in the rye  of heaven, approaching nearer and nearer to ihe Unapproachable, and burning brighter and brighter with the fires of tbe  Unconsumable, until lhc eestacy of earth shall be forgotten.   amidst tho intellectual profusions of heaven—-or remembered  inly to, and never tried upon only as the starling point of being—the twilight of eternity  isieal dimly resting on the bosom of the thick darkness thai preceded the birth of the soul.  Nol only every hour of life, but even tho dreary hour ol  death, has a strange and high excitement to the cultivated in-  tcllect, The poet's thought, "thou shalt lie down with patriarchs and kings," comes rolling upon his intellect, which  calmly contemplates tho ruin of tho body, and philosophizes  r not, ho is now possessed on each new and strange sensation which invades the ciladel  y of intellect. His features of his being,' as the outwork*, ono by one, are taken by the  last enemy. What hurried thoughts then range through all  time, striving from the past to forestall the future, and anticipate doom !    .  It is said of one who fell from a height with the full expectation of being dashed into eternity on his reaching the  earth, but who was providentially saved, that, during bis  foil—the brief second of time in which he passed from the  summit of a steeple to tho ground—he found time to review  every principal event of his life, lo sigh out his farewells to  ouch dear friend of his heart, to calculate his prospects for  either heaven or hell, anel to throw himself with an inexpressible energy upon the merits of the Great Sacrifice. From  the long and dreamless sleep of insensibility, ho awoke—  not in either of the two worlds whose dreadful shadows  stretched, like dragon wings, over this eclipse of bis being—  but in this world, nnd lived to tell the Inst thoughts of earth,  as his soul was on wing for the shores of immortality.

[s Intellectual Education Important? Is it power, like  thai of the visioned Deity, seen by the river Chebar, wheel  within wheel, self-moved and full of the eyes of a fearful intelligence? 'I ako cure, tin n, of your vocation, ye teachers  of youth and creators of the intellect!  Amidst the records of mind, I select one of tho most prominent instances of intellectual power and capacity. The  name ol Bacon is a star of the first magnitude in the horizon  ol intellect. It shines as fur as letters are known, or wherever philosophy has triumphed over snvagisinand ignorance.  Ah, his was an intellect, which, take it all in all, we may  never see its like again, while the English language continues lo he tin; medium of literature to three-fourths of the  world,  A keen critic into the elements of Bacon's intellectuality,  has finely siiel of him, "That his understanding'resembled  the tent which the fairy Paribonou gave to Prince Ahmed,  Fold it; and it seemed a toy for a Lady's hand,—spread it,  and the armies of powerful Sultans might repose beneath its  shade."  To give to the human mind a direction which it shall re  lain for ages is ihe rare prerogative of a few imperial spirits.  This was Bacon's prerogative.  The true philosophical temperament may be described in  four words :—much hope, little faith—a disposition to believe  that any thing, however extraordinary, may be done ; an indisposition to believe that any thing extraordinary has been  done    In those points the constitution'of Bacon's mind seems  fame was greener than iho laurel. His power was that of a  monarch. Yet amidst all this ink llectual wealth and splendor—with a reach of intellect, rarely surpassed, and which  distanced all that antiquity had done before him—and shaped  the judgment, the reason, and the philosophy of all coming  time, there was an awful defect in his Education, which sent  him, notwithstanding his great powers, a heart-broken, drivelling and despised old man to Iris grave.  There was that in him which more lhan justified Pope's  antithesis:  " The brightest, wisest, meanest of mankind."  I  n:.  to have been absolutely perfect.  A writer has elegantly applied to him the elevated stand in  intellectuality which Milton gave to the scope of his Archan-  gel who first surveyed the now creation :—  Round lie surveyed, and well might, where he stood  So high above the circling canopy  Of night's extended shade,—from eastern point  Of Libra, to the fleecy star which bears  Andromeda far oil' Atlantic seas  Beyond the horizon."  He wrote of himself: " I have taken all knowledge to be  my province,"  Every thing that study could accomplish was his.    His  My purpose only is, by such a dreadful example, to introduce tho last and chief division of my subject,—the Moral  Power of Education.  This was what Bacon lacked. This was the desideratum  which made him vulnerable, and allied his splendid and far-  reaching intellect to the lowest associations of moral degradation.  By the Moral Power ol Education, I mean its influence  on the heart and upon the formation of principle. The memory may be freighted with the lore of all time.thefancy laden ■  wilh every thing glittering in tho rainbow of genius, tho  judgment may be perfected, and every intellectual power developed to a giant proportion, and yet the man is not half  made—the object of his Education is not half accomplished  —and in the midst of all intellectual wealth, the man of  Mind may be a moral beggar.  This is a point in my subject which demands a irrster ^  hand, to throw its own imperishable colors on the canvass of  time—colors which, when the strongest seen there, are but  tho eclipse of that bolder moral  picturing which  Eternity  bears upon ils unwasting tableaux.  Well may the Teacher of Mind regard his vocation with  awe, and say of himself as Young said of his species:  " Man is the maker of eternal fates."  On this ground the Educationist wields the power of Oei-  ty—a creator of immortal excellence anel a happiness as limitless as the years of God.  The first dawnings of tho morning of Education should  bo moral suasion—a gentle traclation of the better feelings  of the infant heart into such courses as will infuse a blessedness through its moral sensibilities. Teach the smallest  child to be kind to another, and give of its choicest toys to  increase the pleasure of another child, anel it will feel a glow  in its bosom richer than all the joys of a narrow selfishness;  teach that child to forgive an injury, and while he puts his  little arms round the offender's neck, to kiss away his wrong,  he feels godlike! oh, he would be forever forgiving offences !  Teach him the claims of duty—how every selfish foeling  hould give way to the requisitions of duty—how rest, and  ease, and play, and pleasure should intermit—until its littlo  icart could feel the better pleasure of its duty done—and he  has learned the great secret'of being happy through all  time.  Teach him the preciousness of words of truth, and he will  ever, of choice, speak those words.

You plant a sheet anchor in his  soul, through the power of which he shall be able lo ride out  the future storms of passion, and achieve the final moral conquest over the original obliquity of his nature.  There is not a ricfi, glad,.innocent, or brave feeling of the  heart, but may bo appreciated and enjoyed almost by the  youngest child.  A little boy near Hagarstown, in Maryland, was one day  pointing out to me a copse ol trees as the place where Washington, at the head of the Virginia rangers, fought a bailie  long before the war of the revolution with some Indians headed by French from Fort Duquesne, now Pittsburgh. The  little fellow had seen some balls of lead that had been fired  in that battle, chopped from ihe centres ofthe now massive and  aged oaks. I saw that the sunbeam of some sublime moral  emotion was in his eyes, and I asked him further of Wash.  ing:on, the brave youth who led the Virginians into that  thicket when the war whoop shook its boughs, and the rifle  rung in its gloom.  His mind seemed to glance like lightning through the illustrious deeds of arms in which Washington had been engaged, and settled down at the closing scene of Yorktown.  He told me of one circumstance only. Said he, "when the  British troops were marched out of their entrenchments to  lay down their arms, Washington told the American army,  1 My boys, let there be no insults over a conquered foe ! when  they lay down their arms, don't huzza; posterity will huzza  for you.'"  I could have hugged the little hoy 10 my bosom. Although  he had not probably been able to rend more than four years,  yet his mind hud drunk in the moral greatness of the act of  sparing the feelings of a fallen foe. I asked him what it was  that Washington said, that posterity would do? he quickly  answered, hurra. Hurra! then, said I; and he sent his  clear, wild shout inlo the battle wood, and 1 shouted with him  Hurra for Washington!  An important part of my subject is the Union that may  and should exist between intellectual anel moral education.  Like that holiest of earthly lies, what God hath so joined  together, let not man put asunder. If in the ninety-seven  colleges in the United States and in the almost countless-High  Schools and Academies which adorn, nnd fill iho count  wore educated lo the noblest principles and emotions of our  nature, as well as their heads stored with the treasures of the  ntellect. The ono course of education dooming its subject  o a fiery, erratic path, often eclipsed in tho gloom of infa-  my; the other so balancing the powers of the combined  nan, as to secure him from the probabilities of uncertain  ate—making him invulnerable to disgrace—always superior  to fortune—as far above her sinilo as her frown—like some  tall mountain summit that hath grown up in altitude so neat  the stars that the thunder cloud forms far below its peak,  where the calm sunbeams sleep, while all is tempest and  gloom beneath. The union of the two powers forms Ihe  perfect education,  An Education of terrific and destructive energy may be  obtained by cultivating the Intellect alone. Such were the  educations of Alexander, of Hannibal, and of Caesar, the Napoleon of Rome. An Education of great excellence (nay  be gained by an effort of the moral power only; a man may  be very pious, and yet have much ignorance; but the perfection of the power of Education is found in the trinity of its  developments—physical, intellectual, moral!  Intellectual Education, in its antithesis to Moral Education, is as the miner to the smeller of the ores; the one seeks  the quarry, rends ils strata, and finds the coarse gray metal  that has slumbered for thousands of years in the embraces of  the stone; the other causes the pure gold to flow out in a  ductile mass of richness and splendor, disconnected from ils  dross, and fit for the crown of an empire;—the one is the  pioneer that explores and runs the boundaries of a country,  fixing upon the sites of its cities, and stretching ils map across  rivers and mountains; the other is the husbandman, who caliches the soil with the waving harvests of plenty; the one  is the advance guard, commencing and bringing on the skirmish—then perhaps retreating; the other is the heavy column of battle that shall not waver under its heaviest thunders, or break into confusion before ils most fearful avalanches; the one is the white-capped surge, running broken and  confusedly before the chariots of tho storm; the oilier is tbe  mountain wave, which pulsates from tho groaning bottom ol  tho sea, rolling onward and stronger until it becomes a wall  of power, that the dyke of God's invention, the sand beach,  alone can withstand.  The one is tho (lash, the smoke, and the voice of the can  non; the other its noiseless messenger, that bears more lhan  wo could feel assured that Moral and Intellectual Education  was plurning both its wings at the same moment in every  bosom and in every brain, well might we rejoice and say of  our beloved land, ihat its glory should be as perpetual as the  everlasting hills.  There are in American Annuls, sad instances of tho education and power of the intellect, to the neglect of that of  the heart. Of these beacons of warning, the case of the  traitor Arnold Was one; the histories of Pierpont Edwards  and Aaron Burr furnish others, while, on the other hand,  the shades of Washington, and Franklin, and Marshall, and  Wirt, with a countless multitude that come rushing on the  memory, furnish tho cheering contrast—men whose hearts  r.v', tho wrath of the thunderbolt on its wing; the one is the chill  winter, with its lustred snow-wreaths, its icicles pendent in  Odin's halls in his northern palaces, its flashing keen-eyed  stars—but with its desolation and its chill; the other is tho  verdant spring, with the breath of flowers and the song ol  birds, bearing on its green bosom tho hope of the year and  the promise of plenty.

THE ABORIGINES OK AMERICA.  Various have been the theories and conjectures as regards  the primitive colonists of the New World, from want of historical documents, or some species of positive proof The  historian and antiquarian have therefore to depend on the nature and amount of accumulated probabilities resulting from  analogy: it is consequently evident that the greater the probabilities, the. more nearly do they approximate to certainty  and indued conviction. However true it may be that analogy, even when it presents no apparent imperfection, can seldom be received as conclusivo argument with a calculating  student, and never with a deliberate skeptic ; and that though  it may form a part—even an important part—of speculative  reasoning,' it cannot be permitted lo do more by philosophers  of exact minds however candid or disposed—man possessing  but finite reasoning powers and having no determined certainly of any tiling which has not been palpably perceived  by his own senses, is necessarily obliged to depend for most  of Ins knowledge on the conclusions of analogy, which  leaches him how lo infer things unknown from those known.  And as all his knowledge, not derived from immediate sensation, results from this analogy or relation of things, he is ob-  'iged to rely on it in a majority of the  circumstances and  opinions of life; rather than discard all hopes of increased  Intelligence, pleasure and power. Hence it is that the process and practice of inductive reasoning have been so much  cherished by modern philosophers; and that acts have enlarged as science has improved.  Accumulated diets when generalized seem to establish, a  principle; and accumulated probabilities when analysed may  establish a theory. Of course, caution and scrutiny must be  used in both instances, before truth in tho former and certainty in the latter can be attained. Facts may indeed establish truths; but it is difficult to derive certainty from probabilities alone; yet when some ascertained facts are united  with many probabilities of correct analogy, a candid mind  may rest satisfied with the conclusion deduced. Such is the  modus operandi proposed in attempting to ascertain who  were the aboriginal settlers of this continent.  Nations are distinguished by organic structure or peculiar  developments, by language, by customs, and by religious  rites, etc, etc., and though there maybe many differences between people of one land and those of another, from climate,  tune and other causes, whenever and wherever we perceive  peculiar similarity of a radical nature, we may conclude  there was an original sameness or identity. Differences  cannot destroy the distinction nor the likeness.  Modern philosophers usually divide man into six races—  the Caucasian, Hyperborean, Mongolian, American, Malayan, and Negro or Ethiopian ; and describe them by certain  distinctive features or appearances. The negro may be (lis-  tinguished in every part of the world; and so mny tho red  man of America. But though we can with certainty trace  the negro to Africa, wc cannot with a like certainty trace the  red man to nny part of the old world.  The theory which would trace the American to theJew-  ish race, cannot bo admitted by an exact mind: for tho Jews  are still extant, with the same peculiar fealur.es as of old,  nd are of the Caucasian race of man. Positive facts are  therefore in the outset against such a theory: for no intelligent mind can admit that the red and beardless American  was ever identified with the Jews, whose peculiar cast of  features can never be mistaken, anel has existed from time  immemorial. Nor can he be identified with any nation or  people extant.  Slill records may furnish a clue to the required identification: for an identification is necessary, unless one should  gratuitously supposo that a peculiar race of men hud been  created for the purpose of peopling America: and this could  bo the conjecture of infidels and general credulists or skeptics alone.  But first it may be necessary to state that any identification, "or any arguments bused on probabilities, must be deduced from the records anel condition • of the Mexicans, when  their country had been invaded by Spain: for their history,  tradition, monuments, language and religion have been more  accurately ascertained, than those of any other people or  tribe in America, when discovered by Europeans. It is then  well to state that Mexico at that period was under the control  of, and chiefly peopled by, a different nation from lhal which  had there previously existed and flourished—that an invad-  .&gt;5i,'.'  1  .

'■  ing people had conquered Mexico, as Rome had been vanquished by the Goths, and China by the Tartars. The existing people were called the Azteques, the vanquished were  the Tnltequcs: as in other instances, (he former preserved  many of the monuments and customs, and acquired some ol  the knowledge of the latter. This they acknowledged ; and  is recorded. The Mexicans asserted that they had come  from tho hyperborean regions of America; and had taken  the country they possessed from a different tribe. They further stated that their country had originally been peopled by  " wandering builders or masons." This is proved not only  by their tradition nnd assertion, but by their hieroglyphical  or picture writings, which record their feats or transactions.  But both the Azteques and Tulteques wero red and beardless  men, ns represented on nil their hieroglyphics.  Now history records the country and vicissitudes of an  extinct race of red men; not only whoso appearance, but  whoso customs, language nnd religion are identified with  those that existed or had existed, in Mexico particularly, and  America generally, when discovered during the 15th century. The primitive race was variously designated. Sometimes tho people were termed 'shepherds' or 'shepherd  kings,'as in the Pentateuch; ' wanderers,' 'wandering masons,' 'giants,' ' Cyclopcans,' 'Pelasgians' or 'Peleginns,'  i. e. of the race of Peleg mentioned in Genesis, und afterwards Phoenicians, etc., according to the country which they  inhabited. They were the great Cyclopean family, commonly called 'Titans,' in mythology, from their various architectural foals in building temples or towers und pyramids,  whose summits reached the clouds or heavens.    This hnbi-  of Tyro, and of Carthage, forms u prominent part of ihe  transactions of those reel men.  It is recorded that they were the first lo invent signs or let-  lers for sounds, if not the first to invent symbols for transactions and idens: they invented the phonetic language or hieroglyphics, and they improved at least the symbolical. To  Cadmus, one of their race, Greece acknowledges to havo  owed ils language of letters or writings; and his arrival in  that country is generally held synonymous with the flight of  Israel from Egypt, or 1491 before Christ. The characters  he brought were essentially Phenician or Pelasgian; and  had been previously introduced into Egypt. They were  known to Moses; nnd it may bo supposed he used them in  writing the second edition of his decalogue, And it is not  unreasonable to infer that they hail been used previously in  writing the book of Job. At least history sanctions lhc  idea that they had been used by the various nations of Canaan—who were of the Cyclopean, Anakim or Pelegian  race, and had been expelled by Joshua. The temples, lab-  lets nnd inscriptions of those Ciinaanites tally accurately  wilh those of the Phenieians and with those formerly and  still extant in Mexico. The ruins of Taehnor in the wilderness, are akin to those of Paleiiijiio in Mexico.  To those Phenieians or Ciinaanites may fairly be attributed the primitive or original colonization of. America, both  eastwaidly and westwardly. That the Phenieians visited all  pails, and discovered many portions of the old world, is a  fact well authenticated, and that they had ships capable of  navigating the ocean, as well as inland seas, is equally irdtl-  bilable.    Their passage from Spain and Africa to the British  tude of masonry, or free-masonry, to congregate and fortify Isles, is fully attested, end thai they had discovered an ultimo  themselves wherever they dispersed, was their prominent  .characteristic, while pastoral Iribes or nations; although Subsequently, when they engaged in commerce nlso, as in Tyre  and Carthage, Egypt and Greece, lliey became as celebrated  for other arts as for architecture, They invented the various  phonetic und symbolic, characters; and have left vestiges of  their monuments and acts, wherever they visited or settled.  And those vestiges are alike in the new world as in the old,  They may be traced from Babel to Syria, Egypt, Greece,  Carthage, anil various parts of northern Africa, to Spain, and  iho British Isles, on one side of the early colonization of the  earth—and to Persia, Ophir, India, China, and Japan, on the  eastern side from where ihe Noachidie resided. Existing  monuments, tablets, nnd inscriptions interspersed in various  countries, of precisely the same tenor and characters, attest their peregrinations as plainly as history itself could;  and are as strong sources of testimony, when united with  tradition, as any human record could be.  History records the expulsion of a race of red men from  Egypt, by one of its most celebrated kings, prior to the exit  of the Israelites; (and not at all identified with them,) and  that to those red men or shepheid kings, did Egypt chiefly  owe her northern pyramids, hor hieroglyphics and her religion. Doubtless ihi'se were subsequently imitated and amplified by their conquerors; but sufficient vestiges of the  originals still remain, to justify an identity wilh like movements, wherever they exist.    The history ofthe Phenieians,  ihule, distinct from the obi world, is more than a subject ol  mere tradition': for it is positively recorded in the history of  Carthage, thai the discovery and possession of such a country formed a slate secret with the Carthaginian government  and that both Tyre'and Cartilage had acquired much of llieir  peculiar wealth from that country. Those who are versed  in ancient history will understand and admit this j and those  thoroughly conversant, may admit also the singular account  of the Phenieians traversing oven llic Cape of Good Hope.  To others the proofs would be too tedious, and probably useless.  The etymology of spoken languages is seldom a safe  guide to the derivation of nations.: lor vowels are nothing,  and consonants next to nothing, even in the etymon of languages themselves. But symbolical or written language  may approximate safely in nn identification, Hence it is  that the original colonists of Spain nnd Ireland have been  traced to Rhcnicia; and by a very similar proce-ss, the primitive seniors of America may be also triced to the same people or country, Not only that Phenician inscriptions, etc  have been -discovered in Massachusetts and other northern  parts; and that the Mohawk or Iroquois language, with that  of various Indian tribes, is u counterpart of ihe Phenician—  ml Phenician monuments or memorials of various kinds, so  abound even slill in Mexico (as they did also partially in  Peru,) as to leave litlle doubt in the mind of any candid person of an original identity between the Phenieians or Oa-  naanites and the aboriginal Americans. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/580	580	581.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/581.jp2

The antiquarian discoveries made in Mexico during the  present century arc of equal interest nnd importance to the  literary world, ns are those made in Egypt, and of course  should be of greater to the present inhabitants of America.  And it is somewhat singular that thoso discoveries in both  countries, lead to precisely the same results—almost demonstrably proving that the same people originally built the ancient monuments of Egypt and Mexico. The style of building is alike; the portraiture of men is similar; the emblematical devices of primitive worship are very generally the  same; and the signs of language all but agree, both phoneti-  eal and symbolical. Thai there arc some differences, merely shows tho progress of events in ihe lapse of ages. And  as Egypt is known to be indebted to the Phenieians for her  oldest architectural and lingual monuments, it may therefore  be fairly inferred that so also is Mexico : und consequently  it may be concluded that ihe Phenieians were the original  colonists of America.  Tt has been fully proved by various modern wi iters, thai  the Cyclopean race, of which were, the Phenieians and some  tribes of Canaan, carried with them in their wanderings, all  the favorite forms of the Pastoral or Cyclopean architecture:  "tho pyramids, gateways, triangular or graduated archways  without the keystone, cellular cairnes, unsculptured initiatory caverns, irregular courses of colossal masonry, cylindric  columns, and rock-built fortresses; which (wherever they are  found) attest their presence." These are found in various  parts of Europe, Asia and Africa, where history records  their settlement; and found in various parts of Mexico and  Central America, where tradition avows their colonization.  At the Bureau des Antiquites Mexieaines of Paris, various works have recently been published, describing and depicting several ancient monuments, ccc. lately discovered in  different parts of what was formerly called New Spain j nol  only a republished account of the three expeditions undertaken by captain A.  Dupaix in  1805, '6 and 7, by order of  the Spanish government, which is illustrated by Castaneda:  but tho works of Humboldt, Del Ris, Ncbcl, Gondra and  others.    Pyramids exist in   various places, similar to the  graduated ones of Egypt, although of larger base.    Vessels  of noble architecture and sculpture arc visible at Cholula  Olumba, Oaxac.a, Miltan and Tlascola.    The mountain  of  Teseosa is  almost covered with ruins of ancient buildings  'if a Phenician character.    The ancient town of Palenqiu  exhibits excellent  workmanship in temples, palaces, mansions and baths; and in the sanctuaries of that town, are  found sculptured   representations of idols, resembling the  ancient gods of Syria and Egypt.    In the same ruins, planispheres and zodiacs exist, which indicate extraordinary attainments in astronomy and chronology.    And most of those  monuments or  memorials appear to  be coeval   with, and  similar to, the Egyptian, Etrurian, Syrian and Indian antiquities of the oldest date.  These probabilities if not proofs arc so strong anel numerous, that wo may safely conclude as Mexican tradition  (recorded by Cabrena) asserts the aborigines of America  came from tho maritime coasts and colonies of Phcnicia—being probably composed chiefly of tho people who were ex-  SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  217  pelled from Egypt by Scsostris, those from Canaan by Joshua, and those from Carthage by the Romans. Thai others  may have emigrated from the eastern parts of Asia by the  northern straits of the Pacific ocean, at a subsequent period,  is not improbable; yet it is simply conjectural.  XT , H. Percy Leonard.  New Orleans, Jan.  1838.  Antiquities of Eovpt.—The Hon. Mr. Buckingham,  late member of the British Parliament and moro illustrious  as an oriental traveller, has communicated to the United States  Magazine a series of the most valuable papers in relation to  the antiquities of Egypt, under the head of "Recollections of  Eastern Travel." From his last number we extract his description of the massive ruins in the vicinity of the Cataract  of the Nile, and of the famous island of Syene or Assouan,  which has given the name of Siennito to a certain description of granite.  "On crossing over to the island of Elephantina, or, as it is  called by the natives, Gczirat Assouan, wo  landed at the  southern extremity, and  climbed  over the  steep reeks by  which it is here defended from the stream.    At this end are  remnants of a solid quay-work building, founded on immense  granite  rocks, sculptured  with hieroglyphics, though  the  building itself is plain, and may be either of Egyptian, Greek  or Roman workmanship, having been constructed wilh the  materials of ancient edifices, tho broken and uiicemented ornaments of which, are visible in many detached spots     This  embanked facing is continued towards the eastern edge ofthe  island, opposite the Arabic ruins of Assouan, founded also on  rocks, and might have been intended to preserve the soil from  being forcibly torn away  by the  stream, which  becomes  rapid here from its depth and contracted channel.    Two portions of square windows, looking from a gallery toward the  Nile, are the only remains of the building which was about  tliis massy wall, and the traces of steps communicating with  the water may also be seen, though now choked with rubbish,  us well as iho door by which  they opened into lhc stream.  Foundations of well built  private dwellings, scattered fragments of sacred edifices, and heaps of rubbish, formed by the  accumulated destruction of Arabic settlements, cover all the  soil, and present a picture of ihe saddest desolation.    Among  the known Egyptian monuments, the  first on the south, is  the portion of a large gate, of red granite, ornamented with  sculpture of a coarse style and execution, and beyond it, towards the cast, foundations recently dug up of an extensive  building which continues all the way to the water, and appears to have communicated with the flight of stairs leading  from the freestone quay and gallery into the river.  North of this, and nearly in the centre of the island, is a  temple of small dimensions, but in excellent preservation. It  consists of a sanctuary, entered by a portico of two columns,  and enclosed on each side by a gallery of stpiarc pillars, the  entrance facing towards the east. Every part of the building is ornamented wilh' considerable care, the subjects are  varied, the sculpture excellent, and the coloring beautifully  orcserved in several parts. On the facings of the pilasters,  which form the surrounding gallery, are represented two  VOL.

On some of tho groups, both the figures wear the human face; in others, the male wears the head of the goat,  and in others, of the hawk. On the outer walls ofthe temple, the same subjects are frequently repeated, particularly on  the south, where the parties are guarded by the hovering  vulture, accompanied by long inscriptions in small hiero-  glyphical characters. The design of the northern part of  ibis temple is more distinct, from being less encumbered with  rubbish, and the sculpture is less injured and defaced.  The subject of these pictorial representations appears to  relate to the progressive rewards of a successful hero, from  his first receiving the benedictions of the priesthood, to his  being admitted to the honor of presenting an offering in person to the divinity, arranged in successive pictures. The  first toward the east, or ne'ar the portico, contains a group of  four persons, tho principal of which, may be either a priest  or a deity; he wears a feathered head-dress, and from his  wrist hangs a chain, ingeniously formed of hieroglyphieal  emblems, while he supports himself on a staff of tho same  admission into their order, and the last, his incorporation  among them by the investiture of the sacerdolal headdress  and by his offering of bulls lo Priapus, whoso mysterious  presidency over nil religious rites, whose triumphant elevations in all processions, whose eternal representations in eveiv  temple, from the threshold to the sanctuary, and even upon  the altars themselves, I have endeavored in vain to understand. The dress of the hero through every step, except the  change of head ornaments in the last, is rather that of a war-  ior than that of a priest; the features are evidently those of  an individual portrait throughout, anel bear, in many instances, the closest resemblance in all the representations of the  face. Inscriptive tablets are always hung near him, and the  protecting vulture is his constant guard; a combination of  circumstances which incur a supposition of its designating  tho honors done to some successful warrior, who might have  founded this small temple ns a monument of gratitude to the  divinity who presided over his arms, and to whom it might  havo boon subsequently dedicated as a lasting record of bis  victories.  The inner walls of tho sanctuary represent a grand sacrifice, beautifully sculptured, the stone preserving the fineness  and color of marble. Near the terminating door, the hero  is represented between the priest and priestess, who both embrace him; and towards the entrance of tho sanctuary he is  seen, attended by the female only, officiating before a rich al  nature. To this personage, the hero is in the act of being tar, and presenting an offering of incense in one hand, while  presented, by a human figure, wilh a goat's head, wearing he pours out a libation with the other, Around the altar are  the sacerdotal habit, and followed by a female with tho lotus-1beasts and birds of sacrifice, fishes, fruits, and flowers, the lo-  staff and key, or crux ansata. The slender figure is closely tjis and palm in all their varieties, vases of liquors, and em-  wrapped in a rich embroidered robe, painted in splendid CO- blemntic representations of iho divinity, lsis.    Upon the altar  lors, and a serpent is seen issuing from the front of the head  dress. The priest reclines one hand on tho shoulder of him  whom he presents, and lays the other on his head, as if in  benediction ; while the god extends his arm, and placing his  hand on the brow ofthe hero, bestows his approbation or his  blessing.  itself is represented a large boat, containing a votive temple  surrounded by the winged globe, tho emblem of eternity; the  extremities of this boat arc terminated by ram's heads, executed in a bold style, and richly ornamented; and before the  votive temple worshippers are kneeling. Over every pari  of this picture are long inscriptions, in perpendicular co  in the next compartment, the same individuals present tojlmnns, of small hieroglyphics, while tho hero himself is still  him, in whoso presence he last stood, the offering of lotus accompanied by his inscriptive tablets, and still guarded by  flowers; and the third picture represents him with a different  head-dress, sacrificing to the priest and attendant female who  presided over his first introduction, the victims for the feast,  bound animals, birds, fruits, flowers, &c. The last of these  divisions portray him with the horns and sacred bonnet, worn  by the priest in the sacrifice, and presenting to the divine  Priapus an offoring of four young bulls, which ho leads before him in a group, by strings fastened to their fore legs,  holding them coiled in his hand, while a key hangs at the  end of each, grasping, at the same lime, a wavy staff anel  holding in his right hand a rod, by which the offered animals are driven.  On tho first inspection of this progressive history, I was  inclined to interpri t it as the progress of a candidate for initiation into tho sacred body, with whom every attribute of  power appears to have been lodged; and to consider tho first  as alluding to his presentation for approval; the second, his  offering to him who had bestowed the benediction and accep-  tho protecting bird.    Could this have been the offering of a  spoil taken in battle? tho consecration of the vessel which  had borne him successfully through a voyage of danger? or  of ono in which he was about to embark for war?  On following the line ofthe portico, toward the Nile, fragments are met with which prove tho attachment of other  buildings, now destroyed—and at a short distance are the remains of a Greek or Roman circular porch, to the north ol  which is a red granite statue, in a sitting- posture, of coarse  execution, and much disfigured, in ihe proportion of about  nine feet high, and with the arms crossed on the breast, holding in one hand a crook, in the other, a flail, like the figures  at the Memnoniuin at Thebes, but without hieroglyphieal ornaments, ns if it had never been finished,  Nothing remains of this temple, further to the north, except one side of the pilastered gallery, and a small part ol  the sanctuary wall. This edifice appears to have been built  on the same plan and dimensions as the southern one, since  lance; the third, his sacrifice to the priesthood as the price of'the square pillars are precisely of the same size and number, 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/582	582	583.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/583.jp2

The destruction of  lhc walls is a matter of extreme regret, as, like those of th  other temples, they certainly depict the progressive stage's ofl  suae historical event, tho triumph of some hero, and, in many places, the figures nre grouped with a graceful case that  departs from the usual severity of the Egyptian pencil  In one group a hero has vanquished an enemy, who lies  extended prostrate before him on the ground, while three oth  cr persons are, apparently, expressing their gratituele for de  livery; and the victor, in an attitude of earnest declamation,  is in the act of returning their address with the warmth and  animation of a Demosthenes. An aeljoining compartment  represents offerings of inrense to the same hero, who here  bears a standard, or some warlike emblem; and other groups  much broken and defaced, show graceful combinations and  expressive forms.  In the large compartment above, the honored chief is receiving a presentation from the divinity itself, under the form  of Isis: and in the centre of this picture priests are bearing  on their shoulders a large altar, surmounted with a boat, in  the same manner as on the inner walls of tho sanctuary, in  the temple wo last saw, to the southward of this.  Reaching this, the northern extremity of tho island of El-  ephantina, we embarked in a small boat, and made the circuit of il by water. The scenery, from every point of view,  is highly picturesque—bold granite rocks, clusters of small  islands in the. stream, intervening spols of verdure, scattered  palm grounds, water raised by wheels and oxen, fertile gardens, and interesting ruins.  Landing on the western bank of the Nile, opposite to Assouan, we ascended the long and tedious hill of sand, which  extends over to the edge ofthe river, and after a weary walk,  in a scorching sun, we reached the ruined Christian monastery on its summit. Although one finds no remains of art  within its mud-built walls to repay, in gratification, the difficulty of the way, yet it is impossible to continue long amid  such silent desolation without having all the feelings of th  heart brought into action, without becoming oppressed with  a reflective melancholy, as sad as the sterility of the scene  ihat inspires it. We walked round the building, ascended  the tops of its ruined walls, and traversed it in every dircc  lion without being able to form any thing like a correct idea  el" its plan. It appeared to be a mass of confused chapels,  balls, long galleries, dark and confined cells, and even ramparts of fortification, built at different periods, subsequently  fallen into decay, in the order of their successive erection^  afterward repaired, and converted to different uses, and now  firming an extensive, but nn irregular and dilapidated pile.  Every portion of the building was rudely constructed, and  the interior decorations wero not less so; the chapels, of|  whif h there must have been a considerable number, each  having, apparently, its tutelar saint, were whitewashed, and  painted on tho inside with full length portraits of hermits,  whose features and drapery, from the instability of the colors, were now indistinctly mingled, and not one even of the  enumerable Greek sentences on the walls, could be accu  rately copied without much labor and a long stay, having  been written with a loose red chalk, ihat was at first, mosf  probably, imperfect, and is now scarcely legible.  Egyptian Monuments.—Had not the monuments of  ancient Egypt been multitudinous in their number, and imperishable from their greatness, none of them would have  been left undestroyed by the various inundations of fanatics  and foreigners who have, from time to time, overflowed the  lands of the Nile. The Persians and the Saracens, under  the influence of religious passion, did all they could for the  overthrow and ruin of works happily too majestic for their  puny devices; nnd since invading armies have left the gorgeous ruins in peace, hordes of European travellers have  been doing their best to annihilate what thirty and forty centuries have spared. There is scarcely a pillar, or temple, or  monument, which some hand or other has not been busy in  damaging. The beautiful tomb of Osiris, which Belzoni  laid open, is already nearly a heap of ruins. No man has  been a more ruthless rnvager than Champollion himself,  with all his pretended respect for Egyptian antiquities, and  professed services to hieroglyphic learning. For one traveler who has visited Egypt to unravel and to honor the venerable records of her solemn history, a hundred come lo defile and deface them.  A German Prince, whose proceedings are seldom spoken  of in Egypt without some addendum of reproach, thought it  a very fine thing to leave his distinguished name in large  black and filthy characters on the most prominent part of tho  large sarcophagus in the sepulchre of Remesis the Fifth.  The dilapidations of some of the most striking remains of  Egyptian antiquities have long been witnessed with sorrow  and shame by every thoughtful traveller, and many a wish  has been vainly uttered that measures should be taken for  their preservation.—Even within a few years, some of the  most interesting nnd ancient buildings—as the temple cf A-  bydos and Hermopolosis—have been wholly overthrown, and  even the sites they occupied are scarcely traceable. Tin-  attention of the Pacha has, however, lately been particularly  called to the subject, and he requested Dr. Bowring to draw  up a plan for the preservation of the monuments that remain, for the prosecuting future discoveries, and for the formation of a museum of Egyptian antiquities in Cairo. In  consequence of Dr. Bowling's recommendation, a permanent commission has been formed al Caiio, by the. direction  of Mahomet Ali, consisting of the principal Ministers of  State, of the Consul Generals of England, France, Austria,  and Russia, the President and Secretary of the Egyptian Society, and othcT appropriate persons, to whom is to be committed the guardianship of the monuments of Egypt. A sum  is to be placed annually at their disposal, to enable them to protect the various temples, tombs, and works of art, to pursue  new investigations; to employ fit persons in order to report  on the state of existing antiquities, and lo provide for their  safe and proper keeping. No ancient monument will be removed in future without their sanction, which is also necessary to allow any person to commence or to continue excavations.    They will facilitate the researches of the curious and  m  .--'I-"'  *!  1  •'.  ml  4  ■i-  Ml  i 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/583	583	584.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/584.jp2

From (.ockhart'fl l.if) of Scoit.  THE GREAT UNKNOWN REVEALED.  Friday, twenty-third of February, 1828, was a memorable  day in the life of Sir Walter Scott and in the annals of literature; from that day the secret of the authorship of the novels, which had partially disclosed itself on Constable's failure, became fully revealed lo the world. Sir Walter hat  been requested by Mr. W. Murray, the manager of the Ed  inbiirgh theatre, to preside on that day at the first festival ol  a charitable fund for theatrical artists in distress. He was  supported by Lord Fife, Lord Meadowbank, and many other  distinguished friends. One noble person having been prevented from attending, to whom the health of Sir Walter  had been assigned as a toast, Lord Meadowbank was suddenly asked to undertake the duty, and, remembering that this  was the first public dinner at which Sir Walter had appeared since his losses, took him aside to inquire whether ho  would consider it indelicate that allusion should bo made to  the parentage ofthe novels. Sir Walter, smiling, answered,  " Do just as you like, only don't say much about so old a  story." The speeches made on this occasion arc given from  the notes of a friend who was present, "with greater accuracy," says Mr. Lockhart, " than in the reports of the contemporary newspapers." We have not room for the whole, but  we give the most interesting passages. Lord Meadowbank,  after anticipating the enthusiasm with which the health oil  Sir Walter Scott was sure to bo received, and adverting to  the mystery in which any speaker must have veiled himself  who should, some time before', in proposing that health, have  advened in Sir Walter's presence to the then unacknowledged works, proceeded to observe that obscurity of allusion was  now no longer allowable. " The clouds," he said, " have  been dispelled, the darkness visible has been cleared away,  and tho Grcat Unknown, the minstrel of our native land, tho  mighty magician who has rolled back the current of time  and conjured up before ouv living senses the men and the  manners of days which havo long passed away, stands revealed to the eyes and the hearts of his affectionate and admiring countrymen." • ••««• .. yye ou.c t0 |,jm) as  a people, a large and heavy debt of gratitude. Ho it is who  has opened to foreigners the grand and characteristic beauties  of our country. It is to him we owe that our gallant ancestors and illustrious patriots, who fought and bled in order to  obtain and secure that independence and that liberty we now  enjoy, have obtained a fame no longer confined lo tho boundaries of a remote and comparatively obscure country it is  he who has called down upon their struggles for o-lory and  freedom the admiration of foreign lands. He it is who has  conferred a new reputation on our national character, and bestowed on Scotland an imperishable name, were il only by  her having given birth to himself. I propose tho health ol  Sir Walter Scott"  Long before Lord Meadowbank ceased speaking, the company had got upon chairs and tables, and the storm of an-  plauso that ensued was deafening. When they recovered  from the first fever of their raptures, Sir Walter spoke as  follows:  "I certainly did not think, in coming here to-day, that I  should have the task of acknowledging, before three hundred  gentlemen, a secret which, considering that it was communicated to more than twenty people, has been remarkably well  kept. I am now at the bat of my country, and may bo understood lo be on trial before Lord Meadowbank as an offender; and so quietly did all who were 'airt' and 'pain' conduct themselves, that I am sure that were the panel now lo  stand on his defence, every impartial jury would bring in a  verdict of ' Not proven.' I am willing, however, to plead  'guilty;" nor shall I detain the court by a long explanation  why my confession has been so long deferred. Perhaps caprice might have a considerable share in the matter. I have  now to say, however, that the merits of these works, if they  had any, and their faults, are all entirely imputable to myself, Like another Scottish criminal of more consequence,  one Macbeth,  " ' I am afraid to think- what I have done;  ' Look on't again I dare not,'  I have thus far unbosomed myself, anel I know that my confession will be reported to the public. I mean then seriously  to state, that when I say 1 am the author, I mean ihe total  and undivided author. With tho exception of quotations,  there is not a single word that was not derived from myself  or suggested in iho course of my reading, The wand is  now broken, nnd the book buried. You will allow me fur-  thor to say wilh Prospero, 'It is your breath ihat has filled  my sails;' anel to crave ono single toast in the capacity of tho  author of those novels. I beg leave to propose the health ol  my friend Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and I am sure that when the  author of Wavcrlcy anel Rob Hoy drinks to Nicol Jarvie, it  will be received with the just applause to which that gentleman has always been accustomed—nny, that you will take  euro that on the present occasion it shall be pro-di-gi-OUSl"  ( Long and vehement applause.)  " Mr. Mackay.—My conscience! My worthy father, the  deacon, could never have believed that his son would have  sic a compliment paid to him by the Great Unknown !  The sensation produced by this scene, was, in newspaper  phrase, unprecedented at the theatre. A few nights after  wards the farce of High Life below Stairs was performed,  in which one ofthe servants asking, "Who wrote Shakspeare J " is answered by another, "Ben Jonson." Mi'- "  Murray, who played in the piece, diverted the audience by  rejoining, " No, it is Sir Walter Scott—ho confessed it at a  public meeting the oilier day."  Dr. Ciiannino.—The last number of Eraser's Magazine,  a work which is regarded as high critical authority in England, contains a highly complimentary notice of the writings of Dr. Channing. The writer commences with thin  bold and candid assertion:—"Channing is, unquestionably,  the finest writer of the age.

His meaning  dies not require to be gathered, by dint of persevering investigation,, from ihe heart of a cumbrous phraseology: it strikes  lit once', Nor is this ils transparency tho result of weakness  or want of compass; tho very contrary is the case. From  his writings there may be extracted some of the richest poetry and original conceptions, clothed in language, unfortunately for our literature, too little studied in the day in which  we live. Channing appears to havo imbued his mind with  the spirit ofthe masters of our island tongue; their very  tones seem lo have filled his car, and to havo become keynotes to his finest compositions; their strong idiomatic English has evidently worked itself into the mind of our author,  and taught him that, in tho phraseology which weak minds  pronounced to be jejune, there was a versatility capable of  becoming, in the hands of a master mind, expressive of great  and ennobling thought." The critic again say that "there  ii a force anel finish in the pages of Channing, ihat indicate  at onee great genius and protracted elaboration';" and adds,  "his writings have charmed us into the attitude of fervent  purity readily respond to their call in leading the public exercises of the. meetings, and leaving the impress of their cultivated powers upon the mass of mind by which they are surrounded. We can scarcely conceive a more interesting  spectacle than that of an entire community engaged, at staled  times, in tho acquisition and communication of knowledge—  a twice blessed imployment, since, like charity, it blesscth  both the one who gives and the one who receives instruction,  It will doubtless be a matter of importance for future consideration to array all these voluntary associations into one  great union, to co-operate with and strengthen each other,  under a general name, and under a system of judicious division of intellectual labor.  MAP OF MISSISSIPPI.  We have before us one of the proof maps of the State of  Mississippi, including parts of tho States of Louisiana, Alabama and Arkansas, compiled chiefly from public surveys,  by Colonel Samuel Gwin, Cashier of the Mississippi  Union Bank, and George Doiihartv, Esq., Surveyor and  Civil Engineer.    This is one of the noblest and most perfeel  SOUTH-WESTKR.V  JOURNAL  NATCHEZ, JUNE :il),   1838.  Voluntary Literary anb Scientific: Associations.  The friends of intellectual improvement cannot but rejoice at  the formation of associations in tho State of Mississippi, within a few months past, that must exert a powerful influence  upon individual character as well as upon the literary repu-  lation of the State. The records which we present in the  present number of the South-Western Journal, of the formation of iho Lyceum in Wilkinson county, of its sanction of  ihe South-Western Journal, and the specimen of talent dis  played in the opening lecture, are topics of the most gratify  ing character to those who cherish a deep interest in the  cause of mental improvement.  Tho account of the formation of an efficient society for  the dilfusion of knowledge in Lowndes county, comprising  an unusual number of educated gentlemen, is equally flattering, A number of lectures have been already delivered before this society. We solicit their cordial co-operation in the  great common objects of their society anel ours, and pledge,  ni return, that interchange of sentiments and good will which  should ever characterize those engaged in a cause so noble  and elevating.  The Lyceums at Clinton and Grand Gulf are, we learn,  in active operation—the latter having recently been addressed by Rev. Professor S. V. Marshall, of Oakland College.  The second lecture in the Wilkinson County Lyceum was  delivered by the Itev.  William Winans.  The importance of these voluntary associations for improvement is much enhanced by tho fact that gentlemen of  die highest reputation for intellectual acquirement and moral  admirers." This is high praise, coming from so disinterested State maps extant in the United States. The compilation is  i quarter—but we do not disagree with the Frascrian critic a work of the greatest accuracy and labor, to which the beau-  in his estimate of the merits of Channing's masterly style, tiful engraving of John Knight, of Philadelphia is no dis-  -.V.

It is projected on a scale of a square inch lo a  township, showing the courses of rivers, lakes, bayous,  creeks, tho slate and county boundaries, the sites of county  sents and towns, the location ofthe most important plantations  in each county, mill seats, mineral springs, old Indian traces,  post roads, rail-ways, turnpikes, prairies, post oliices and election precincts.  Tho very face of this elegantly executed map is eloquently expressive of the immense natural wealth and resources  of the great cotton state. It gives the old river channels, the  cut-offs, and the numerous islands that checker the bosom of  the Mississippi river. It is, indeed, in the faithfulness of ils  details, the fulness of its information, and in its size, the best  map that has ever been made of any state in the Union.  It cannot he possible that the state of Mississippi will not,  by a most liberal patronage, reward the toil of years which  has been cheerfully given by both the gentlemen eoncorneel  in this undertaking, to tho perfection of this splendid anil  unique specimen of correct topography and elegant engraving.  As the copy before us is the first proof sheet of the map  which has been received in the slate, wc are unable lo state  at what time the numerous subscribers to the map will be sup-  plieel with their copies, or when they will be offered for sale.  We sincerely hope that but little time will elapse before ihe  people of Mississippi at large, shall have an opportunity, at  glance, to see tho outline, the boundaries, and the capabilities of the immense state they occupy. This map should  hang in every planter's hall in the state. It is invaluable to  the land purchaser, as well as the traveller and the merchant  Wo anticipate a patronage for this work which shall cheer  the compilers and remunerate them lor the toil and expense  they have freely spent in the completion of their magnificent  design.

SOUTH-WE S T E It N JOUR N A L,  223  Mr. Drake, a resolution was adopted, expressing the thanks by singular good  fortune, the weather e,  ,1 the Society to the late corps of officers, for the able and  faithful discharge ol their duties. The members appointed  for regular exercises being absent, Mr. Forbes read an interesting voluntary on tho Indian Mounds in the vicinity of  Vatehcz. The Secretary read a letter from the Hon. Peter  0 Thachcr, of Boston, accepting his election as honorary  member of tho Lyceum.  The resolutions to amend the constitution were then taken  up, and, after much discussion, several important alterations  were effected.  Drs. Cartwright, Blocksom, and Crocheron were elected  regular members of tho Lyceum.  The following appointments were then made for the first  Wednesday in July:  Rev. 13. M. Drake, Lecturer.  Drs. Monette and Cartwright, Essayists.  On motion, the Society adjourned, to meet June (3th in Natchez, at Mr. Dubuisson's office, at the hour of 4 P. M.  S. C. MERWIN, Secretary.  EXPEDITION TO THE NORTH CAPE.  1'rofessor Parrot, well known for his travels to the Caspi  an Sea nnd Caucasus, and  more  recently for his ascent of  Mount Ararat, made a journey, in the course of last summer,  to North Cape, at the expense of tho University of Dorpat,  for the purpose of making astronomical and niagnetical observations, and of noting the oscillations of the pendulum at  the most northern point of the European continent.    Ho left  llorpat on the tenth of July, and, travelling through Russian  Finland by Wyborg, Kuopioand Uleaborg, reached Tornea  on the twenty-third.    In that remote little town, at the head  of the Gulf of Bothnia, ho was surprised to find a comforta  hie inn, and markets well supplied  with the produce of the  south.    He proceeded on his route by an interesting navigation of three hundred and eighty miles up the rivers Tornea  and MuontO, sometimes between hills  well-peopled and eul-  livated, but more frequently through thick woods.    The rivers, in some places, opened into lakes; in others, they fell in  bold cascades.    At'length, he reached the sources ofthe Mil-  onio, about one thousand four hundred feet above the sea, am  close to tho borders of the three kingdoms, Sweden, Norway  and Russia.    Leaving his boat on  tho shores of tho  lake  and placing his instruments and baggage on the shoulders of  'iglit sturdy   Philanders,  M.  Parrot  crossed, on   foot,  the  Scandinavian ridge, through the most diversified scenery imaginable; patches of snow lying in  tho clefts of tho rocks,  while at their feet was a most luxuriant herbage, with berries of many kinds, and the full bloom of a short, but vigorous summer.    The little   lakes and  cascades wero without  number.    He had not advanced far through this wild scenery, before  he descried the  waters of Lyngenford, an inlet  which runs a long way into tho land.    On it he embarked  ia a small boat, manned by Finlanders, to make a voyage of  nearly two hundred miles to North Cape, which ho doubled  on the twenty-fiftli of August, in the face of contrary winds;  bis little boat looking like a nutshell, ns he expresses il, beneath thai bold promontory.    On his arrival at North Cape,  dearrd up, and his  scientific observations were continued for twelve days, and  completed under the most favorable circumstances. He had  no sooner commenced his preparations to return, than winter  set in with a violent gale, which confined him for ten days to  one of the small inlets on the coast. Ho subsequently made  his wny over land, partly on foot, partly in sledges, over the  snow anel ice of the rivers, lo Tornea, whence he returned  to Dorpat in December, with, it may be presumed, a rich  harvest of philosophical materials.  I'rom Blltlman'l Jonrnicl-  Caoutchouc.—Much attention has been bestowed upon  this article, with n view ol discovering some solvent or mode  of reducing it to a consistence capable of receiving any desirable form, or of being applied lo the surface of cloth in  the form of varnish, in order to render it water proof; but  believing that no method has yet been made public by which  it could be used with economy and facility, I am induced to  offer the following, with the hope that it will be found both  useful anel interesting.  I wish to premise, that all hitherto known solvents of ea-  tchouc arc liable to objections. In a trial which I once  made, I found that oil of turpentine dissolved rate caoutchouc readily; and on having been spread on calico and exposed lo tho atmosphere, it remained glutinous at the end of a  year.  About two years ago, I was induced to perform some experiments with caoutchouc, and I accidentally ascertained,  that if it he previously cut lino and immersed in common  sulphate of ether or a solution of (some alkali 1 I used) carbonate of soda, two ounces lo a pint of water, for a week, and  then put into good new oil of turpentine, it dissolved with Iii  cility; and when spread on cloth and exposed to a dry atmosphere, it speedily dries and assumes its original properties,  usually in twenty-four hours.  Calico, linen, or articles of clothing, may receive a coating with ihis solution, sufficient to render them waterproof  without materially altering their general appearance or injuring their pliability.  When less elastieity and more body is required, I hazard  a conjecture, that this solution may economically bo diluted  or mixed with asphaltum, Venice turpentine, or some other  articles soluble in oil of turpentine.

The monthly  meeting for July will be held in the Methodist Church in the  city of Natchez, on the evening of tho Fourth of July-—the  ecturor being Rev. B. M. Drake, and tho essayists Doctors  Cartwright and Monette.  There could bo no time more suitable for the meeting of  the Lyceum than tho eve of our National birth-day.  Heat of the Weather.

It may not be uninteresting, now to deduce the  mean temperature and such other facts as the imperfect character of Ihe tables presents. During a great portion of tin-  year, a barometer coiilel not be procured ; so that no annual  results have been obtained therefrom. Much pains have  been taken, however, to have the temperature registered, exactly that of the atmosphere, The thermometer used has  been a standard for twenty years, and is notoriously correct.

These latter exhibit a remarkable sameness in their temperature at all seasons of the year, and in all hinds of weather. The mean  temperature of the atmosphere is sufficiently near to corroborate the suggestion, first made I believe by Humboldt, 'thai  tho mean atmospheric temperature of any region, is equal to  the constant temperature of its springs.'  All the solstitial and equinoctial observations of the above  year, have militated against the impression that they produce  a change in the weather.  Observation has been carefully and constantly made in  reference to the truth of Mr. Espy's theory of storms; and  it is but a just tribute to the genius of that philosopher, to  say, that nature has convinced us, that his is the true—no'  tenciS'or m.™!™6,it ; T2r^'r'o^"?T 'I ''"'f: '',"'"" 'i'' °V°™F?I,&lt;1 "'"&gt;' theory—but' philosophy of storms.'

Pukicidi-.st:  I am aware that tho subject of education in several of its  important brunches, lias been brought ably before this Asso  i-intiun. But such is its importance anel complex character,  that I trust I shall be excused for intruding a feu- thought;  moro on the same subject.  The term education does not convey to the mind all that  is intended to be brought to view in these remarks. Man is  so complex a being in his nature, capabilities, interests, and  relations, that it is difficult to find a single term that will express all the training and culture necessary lo his high destiny. He is a compound of matter and mind—of reason,  passions, and appetites,—is capable of sensual, social, and intellectual enjoyment, and of moral improvement without  bounds. He is allied lo his friends who form the social circle around him; to his country, as an integral part of the  body politic ; and to the human race, as sharing a common  nature; and to God, as his creator, preserver, and governor.  To assist man to turn all his high capabilities to the best possible account, is the object of education  This subject naturally divides itself into physical, intellectual and moral culture. The first of which shall occupy  the greater part of this lecture, not because of its superior  claims, but because it is treated of so rarely.  By physical training is understood whatever will perfect  the body, so as to enable it to procure subsistence, and comforts for itself and dependents; and to bo the most perfect instrument for tho operations of mind  It will be seen, at tho first blush, that in this, as in all the  other departments of training children and youth, the parent,  ,-inil not tho school teacher, must be the principal guide. It  is in the nursery that a good foundation must be laid, or in  many instances it can never be successfully laid. By proper  food, in well regulated quantities—by a wise adaptation of  clothing and exercise, the young scion shoots forth with vigor and promise. But for lack of thoso timely attentions, the  constitution is often ruined in tho earliest stages of ils formation. In many instances tho injury is irreparable by the skill  of the physician, or tho efforts of the patient. Parents who  have the solo management of children at an early age,  should lay this to heart, and not permit any foolish fondness  to cause them to lay tho foundation of incurable effeminacy,  We assume it as universally admitted, that exorcise is essential to tho perfect development of the strength, and to the  general health of tho constitution. To secure this, nature  has endowed the young with love of motion, which unrestrained, or properly directed, will in most instances eflect  '■he object.    But it is in directing this propensity to action,  that proper habits of industry arc formed, and by impressing  Bend bcfjro llio Jefferson Collngo nncl Washington I.yot , July 4,1838.   I!v elln mi-mi „.:,u ,t,n „„i,.„ „r ,i    e   -.     ri ,       i   , ■       „  lno m,1KI Wltn tno value ol the fruits of labor, habits of economy are produced.  This process may bo commenced at a very early period.  Almost as soon as lhc infant limbs are capable of motion,  that which is prompted by the instinct of nature may bo directed in a proper channel, governed, restrained, or urged,  as occasion may require, so that at a very early age, salutary  habits may bo formed. The difficulty does not generally  lie in producing a disposition for action, but in regulating it  so that it may not be the desultory offspring of whim.  Want of-proper attention to physical training, both in (am  ilies and schools, occurs to mo to bo one of the mo t crying  evils of this age and country. The injuries which it is inflicting upon individuals and communities, are great and ir-  sparable. There must be a radical change in this respect,  or our country will bo cursed with incurable and insupportable effeminacy; or pass, through successive generations, into lhc hands of more hardy fortune-hunters of the north,  It woulel seem that no one, with any pretensions to observation, could fail to see that this is iho effect of our present  system of education.    If patriotism calls on us to rise e;i  masse to defend our homes and firesides when invaded by a  foreign foe, her voice is no k'ss unequivocal in the present 4  case.    Every lover of his country or race should rush to  tho rescue, before the insidious flattering foe undermines all  the energies of our species.    What renders this foe ihe more  dangerous, is, ho has for his dictator one of the greatest tyrants which ever destroyed our race.    This imperious dictator has in almost every ago murdered millions of the species in cold blood, and without remorse—yet in appearance-  this monster is placid, smiling, polite and courteous.    Men  of all ranks, and of every profession and age, pay court to  him.    Dandies and belles think it would bo better to bo out  of the world than from under his dominions.    Do you in-  mire his name?   It is Fashion. Such influence has ibis malignant, Proteus shaele, that with nine-tenths of mankind his  ipse (licit is above all reason and common sense.    Reason  with men as clearly as you may, get them to admit that your  premises and  conclusions are  irrefragable, and they will  think they havo given you a full answer to all by telling you  that it is unfashionable, or, in other words meaning the same  thing, public opinion is against it.    It is said to be hard to  answer a jest; but I am persuaded it would bo harder lo influence by reason lhc slaves of fashion; and it matters not  how vital the interest.    Health, life, country, or the claims  of religion apart, or altogether, weighed against this all-controlling influence, is lighter than vanity.  What heart havo wo then to reason against the present effeminate course of training, when wo are met at every point  by tho declaration, whether true or false, that public opinion,  in this country, is against manual labor.

We have not room to insert their testimony  in their own words, but it will not be amiss to enumerate a  lew among many distinguished names who have spoken out  in iho most unequivocal language. Franklin, Jefferson, John  auincy Adams, Grimky, Dr. Miller, Dr, Green, Dr. Fisk,  Bishop Mcllvane, Dr. Tyng, Dr. Linslcy, and a host of others who might bo mentioned, of tbe most intelligent and  learned of our country. If by public opinion, then, wc mean  tho opinion of the most learned and wise in our nation, it is  decidedly for manual labor. Thousands who rank as oppo-  sers of the system, are only so hypotlit tically: that is to say,  if public sentiment bo against it. These we must set down  as having no weight, as in fact they have no opinion. They  will almost all tell you for themselves they would like the  system, but tho public I I  We acknowledge that there area few of tho green aristocracy of the country, who have not had time to adjust their  views to their new circumstances, who are really opposed to  the system of manual labor in the education of youth. They  have not yet had time in tho bustle of acquisition, to think for  themselves. They havo unfortunately associated in their  minds indolence: and gentility, and if other marks of good  breeding are wanting, tncy arc resolved that llieir cbildi  shall not be wanting in graceful lounging.  But arc these to be the. leaders of public sentiment? Shall  wo leave our first statesmen and scholars, our clearest heads  and best hearts to truckle in the train of this upstart  gentry.  Our farther remarks on physical training will be specially  applicable to schools, as it is here that tho greatest deficiency  exists. While all intelligent men acknowledge that there  should be some regular exercise in schools, to preserve til  health, and strengthen the constitution of students, there is a  great diversity of opinion with regard to the kind and degree  of exercise necessary.  Some suppose that the exercise taken in sports and plays  in times of recess from study, will be sufficient. To this theory there lio thoso objections: First, these sports nre indulged in principally by the younger class of students, leaving thoso more aelvanced in years, and the more studious, who  need it most, without the necessary exercise. In the second  place, such sports are generally too violent, leaving the system in a state of lassitude; and, in the. third place, they arc  far too irregular to constitute invigorating exercise.  Another class of persons suppose that all that is requisite  to induce youth to take the necessary exercise to promote  health, is, to impress their minds with its importance. This  may accomplish the purpose in some rare instances, but in  the great majority it certainly will not. All experience has  proved this. Young men of mature minds will listen to a  lecture on exercise with attention and entire approbation,  make good resolutions, perhaps commence in earnest, and in  a few days give the whole up as a wearisome task.    As a  proof that this theory will not meet the case, there is not lo  be found an institution in the world, where exercise is not a  positive requisition, where it is taken properly.  It follows, then, that it must be a positive law, which tho  students are as much bound to obey as they are to go to recitation. Among those who embrace this theory, there are  three modes selected for its accomplishment.  The first is gymnastic exorcises. As there is but liu]e  said of this mode of exercise in this country, I shall onlv  state a few objections to it. But let it be recollected that the  question is not whether gymnastics are better than no exercise, but whether it bo tho best system that can be suggested,  The objections to tho system are, it is dangerous, as experience has shown. It is unnatural, many of tho movements  being such as we are not likely to havo use for in the occupations of life. It is unphilosophical. There is no employment in which the mind can bo permanently instructed,  which does not produce change in other objects. The child  will amuse itself by the hour in building cob houses and  pushing them down; but will it push the same length of  time against a wall ? No. And why? Because no visible  effects arc produced by tbe effort.  The second plan is to introduce military exercise into literary institutions. To this system there arc many weighty  objections. But let it be observed, that if war be proper in  any case, a nation should have the means of defending itself  And as science constitutes moro than three-fourths of the  strength of an army, it is well to substitute it, instead of animal force. It may not therefore be amiss for every nation to  have at least one well regulated military academy. From  such an institution nn army might at any lime be supplied  with officers. This would give all the benefit of science to  lhc whole army.  But until human butchery becomes tbe appropriate avocation of man, and the military spirit the only one which the  people delight to honor, let not this exercise be introduced  into our schools generally. , j N  The first objection to this system is, it engenders a war  spirit. It is in vain to tell us that the military spirit will engender a patriotism so pure, that all our selfishness will be  absorbed in tho lovo of our country. Facts are stubborn  things, and they speak out on this subject in a language thai  cannot be misconstrued. From whom are the liberties of a  country in most danger, from the industrious cultivator ofthe  soil, the honest tradesman, and mechanic, or from the soldiery? Let all history answer. Theories are sometimes  pretty things, but when they contradict facts they are valueless.  What human nature is in one man, it will be found to be  in most men. I cannot better illustrate the tendency of a  military education to produce a belligerent disposition, than  by relating a fact. A worthy member ofthis Lyceum, in  illustrating the tendency of carrying deadly weapons lo produce quarrels, related this fact in his own experience. His  business called him to walk the streets of Natchez at a late  hour of the night. When on these excursions, he found  himself often beset with dogs. To prepare himself for  these rencounters he armed himself with a pistol.

He now felt himself quite safe, and as  brave as Julius Cresar. When attacked, he found that he  could shoot the dogs with a great deal of ease and safety  But the next feeling was to shoot every dog he saw, whether  attacked by him or not, and especially if there should be  any thing like a menacing growl. Finding the disposition  to shoot became so irrepressible, and the war spirit so in  creased upon him, he concluded to lay aside the pistol.  Let our country, in an unfortunate hour, adopt military  exercise in our seminaries of learning—let a half million  of youth be turned out of such institutions, all with the feel-  ino-so common to military men, a conviction that if they had  the opportunity, they could distinguish themselves, could our  country havo any assurance of the continuance of pence?  Let war occur—let great armies be assembled, and become  accustomed to, and in love with military life—let them, by  the force of discipline, be at tho command of one man, and  who would underwrite for a continuance of our republican  institutions, or our liberties? These are not fancy sketches,  but the lessons of sober experience taught us in history.  Military education is objectionable, in the second place, because it has a tendency to create false notions of honor. It  may be readily guessed that I esteem the spirit of dueling a  false notion of honor. What is true honor ? It is that unswerving principle of integrity, anel justice, which requires  not the promptings of interest or the authority of the civi  magistrate to produce it. If this be true honor, (and who  will deny it?) what has the revenge, or fear of losing character, ol tho duelist to do with it? Just nothing at all. I  need not reason against dueling, for it is one of those fashion-  following principles which can hear no reason. I lake it  for granted that the practice is disapproved by all wise and  good men, even by many who will in an unguarded moment  he drawn into it.  I shall certainly obtain a verdict against military education  by all the members of this association if it can be made to  appear that it fosters that foul spirit. To establish this tendency, we only have to look over the records of AVest Point  Military Academy, and any other institution in the United  States of the same size and age, and if the former has not a  greater proportion of its students who have been engaged in  duels, I will give up the contest.  A third plan is manual labor, either on a farm, or at some  branch ol mechanism. In recommendation of this system  we will say, that it is natural. It is evident that our Maker  intended that man should engage in this exercise, by making  it necessary to his comfort and convenience. Even before  the fall he was required to " dress " and " keep" the garden.  Can man find out a better mode of exercise than he who  made him ?  This system is philosophical. By the changes wrought  in other objects, and tho ingenuity necessary to the performance of the work, the interest of the mind is kept up. It is  useful—increasing personal comforts, and national wealth.  It promotes independence of character. Who is so independent as he who feels that he has resources for competency and  w  comfort within himself. I was once much struck with-  the observation of a poor orphan, who had succeeded in procuring a tolerable education. He was speaking of his destitute condition, and all at once he seemed to take courage, and  said, " I have got my education, and I can make out to get  through the world." It would promote originality. Forming the habit of taxing his own ingenuity for the supply of  his wants, he would be likely to do the same in his mental  operations. It would greatly diminish the expense of education, and by that means bring it within the reach of a  greater number. It would have a grcat tendency to do away  that absurd distinction in society which makes the standing  of a man depend upon his occupation. If there be any reason in our republican institutions, moral, and mental worth,  should constitute the only ground of distinction.  Finally.it would greatly promote morality in our institutions of learning. While idleness is the mother of vice, employment promotes virtue. I have not space to argue these  principles at length, they seem to mc to commend themselves  to every man's understanding.  Before emitting this subject we will notice a few objections.  It is said that manual labor will make the student awkward  and ungraceful in his movements. In reply to this I would  ask whether the mere student is generally remarkable for  his grace? To the charge most book worms will plead not  guilty. The charge against manual labor might be true if  the amount were sufficient to stiffen the limbs, but wher, it is  only to promote health, and strength of body, it will have  just tbe contrary effect.  But it is objected that it will make tho student a sloven.  If this were true, wc should not be without some consolation,  it would not inflict a race of dandies on the world. " Better, infinitely, that the bar, the bench, the halls of legislation,  and the pulpit, should bo filled with men careless of their  appearance, and slovenly in their dress, but whose firm  frames and brawny muscles indicate their sex, and whose  original minds poise themselves on their centre, rather than  to be desecrated by mincing things of powder and perfumery,  nauseous specimens of diluted manhood, scribbling sentimentally in albums, and lisping insipidity."  It is objected, if labor were made a positive requisition, a  youth of high spirit would not submit to it. It is forgotten  by the objector, that the whole college course is a possitive  requisition, but who ever thought that it was proof of a wanl  of high mindedness to submit to the course.  Wo have so protracted our remarks on physical training  that it would bo out of place to enlarge on the intellectual  and moral part of our subject. Physical training only becomes important as it bears directly on these. The amount  of its influence on these is hard to be estimated.  Till the whole of our nature is taken into account in the  education of our youth, the highest capabilities of our nature  will not bo arrived at. It becomes every philanthropist,  patriot, and christian to give his countenance and support to  an improved system of education. In these remarks, I have  been much indebted to a pamphlet written by Rev. Theodore  D. Weld.  .';V|  1.'  k4\  k  fl 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/592	592	593.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/593.jp2

MomHTB, M. li.  The Spaniards, in their conquest of Mexico and Peru, the  only civilized countries on tho American continent, at its dis  covery, like Omar the Turkish emperor, seemed to burn with  an unhallowed zeal to destroy every thing in the conquered  countries, which might perpetuate the history, and even the  memory of the unfortunate nations and empires which they  subverted. Not only their gold and silver; but their government, their cities, their temples, their monuments, their arts,  llieir history, and even their household gods were the objects  uf their insatiable rapine. Whatever art, or refinement, o  even learning, which could not be converted into gold, was  destroyed with a sacrilegious rapacity that would have shamed  the Vandals of Europe.  Hence a mysterious uncertainty rests upon the history ol  these mounds and woiks; which arc the relics of an ancient race of men who have once held dominion in the middle and south-western portion of North America: a race of  men who have long since become extinct; or who, in lhc  fifteenth century had degenerated into savages, who retained  no other knowledge of their ancestors than the most vague  and unsatisfactory traditions. The only true history which  existed of tho American Indians, was doubtless preserved in  tho archives of Mexico and Peru. These by the rapacious  and sacrilegious bigots of Spain were consigned to the obli  vion of a ruthless destruction. Hence the only authentic re  cords which wo have of nations who once inhabited and held  dominion in these regions, are the numerous mounds, embankments, and subterranean works, which are annually  discovered by the advance and enterprise of our settlements.  These, although faithful records of a race of men who  once have existed here, like the hieroglyphics of Egypt  are written in an unknown language to us: and from which  -ve can only glean a few incidental fads, by deciphering now  and then a sign.  Portions ofthe American continent are doubtless us ancient  as corresponding portions of the eastern hemisphere; while  other portions seem to bo of more recent production, either  from the recession of the oceans, or from the action of subterranean fires. Yet even these portions appear to have  been generally occupied by a race of nun who lived long  In-fore even the ancestors ofthe Indians found by Europeans  in the close of the fifteenth century. Whether ihcso monuments have existed for three thousand years, or only for  eight or ten centuries, none can tell: whether they were  once enclosed with walls of brick, or were built of unbiirnt  earth is equally uncertain. One thing is certain, that very  lew erf them now exhibit any traces of any other construction than common earth, if wo except the relics of the dead  which lie concealed in their sides. What changes they have  undergone in the lapse of ages none can tell; but from their  antiquity, the change effected by time upon their external  surfaces must be grcat.  When we take into consideration the vast number of  tumuli, and remains of earth-works which are found through-  out tho great rallies of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers as  well as of their numerous tributaries, wc must admit, that in  ages long past, these regions were peopled by a numerous  enterprising race of men ; who, although they may nol have'  lived in cities built of marble, or have erected temples, and  pyramids of granite, have left monuments of their existence  no less durable than the builders of ancient Babylon. Babylon, with all its walls, its to wers, and temples has disappeared  and left no record of ils mighty founders, than what has been  preserved on the page of history. In America the historic  page has boon destroyed, and not a sentence left; but the imperishable monuments, without number, proclaim tho former  existence of a numerous and great people who have kni"  ceased to exist.  As to a knowledge of ihis people, who, or what they were,  speculation alone can supply the void left by history. They  may have been like the innumerable tribes who inhabit tho  northern parts of Europe and Asia, a nomadic race, of shepherds and warriors, who likewise cultivated the fertile vallies  to sustain their numerous population ; and although, like the.,  Cossacks, Tartars, and Mongols of Asia, they may have  dwelt also in cities and towns; still unlike the shepherd  kings of Egypt, or the immortal builders of Thebes on the  Nile, they were unused to the labors of mines and quarries;  and unskilled in the art of piling "P huge masses of granite,  and imperishable rock. Yet they had their monuments:  and whether, to commemorate great events; to perpetuate tin:  memory of their friends and kings; or to serve as high places for the rites of their religion, they still remain, although  less magnificent, yet not less durable than the mighty pyramids of Egypt, or the temples and monuments of the hundred-  gated Thebes. Their cities, which doubtless they had, were;  of a temporary nature; built of wood and other perishable  materials, which have long since mouldered to earth, and  forest trees, to tho tenth generation may have waved over  their ruins,  The purpose for which these mounds and works were  erected is also problematical. However, we are led to infer,  that they wero erected for various purposes; some for temples ; some for mausoleums; some for common cemeteries:  some for monuments , and some for defences. These purposes may be determined by their size, shape, and relative  position. Mounds indicating all theso purposes, except tin-  last, arc formed over all the level, fertile, nnd habitable regions of the north-western and south-western states; and appear to have been erected without any regard to defensive  operations. Many of them indeed are located in the most  issailable situations. Even those which are surrounded by  embankments of earth, may have been enclosed, to render  them more sacred, especially those for general burial places,  or the mausoleum of their lamented kings and chiefs. Some-  which now exhibit no enclosures, may originally have been  enclosed with trees, shrubbery and the like, which have dis-  ippeared. Others which exhibit no embankments now, may  have been enclosed originally by walls, which have mouldered  into dust, and become levelled with tho ground by the same  ever active agent which has probably reduced these mounds  to less than half their original size. 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/593	593	594.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/594.jp2

N A L.  220  The comparatively small number of skeletons found in those  mounds which havo boon appropriated to sepulture, show  that large quantities of earth wore atlded with each additional  body.    These skeletons, such at least as retain the form ol  bone, nre found at different depths from the base up to the  summit; they arc found near the centre and near the surface.  Hence we infer tho mounds were erected by a succession of  burials, commencing with a layer first upon the ground with  a small tumulus of a few feet over the first body:—then the  next at its side raised to nn equal height and joined to the  first: then another in the same way, and another until the  base was of proper dimensions.    When this is done the first  layer is completed, and the next is placed upon the first tumu  his, with an additional pile of earth gradually receding with  its external side into the pyramid form.    In this manner one  layer after another may have been completed year after year,  until in the lapse of one or two ages one mound would be completed, and remain a grand mausoleum, not for one person on.  Iy, but for generations.    Many of them are found with but a  few feet elevation above the ground; and such were evidently left in an unfinished state j—and lime, and the action of■  rains have in some measure leveled their surface.    It is not  uncommon, in tho fine arable lands of tho bayous and lakes  of Louisiana, to meet with several largo mounds near each  other, and ono or more of less than half the size of the lar  gest; being in all probability one that was in a state of being  erected when the final catastrophe ofthe nation was consummated.    Again within  one or more miles of some large  mounds, wo may occasionally find several others, all of whicl  are small and imperfect; and indicating the probability that  lhc old burying place was completeel and consigned to inviolate sanctity, while new ones were in use.    In one instance  on lhc Roundaway bayou these small ones arc near two miles  from the larger ones, and upon a higlialluvial ridge of a half!  mile in width   extending back into  the swamp; probably  selected as a moro retired spot for those sacred relics.   Possibly they may have been hastily erected to cover the bodies  of a little host of heroes who may have fallen in battle, or  been slain in ambuscade, where they received a hasty burial  after the nude'.  In the valley of the lower Mississippi these tumuli are  frequent in the finest arable level lands; and are seldom seen  in tho hilly regions except in high flats. I havo never seen  one in sterile lands, although they were beautifully situated.  Tho mounds and works point out the regions which contained a dense population many centuries ago; while barren flats,  having been then as they arc now, unproductive, show no signs  ol'a former race; having been reserved for gamcand pasturage.  In the lower valley of the Mississippi these tumuli observe  a regular form, with very few exceptions. This form is almost uniformly a regular parallelogram at the base, rising in  in a pyramidal form to the surface or terrace, which is generally fiat and level. They are mostly oblong, being about  one third longer than their width. Thoso found near the  hanks of tho old river lakes, and tho bayous, are from forty  to two hundred feet long, and from thirty to ono hundred feet  m width ; and from ten to fifty feet high. Tho area of the  top or terrace is about one half of the base.  In shape these vary materially from those so common  in the north-western states anel territories. Tho latter are  mostly round, of a conical shape, and often much higher than  those in the south. This difference in the form of the works,  especially south of Tennessee, is sufficient to indicate a different race of men as the builders of each. The difference  in the form is too remarkable to have been the result of any  accidental cause. Again, the earthen wall or embankment  surrounding them is much more common in the north than  in the southern portion of this valley: in the south embankments about the mounds are uncommon ; while in the north  these embankments even occur where there is no mound.  The pyramidal square mound occurs in considerable numbers in the fertile alluvial bottoms as far east as Pearl river,  and probably to East Florida.  Many of these mounds we have said wero probably creeled as sacred places of sepulture for their tribes or chief:-.  This is a mode of burial not unknown to history, among the  tribes of the eastern hemisphere. It is a custom which hn-  becn more or less in use among semi-barbarian people in all  ages. As Major Stoddart observes, " Many of the ancient  nations buried their dead in this way; especially those oi  distinction and consideration among them. Iceland still exhibits the remains of tumuli; and, according to the drawings  made of them, they appear to resemble thoso of the Missi::  sippi valley. Plutarch says that Alexander, on the death ol  Demaratus, maelo a most magnificent funeral for him, his  whole army raising him a monument of earth eight cubits  high, and of vast circumference. The Scythians, according  to Herodotus, labored to raise as high a monument of earth  for llieir dead as possible. Seniiraniis endeavored to eternize,  tho memory of Niuus, her husband, by raising a high and  broad mound for his tomb. Tho same practice! obtained  among the Spartans and Thracians, and even among the  Jews. * * * * All rude and uncultivated nations have  raised these pyramids of earth, either as cenotaphs or mausoleums to tho memory of those they respected."—Sketches of  Louisiana, p. 351.  When wc reflect upon this mode, as practised by the American tribes, as well as those of the eastern hemisphere, compared with the mode adopted by ourselves in common country burying grounds, wc cannot repress our admiration ot  the superior moile of the former. We wish to hold our  burial grounds equally sacred; and equally desire to perpetuate the memory of our friends and ancestors: yet very  often a few diminutive hillocks, which will be completely  obliterated in half a century, are all that remain to mark the  spot where hundreds of our friends lie buried: and in the  lapse of a few years, their bones may be trodden under foui  and desecrated by the plough ; while tho funeral places ol  these ancient barbarians still exist, and perpetuate the memory of their race, long after all tradition and historical legends  have been lost in obscurity.  Some are evidently the remains of fortified places, or enclosed for better defence. Others may have been mounds  for temples or altars for tlio rites of their religion, enclosed  wilh earthen walls made of burnt or unburnt brick, which  has mouldered to its original earth.

M. Pike, in his passage from Santa Fe to the  United States. Those which have been forts or fortified  places for troops in war, are comparatively lew in the south ;  and when found, they arc generally in positions not easily  accessible; or situated at some convenient point of communication. One of each kind we will briefly describe. The  first is situated upon the plantation of Walter Irvin, Esq.,  about ten miles north-east from Natchez, and about seven  mill s in a direct line from the Mississippi river. This is  probably one of the most remarkable works of tho kind to  be found in the south-west. It is situated upon an elevated  summit of ground, in the centre of an amphitheatre of hills,  of the same elevation on all sides. From the base of the  summit upon which the works are situated, the ground has a  gradual, but irregular and uneven descent for six or eight  hundred yards, except on the cast, a narrow ridge extends  from the base of the works to the hills at tho distance of half  a mile. This whole region is constituted of yellow clay, or  loam; sand, gravel, or rock are not found near. The mound  is very large, erected upon the summit by excavating around  the base, and carrying upon top: the excavation has been  much more extensive at the west and east ends than at the  sides, which face tho north and south. The extent of tho  base of the main mound is two hundred yards by one hundred and twenty yards, with an elevation of the main terrace  of twenty-five or thirty-five feet, with an irregular outline,  somewhat similar to the salient angles of modern fortifications; these angles or projections are much larger on the  south-west and north-west corners than elsewhere. The  area upon the top, including the base of a super-tumulus upon Ihe west end, as well as one on the east end, is about three  acres, while the area of the main mound around the base is  live acres. The greatest length of the base is two hundred  yards, and of the top about one hundred and twenty yards.  The sides of the main mound are quite steep, being not more  than thirty-five or forty degrees from a perpendicular. Upon iho top of the main mound are six other mounds; ono  large one on the west end, and another smaller on the east  end; two smaller ones are situated upon the north side and  two upon the south. The largest at its base covers an area  of one fourth of an acre, while its level surface on top ofthe  terrace is about one-third as much. This supertumulus has  its western side or slope continuous with tho main mound,  above which it rises about forty or forty-five feet. From its  top down to the bottom of tho excavation at the west end, is  eighty feet. The mound upon the east end is similar to the  western, but not one-fourth as large, having its eastern slope  continuous with the side of tho main mound fifty feet to the  excavation below. Tho others are quite small, beinn- not  more than fifteen or twenty feet in diameter across the base,  and not more than three or four feet high, although they have  been much higher. Those on the north side are largest, and  are not more than twenty feet apart, being situated on each  side of a ravine from the terrace down to the base, which appears to be the remains of a covert way or entrance. Those  on tho south are more remote, but appear on each side of a  smaller ravine towards tho west of the south side, which also  appears to have been likewise a covert way. The larger of  these covert ways appears to have entered near ihe centre of  the great terrace, through the body of the work; the other  appears to have entered nearer the circumlerence, about two  thirds of the distance towards the west end. On the north  side, about fifty or sixty feet from the base of the mound  there appears to have been a large bastion to defend the entrance; a similar, but smaller one appears to have defended  the other entrance on the south-east. Close around the base  of the mound, on all sides, there are the remains of a deep  and wide ditch or fosse, part of which, fifteen years ago, contained water: but of late has become nearly level.  This has been a vast work, and probably combined in itself at the same time a fortress and a temple for tho worship of  some divinity, probably of the sun. The smaller supertumulus on the east end may have typified the rising sun; and the  larger one on the west may have typified the intensei light  before he sank to rest behind the western hills. On these, as  altars and high places, may have burned the sacred fire,  which they worshipped as emanations from their divinity.  Here too may have been the residence and the tombs of a  long line of kings, who once held dominion here; and here  too may have been the seat of their power and the great  source of their religious rites and ceremonies. And, finally,  the whole may havo fallen in some desperate assault, and left  its surface and out-works strewed with the bodies of its defenders, and with the implements of warfare, and the sacred  emblems of their religion.  Whatever may have been the use for which it was i: tended  by tho original builders, it has evidently been a placeof grcat  strength against all kinds of military machinations, unaided  by gunpowder and artillery. From either supertumulus ihe  eye could take in every object round for a mile', and surprise  of course was impossible; the ascent on all sides made assault  almost impracticable, and exceedingly hazardous. Slill it  must have fallen by assault or strategem. Ils surface has  been and even ye: is thickly strewn with human bones, and  the relics of implements of warfare and of art; which have  become covered in part by the earthy detritus and rubbish.  About this mound various remains of earthenware, and of  implements of warfare have been found, besides numerous  skeletons. Some years since, the skeleton of an individual  who would have measured seven or eight feet high and large  in proportion, was found here, upon the main mound. A  more recent examination resulted in the discovery of several  skeletons of common size lying promiscuously on the top ol  the main mound near the western base of the eastern supertumulus. These were found within a few inches of the surface, where doubtless they had been covered by the detritus  upon them. These skeletons exhibited such evidences of  great antiquity, that they soon fell to pieces when exposed to  the air. One skull only with grcat care was preserved sufficiently entire to admit of a true drawing for an engraving.  This skull was decidedly of the "flat-head," or compressed  kind; the occiput being greatly compressed or elevated,  while the parietal bones were proportionally full and elevated.  Besides these, on the top of the eastern supertumulus, were 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/595	595	596.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/596.jp2

SOUTH-WESTERN   JOURNAL.  231  discovered in a circular cavity, about twelve inches in diameter, and not more than fifteen inches below the surface, the  ashes and remains of a funeral pyre; being the remains of  burnt bones and other animal matters, calcined and enclosed  in a strong cloth of round coarse texture, entirely unlike  modern manufacture. Similar remains wero recently discovered by John Routh, Esq., in opening the surface of a mound  upon his plantation on Lake St. Joseph. These relics prove  clearly that those who built these monuments, sometimes at  least, adopted tho custom which has so long prevailed in the  eastern parts of Europe and in Asia, of consuming by fire  the remains of their friends and entombing their ashes.  Another work of the same nature is to be found in the angle formed by tho junction of Little river with the Washita  or Black river of Louisiana. The land on which this work  is situated, like that for many miles on every side, is firm alluvion, above ordinary inundation. The plan of the work,  as well us the position selected for it, show that it has been a  fortified place. Major Stoddarl, who visited it about the year  1810, gives the following description of these works, as they  appeared twenty-eight years ago. He says there were five  mounds enclosed by a wall or embankment of earth, at that  time ten feet high and ten feet thick. Tho earthen wall enclosed about two hundred acres of ground. Four of tho  mounds were of nearly equal dimensions, being about three  hundred feet long, one hundred feet broad, anel twenty feet  high, of a square or parallelogram form at the base, and diminishing towards the top in tho pyramid shape. Tho fifth  appeared to have been designed as a tower or turret, the base  of which covered an acre of ground. It rose by two steps or  stories, each gradually diminishing from its base upwards.  The summit of the upper story was crowned with a flattened  cone about eighty feet above the base. These works, in all  probability, were designed also as a place of deposite for the  dead.    See Sketches of Louisiana, p. 350.  But who were the people that built these monuments, nnd  dwelt in these lands which wo now inhabit? Their name  and origin is unknown; but they were semi-civilized, numerous and laborious. Possibly they were the parent stock  from which the Peruvians and Mexicans originally separated  about two thousand years ago; the parent stock also from  which tho Toltecs afterwards separated about the middle of  the seventh century; and from which also came ihe Aztecs  in tho thirteenth century. It would be tedious to trace all the  reasons for such a conjecture. Where are they now ? Forgotten and unknown, they lie'buried in these monuments of  earth, where they were deposited probably, long, long before  the European first set foot upon America. The blastin  breath of time has swept over them, as it did over the lands  of Chaldea and Assyria; and a new race have sprung up,  which, posssibly by the same influence, in ten or fifteen centuries, may have likewise passed away; when the remains of  our monuments may be mere themes of conjecture.  This continent has been called the "New World;" but is  it not old? How many physical revolutions may have passed over it before its discovery by Europeans, for forty centuries, none can toll. Who can unroll the scroll of its history,  or mark the eras of its existence since the creation?    Who  can read the tablet upon which the records of unnumbered  centuries are written, and tell us of all the mighty deeds ol  conquest and empire, which have diversified its political existence, while it remained unknown to Europeans? Read  the tablets that lie buried under the surface of the earth, and  those that rear their heads above, and they will tell you ol  cities, nations, and mighty empires, which were coeval with  Babylon and Tyre,  INAUGURAL ADDRESS  or j. w. Monette, M. U„ before the Jefferson Collego and Washington Lyceum.  Gentlemen on the Lyceum :  After tho short notice I have received, and the continued  engagements of a different nature, it can hardly be expected  that I should have prepared a fin mat address upon this occasion : yet, belore entering upon the duties assigned me by the  constitution of our society, I may be pennitled lo express my  acknowledgements for the honor conferred, and the confidence implied, by electing me to preside over the meetings  and deliberations of this learned association. The best evidence, however, which I can give you of my gralitudc for  this expression of your confidence, will be in the faithful performance of tho duties incumbent upon mc; and in the continued zeal 1 may evince to promote the interests, and advance  the reputation of our association. This shall be ilone to the  extent of my feeble abilities: but I must beg your favorable  predilections, and your indulgence ; and so much the more,  as I have been preceded m the office by one who is so well  qualified, and has so ably discharged the duties which are A  now committed to my hands.  Our institution has now existed for nearly three years, with  a gradual advance of character, and an accession of useful and  learned members. The small band which founded this association under difficulties mid discouragements, has in some  degree surmounted them, and has now become a literary and  scientific corps, which may bo an honor to the state, and may  in some small degree, advance the interests of science. It is'  not chimerical to suppose, that our association, now comparatively small, may be the nucleus, around which may be gathered, in less than a quarter of a century, a host of worthies,  whoso names shall bo registered as distinguished collabora-  teurs in the field of knowledge.  The kind feelings and the liberality with which we have  been sustained by the generous public in our efforts to establish the first literary periodical in the state, the " South-Western Journal," give a pleasing assurance that wc shall still  have their aid and approbation ; and that ultimately we shall  not fail to receive the highest reward of virtuous enterprise,  the smiles of Divine Providence, and the approbation of the  good and wise.  The object of our association is not unknown. We make  no pretensions to extraordinary talent or learning: we do  not set ourselves up as models of virtue or knowledge: but  we are what we profess to be, an association of men of respectable attainments in literature, science, and general knowledge, for the purpose of cultivating a taste for literary pursuits, and intellectual exercises; for cultivating our minds,  and storing them with useful knowedge; while at tho same  to  4  .'u  "I  -/' 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/596	596	597.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/597.jp2

Thus like all other joint-stock nsso-  ciations, our design is to benefit on rselres, and probably to confer some advantages upon those whoso favor wo desire to  secure:—-with this exception, that if we fail and prove bankrupt in our enterprise, we wrong none, and the community at  largo will not havo to bear the. burden.  There is much lo be done in improving the public taste, in  correcting the vitiated habits of the reading multitude, and to  excite the latent genius of our south-western states. How  •liter, do we see young men of talent nnd acquirements, once  ispirants for literary honors and fame, seduced from tho paths  if literature, and intellectual pursuits, by that grcat demora  izing principle, tho inordinate desire of wealth, until their  lovo of learning, and ihe fire of their holy ambition, is for  ,-ver quenched by the chilling flood of avarice? For want  ■ if some intellectual feast to allure them, or some amusement  M regale their finer feelings, they yield to the seducing allurements of vice and dissipation, until despair spreads her lurid  mantle over their ruined prospects:—or, for want of some  allurement and associates in tho paths of knowledge, the  most exalted powers of mind have been prostituted to the  most ignoble purposes, and are tied down to the incessant  strivings of avarice. It is our object to guard against these  'liings, and to fortify ourselves and those who may unite with  us, against these insidious foes, while we cultivate those intellectual enjoyments, which are only excelled by the pure and  ■•hastening influence of religion.  The few hours which may be devoted to our literary exercises occasionally, or to the researches connected therewith,  ire not unprofitably spent; they are not hours misapplied, to  which in subsequent years wo will recur with regret: but  they nre hours to which we can look with fond recollection,  is hours profitably spent in a necessary relaxation from the  vexations and toils of ordinary business; by which our  minds are improved, and our hearts bettered. Bet us thcrc-  •r,re give a portion of our time to the cultivation of our minds,  and to improvement in literature, arts, and sciences; and we  shall find it the guardian angel which drives the obtrusive  money-changers out of the temple of tho mind, nnd leaves it  in possession of every human virtue.  1: we wish our association to prosper, wo must individually feel an ardent zeal for its prosperity, and our works must  be the test of our zeal. Let each member feel that ho is in  honor bound to perform the duties assigned him : thnt the  obligations, under which ho has voluntarily placed himself,  require of him a strict performance of these duties; without  which he cannot acquit himself honorably of his obligations.  Lot each ono be assured, that delinquency in these matters,  is but the evidence of a tendency to still greater delinquencies in moral obligation, which cannot be too much avoided.  If these arc our feelings and our determination, our association will, it must, and with the blessing of Divine Providence,  it cannot fail to prosper.  1 ientlemen, nothing shall be wanting on my part, to ct-;vi..  charqeter and dignity to our institution, so far as my feeble  abilities can eflect that object: but I ask your aid, and your  zealous co-operation, to accomplish this desirable end. With-  out this our association cannot prosper, or bo productive of  such advantages lo us individually as we all must desire  The obligations imposed by our association is a salutary  stimulus to industry and exertion in tho extension of our researches, and in the acquisition of knowledge: a stimulus  which all require, otherwise they will settle down into indu-  lencc in their literary exercises and acquirements; and instead of advancing in ihe paths of science and literature, thev  will retrograde, and lose not only the acquisitions whicii  they have made in their earlier scholastic years, but will  even lose their taste for intellectual pursuits and forfeit all  claims to their former well merited literary and scientific  honors.  REVIEW.  Vegetable Diet; nee snilctlollcil by medical men, anil by G-xpcrloncQ ill all Bgci,  By Willi.iii, A. Alcou.  pp. 970.   Boston | starch. Capon te J.yon,  1803.  That life may sometimes bo prolonged, and health promoted, by confinement to vegetable diet, probably no man of  reflection will question. But that total abstinence from animal food is in all cases demanded by the laws of our physical nature, is more than any man of sound mind will contend  for. Animals were created, and given to man for food as well  as for other uses, by Him who made man ; and they may be  so used, under tho direction of an enlightened judgment, nut  only with impunity, but with positive benefit. It is sheer  fanaticism that proscribes a whole class of heaven's bounties  to the whole race of man, on the ground that lo some consli-  tutions, and to some individuals positively diseased, they arc  noxious. A mixed diet is called for by nature when healthy;  and none of llioso articles of food which appetite selects, arc  worthy to be condemned, however censurable may be an immoderate indulgence in the use of them. Indeed wc are  led to this conclusion by a cursory examination ofthe volume  now before us; although the evident design of it is to press  the paramount claims of vegetable over animal food. Tho  opinions of scientific and practical physicians, scattered over  the land, and the experience of distinguished men in the various departments of life, are worthy of great respect ainl  confidence', on every subject pertaining to the health of tin-  body and the mind. And here they arc collected and duly  arrayed, and commented on with great skill; but, after all,  men will eat flesh, as the patriarchs and the prophets anil  the apostles did, "asking no questions for conscience sake,  and were fully justified to their own consciences in eating  whatever is set before them. It is neither possible nor desirable to change tho "course of the world," in regard to the  nature of their food, but the physiologist renders an important service to mankind, when he unites with the theologian  in pressing the duty of moderation; and when he exposes errors in tho prevailing modes of preparing food, and the indulgence of appetite : and urges on man the duty, whether  they cat or drink, or whatever they do, to do all to the glory  of (Jod.—Boston Recorder.

VotjNci Gentlemen :  Standing, as you do this day, but one remove from the high  honor of being4ho first-born of your Alma Mater, to you the  present must be an occasion of deep interest. Fond memo-  rv and joyous anticipation are no doubt actively engaged,  enriching with their choicest treasures this brief, but consecrated hour. Gladly could I roam with you through those  flowery meads, redolent wilh the fragrance of the past, or  richly enameled with enlivening anticipations ofthe future.  Such a ramble might, on this occasion, be most agreeable  and interesting to you, to me, and to all who nre present.  Slill, however, employment of a different kind may be more  profitable. And, as your education, during the period of  your connexion with the college of Louisiana, has regarded  utility rather than entertainment, substance rather than show,  it may be no less proper in itself, than in accordance with reasonable expectations, that the finish should correspond lo the  body of the structure.  Permit me, then, on this occasion, so replete with interest,  on this hour, around which cluster SO many associations, rich  wilh all iho vernal fragrance of memory, and lhc summer  brightness of anticipation, to fix your attention for a few mo-  menls on n subject fraught with Utility.  The Supremacy of Law is a topic, which, in all its connexions and bearings, involves the happiness of mankind in  every way, in which it is possible for happiness to be enjoyed,  A little reflection will convince even the superficial observer, that the universe, wilh every particle of matter which it  contains, is governed by laws that are fixed and uniform in  their operation. The tendency of fire is always to burn combustible substances; that of poison is to destroy, and that of  wholesome food is to support animal life. These tendencies  may be counteracted by the intervention of other and adequate causes; but they are never destroyed. Tho gravity of  a cork is no less, when it ascends through water, than when  it descends through the atmosphere.  Look where we may through all the dominions of matter  and of mind, the correctness ofthe foregoing sentiment is easily discovered. It will readily be granted, that there may  be found apparent exceptions to the uniformity of the opera-  lion of Nature's laws. Slill, however, those exceptions, when  properly understood, will no doubt prove to be so many confirmations of the rule.  Take an example. Iron sinks in water; and, yet, such a  form may be given to it, as will cause it to swim on the surface wilh great buoyancy. Now, it is manifest to every tyro  in philosophy, that there is no want of uniformity here; but,  'hat the very same law, which causes the iron to sink in the  one instance, causes it to float in the oilier.  Exceptions, then, to Nature's laws may be regarded as anchor name for our ignorance of those laws, or of the manner  'a which they operate in any given case.  All the rich stores of happiness, that God has treasured up  m the universe for his sensitive creation, are contained in his"  various laws, and can be enjoyed in no other way, than  through the uniformity of their operation.  Hence, if we would enjoy any blessing in the whole range  of Heaven's gifts, we must place ourselves in harmony with  those laws, through the uniform operation of which, that  blessing is to be enjoyed. Without food of some kind there  can be no nutrition. There is no way, in which the benefit  of medicine can be enjoyed, unless it is introduced into the  system.  Whether the harmony in question be wilfully disregarded  or ignorantly overlooked, in either case, misery, to a certain  degree, is the inevitable result. Thus, within a certain distance, fire imparts a grateful nnd refreshing warmth ; but this  can only lake place in harmony with those laws which have  been impressed on it, and us, by our Great Creator. Disregard those laws, and vitality immediately suffers, if it be not  destroyed, by the intensity of cold on the one hand, or of heat  on the other.  Even the most superficial thinker may be convinced by a  passing glance, that, were the laws of Nature not thus uniform in their operation, all certainty, or even reasonable expectation of human happiness would be nt once annihilated,  Who does not perceive that existence would bo intolerable, if  it were altogether uncertain, whether the effects of arsenic or  of bread, would result from whatever entered into the mouth;  and whether to come in contact wilh those whom we delight  to cherish as bosom friends, might not be the same as to tread  on a deadly serpent?  It is thus manifest, that if the laws of nature were not uniform in their operation, it would be impossible to make either  calculations or efforts for the promotion of our own happiness,  or of that of our fellow-men.  Every law, under which man is placed by his Creator,  tends to promote his happiness, when properly understood,  and strictly obeyed. How vain, then, the complaints of Nature's rebels against the severity of those laws, which are  manifestly designed for llieir happiness, and without which  there could be no enjoyment. Whereas, misery results, and  an result, only from their violation. The lawless and disobedient are, therefore, alike rebels against God, and traitors  to their own happiness.  A hearty and practical reception of this truth, would, in a  little time, convert this desert into a paradise, this valley of  wo into a garden of delights. On the other hand, a lawless  spirit of self-will must, to the very same extent to which it is  indulged, be productive of misery. If a man, either through  ignorance or disregard of the law of gravitation, steps off a  precipice one hundred feet high, not all the created power in  the Universe, can save him from destruction.  Hence, it is manifest, that there is no other way of securing  happiness, "our being's end and aim," than by acting in harmony with tho laws of our Creator. Such action presupposes a knowledge of the laws in question. Consequently,  a knowledge of the laws of Nature, under which we are  placed, and a course of conduct in harmony with that knowledge, are necessary for the perfection of human happiness.  Inasmuch, then, as a law-abiding spirit involves the well-  being ofthe whole human race,  it is no wonder,     ul   it  VOL.

The foregoing principles are applicable, in their full extent, only to the divine laws ; fur they alone are unerring,  Nevertheless they have a modified and very important relation to such laws as are measurably of human origin, and  of a conventional character. Laws of this sort are all designed to promote the happiness of those for whom they arc  enacted. To accomplish this object, however, they must be  in accordance with the nature of man, and with his various  relations at the time and place for which they are designed.  Social laws, when thus constructed, are obviously neither  more nor less than an acknowledgment of tho natural laws,  and a conventional stipulation to abide by them, under pain  of a given penalty. In all such cases it is no less manifest,  that misery must necessarily result from transgression, than  that a heavy body, unsupported, must, by the law of gravitation, fall to the ground.  " They despise government," is as certain an indication of  characters destined to utter ruin, as any that can be furnished  in tho whole range of human thought, or human language.  Since, then, tho lawless are self-doomed to destruction, in all  their relations and interests, human happiness is obviously  identified with the cultivation of a law-abiding spirit, and  with the extinction of an arbitrary and self-willed temper-  Hence, sound philosophy teaches tbe importance of a cheerful submission to t'.ose laws, under which for the time beiiu  wo may be placed.  This remark is intended to apply, not merely to laws of  acknowledged utility, but even to such as may be unwise and  inexpedient. A given law may, it is true, operate injuriously  upon our interests; yet the injury may be of a subordinate  and local character, and bear no comparison to lhc much  greater amount of injury which a violation of the law in  question wculd necessarily inflict on us and others, by the  cultivation of a lawless and arbitrary spirit.  Hence, government of some kind necessarily results from  man's organization and circumstances in the world; and  therefore, whatever may bo said relative to its peculiar form,  as to the thing itself, "there is no power but of God: the  powers that be are ordained ol God. Whosoever, therefore,  rcsisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they  that resist, shall receive to themselves condemnation."  Let none, however, misapprehend my meaning. When  en earthly despot, in any relation of life, dares to enjoin  what God forbids, or to forbid what God enjoins, resistance  becomes a duty, and obedience a crime.  By resistance, in such a case, the rule is exemplified, not  violated. " Let every soul be subject to the higher powers,"  is the rule. This is manifestly infringed when wo disobey  God, who is the highest power—and himself the fountain of  all dominion—that we may obey an earthly ruler, who is at  best but subordinate, and, in this instance, a despot and a  usurper.     Disobedience, in such a case, proceeds from, and  tends to cherish, not a lawless, but a law-abiding spirit a  determination to be subject to the highest powers, at every  risk, that may be incurred, through the displeasure of those  whose authority is subordinate.  Law, then, must be supreme. And the very existence of  the world in which we live, is not more undeniable:, than that  it is utterly impossible, for any society that will not sustain  the supremacy of law, to attain to the perfection of human  lappiness.  When these principles are generally understood and appro,  dated as they should be, the good order of sociely will nu  longer be interrupted by the shameless brawls of drunken  lawless rowdyism. No longer will brute violence usurp the  empire of law and reason. Neither will unbridled insolence  ny more, with his hideous, brazen front, intrude upon the  sanctity anil disturb the peace of the domestic circle. Under  the supremacy of omnipotent law, tranquillity and good order will extend their heavenly influence to all the interests,  and through all the ramifications of society. Violence will  no more be heard in our land, wasting nor destruction within  our borders; but, in their stead, tho spontaneous chorus of  universal nature will be—" Glory to God in the highest heavens, on earth peace, good will to men."  Who, that has a heart warmed by one spark ol generous  and lofty feeling, is not ready to exclaim—Oh I consummation, devoutly to be wished! Thrice happy he, who shall  live to see thoo accomplished I  Ere this state of things, however, can be introduced, it is  manifest to the reflecting inind, that a radical change must  take place in tho habits of the community, and especially  with reference to tho education of youth.  Solomon once said, that folly was bound up in the heart of  a child, and that the rod and reproof brought wisdom. In  this ago of universal improvement, we have discovered that  Solomon was a fool; that wisdom is bound up in the heart ol'  a child, and thai, in the education of tbe young, the rod and  reproof do no good, but nnniiiigled mischief. We have discovered, that every little urchin, so soon as he can crawl—so  soon as ho can curse and swcai, drink ardent spirits, smoke  segars, and chew tobacco—is wiser tl: .;i all his teachers;  and, consequently, that to him correction and the restraints  of a wholesome discipline are unnecessary, and a great evil.  Hence, even in the nursery, the little darling must have his  own way, to the great annoyance of the family, and of all  tho friends by whom they may be visited. When he is old  enough to be sent to school, there also, if practicable, lie  must be allowed to have his own way. The grand object is  to limit his teacher as far as possible, and, in every difficulty  that occurs, to take the part of the dear oppressed boy, and rail  out against the teacher as guilty of cruelly, tyranny, and oppression. In such circumstances, his connexion with the institution is worse than unprofitable, both to himself and to all  concerned. By and by, he leaves school, about as ignorant  as when he entered it, but ten times more depraved and incorrigible ; and then he struts forth on the stage of manhood,  there to play out a consistent part. Accustomed from his infancy to despise government—to regard no restraint, no rule  of conduct but his own lawless and arbitrary will—it is not  to be expected, that he will become a good and sober citizen,  a supporter of tho laws and institutions of his country.

Looking not to the Mgis of virtue, and  ihe supremacy of law for proteclion, but armed with the instruments of violence, and the concealed weapons of assassination, he enters upon his ignoble career. Tho gambling  table and the grog-shop nre his daily haunts. He revels, bullies, and gets drunk. In swaggering, sottish insolence, he insults his fellow-man, perhaps his bosom friend, and either  gets killed himself, or plunges the dagger into a brother's  heart, and terminates on the scaffold his inglorious race. To  all within the reach of his influence, he lives a curse, and  dies detested.  Who shall be charged with this fearful ruin of an undy-  in" spirit? Doating mother, indulgent, but misguided father  —you have done the fearful deed. By allowing your son to  grow up in the indulgence of a lawless and self-willed spirit,  you did what you could to educate him for disgrace and mise  ry throughout the whole duration of his future existence  Were this ruin, which has been caused by your foolish indul  gence, confined to the present life, however appalling in real  ity it may be, it would sink into comparative insignificance  But how shall we estimate the untold fierceness of that tempest of wrath and wretchedness, by which the lawless spirit  will be driven and tossed through all eternity? And this incalculable ruin has all been effected by your foolish indulgence. When fire shall havo ceased to burn, and water to  drown, then—but not till then—may you rationally hope for  different results from the system of education, alas I too prevalent, and too popular in this deluded age.  Before high heaven I conjure you this day, fellow-citizens,  one and all,—parents, guardians, trustees, students—unite  with us in one vigorous and persevering effort to stem this  fearful tide of self-will, anarchy, and lawless violence, which  threatens to deluge the land, and overwhelm our dearest earthly interests, our institutions anel our laws, in an abyss of wide-  spreading desolation.  To you, young gentlemen, who have this day received the  well-earned meed of academic honors, this subject addresses  itself with peculiar force. Your education and circumstances  in life, will put il in your power to be the means of much  good or much evil to your fellow men. Do you nobly aspire  to be pre-eminent, not in mischief, but in doing good? Are  youi generous souls fired with a laudable ambition to pursue  such a course, as will reflect honor on your Alma Mater, promote your own happiness, and secure to society at large a  rich harvest of untold blessings? If so, I know not any  method by which you can more certainly accomplish these  objects, than by cultivating in yourselves, and in all who may  come within the sphere of your influence, a profound reve-  rencc for tho supremacy of law.  In this respect, society must be reformed, radically re  formed, or we are undone. Unless this desolating torrent of  self-will, lawlessness, and anarchy, can be arrested in its fear-  ful course, I hazard nothing in the prediction, that less than  half a century will see our schools, colleges, and free mstilu-  tions buried in one mass of promiscuous rum. We call upon you, therefore, young gentlemen, by your love of country,  and your affection for your Alma Mater, to lend us a help-  ing hand in this good work of reformation. At every risk,  and by all the means in your power, discountenance this demoniac spirit of lawlessness, wherever it may be found.  By pursuing this course, you may not gain as much popularity in some circles, as you would, were you to drink with  the drunken, and riot with the rowdy. But, my young  friends, though a lawless brood, the offspring of that old serpent, the devil, may hiss at you, true honor, unfading-laurels,  riches that ne'er decay, will be your noble reward. You will  secure tho favor of the wise and the good, the testimony of  an approving conscience, nnd the smiles of your Heavenly  Father.  I should feel, that I had neglected the most important part  of my duty, were I, on this interesting occasion, to oveilook  an application of the foregoing principles, which is by far  tho most important of which the human mind can form any  conception. Their value, when applied to man as a physical, organic, and intellectual being, however immense in itself, becomes as nothing, when compared with their pre-eminent importance, taken in connexion with man as a religious  being, viewed in relation to God, and a flit re state of existence.  That man is elevated to an immeasurable distance above  tho most perfect of the brute creation, by the possession of religious faculties, which have a direct reference to God, and to  a future state of existence, cannot fairly be questioned.  If, then, man does indeed possess religious faculties—and,  especially, if those faculties are the noblest and most authoritative in his nature—it must be evident to every reflecting j  mind, that the principles already laid down, when taken ivM  this connexion, have a tremendous importance. The happiness or misery to which man is heir, as a religious being, infinitely surpasses the loftiest ken of imagination.  The laws, by which this happiness or misery is regulated,  arc not an anomaly in the government of the Universe.  They, too, arc uniform in their operation.  Science falsely so called, puffed up by a fleshly-mind—a  vain and deceitful philosophy, arrogantly intruding into  thoso things of which it is profoundly ignorant—may imagine, that it has discovered the operatic.-i of those laws to be  wholly fortuitous and accidental. As well might the ignorant peasant argue from the ascent of smoke against the universality of the law of gravitation.  Man, then, as a religious being, nnd thus connected with  God and eternity, is subject to laws, through the uniform operation of which, he is constantly treasuring up for himself an  cruish that is intolerable, or happiness that no language can  eXpVcss-" an exceeding great and eternal weight of glory."  Here it is that our subject assumes an importance so vast, thai  it can bo'comprehended only by the Omniscient. He has  thoroughly scanned the whole grounds, and given his verdict Do you ask what it is? Go to Calvary, and read it  there Read, that you have not been " redeemed by corruptible things, as silver and gold-but by the precious blood of  Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.'

R I  t  ; i j  great water fall had been excavating for ages. On the third  of August, the volcano poured forth fresh torrents of lava,  which spread their devastating streams both far and wide.  The terror nnd desolation which marked this calamitous  event, may be partly imagined, when it is known that,  out of fifty thousand inhabitants that Iceland contained, nine  thousand human beings perished by this single eruption.  The lava emitted during this eruption of Skaptar Joltul,  flowed in streams of forty and filly miles long, and twenty in  breadth, the depth varying from one hundred to six hundred  feet, and covering an area of eighteen hundred square  miles.  The London Chronicle of April 3, contains the following  awful account of an eruption of Skaptai Jokul, or Jokal, by  Captain J. R. Bently of tho schooner Felerio, which we  copy from the Port Gibson Correspondent.  "We set sail from Bergen, on tho 12th of November, having exchanged our cargo, and repaired our vessel, with a favorable wind and an open sky, but when we had made about  fifteen leagues, we were struck by a violent slorm from th  westward, which lasted five days, and it demanded all our  exertions to avoid the rocky shores of Norway, Oa the  18th at sunset, the storm subsided and wo found ourselves in  latitude Go? 45', and long. 2° 59' E., about in a line between  the Laffodcn and Faros Isles. The wind then shifted N. E.  by N.j taking advantage of this, we held our course west  ward for seven days and nights, seldom changing a sail. On  Ihe 25th, about half past 1, P. M., Monsieur G. Polier, a  French gentleman of some scientific attainments, and passen  ger for London, directed my attention to singular appearances  iu the sky, which ho thought indicative of a squall. The  clouds which darkened the horizon along the N. N. West,  had a different appearance from any thing I had before witnessed, and while viewing them with some doubt, I observed  in the air, something having the appearance of fine soot,  which, in the course of an hour, began to fall upon the thick  of the vessel, and in a short time it settled in considerable  quantities in the folds of a sail, which was spread to catch it.  The circumstance excited the greatest apprehension among  our sailors, and all on hoard.  " No one can imagine the horrid grandeur of the scene, all  the elements seemed to have broken their boundaries, and  united their dreadful energies, in the production of one terrible disaster. While wo reflected that thousands of our fellow-  beings were overwhelmed with burning death, we could not  be indifferent to our own situation, and it was with feelings  of relief that we saw our vessel of a sudden laboring with a  gale that struck her from the westward with a force that  threatened to sweep our deck, as it bore us away from dangers so terrible, to struggle with those lo which we were more  accustomed. The gale pushed us before it with unprecedented velocity, at day break carrying away a sail, and doincr  much damage to our rigging. At sunrise it slocked, but we  continued to scud at a rapid rate till about 10 o'clock, when  wc were borne against lhc wind by a strong westward current. This circumstance filled us with alarm; for having  lost our points, we immediately concluded that we must be  within the draught of the Maelstroom.    These apprehen  sions, however, subsided, when we discovered that we hell  direct course. About 3 P. M., the wind shifted and blowintr  nearly astern, we made sixteen knots per hour. Al y A j\i  we had taken altitudes for discovering our location. What  was our surprise on finding our latitude 67° N., by lonm'ttide  29° 42' W., the precise latitude and longitude of Iceland I  The awful idea then flashed upon us, that the whole island  had sunk! A few more observations convinced us of the  truth of our apprehensions I The whole island, nearly equal  to England in size, with upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants, on that awful night in which our vessel lay before it  was sunk in the deep, and the last prayers of so many dis.  traded wretches, were hushed in the scalding waves that  closed over that ill-fated Island I Thus is a nation buried in  a single night, and the mariner has a highway over his  grave.  " Though frequently appealed to, I ventured no definite opinion, until about four o'clock, when, by reference to mv instruments, I found that we neared the coast of Iceland, and was  satisfied that the phenomenon was owing to a volcanic eruption. In about half an hour our attention was arrested by  columns of flame, which occasionally lighted the horizon,  and became every moment more terrific. At last ihe coast  appeared like a dark spot upon the horizon, frequently illumined by flashes of light. By this time the ashes had become so deep, that we were obliged to clear the deck with  hovels, and the shower every moment increasing. We held  our course till about eight o'clock in the evening, when of a  sudden the waters around us appeared in the greatest convulsion, the surges were broken to pieces, and the surface assumed the appearance of a boiling cauldron; the wind lulled and the sails hung by the mast, ns if wilted in the sun.  Thus we remained in awful suspense, not a word was spoken—all seemed lo realize that they gazed upon a scene to  which they were strangers. While in this state of anxiety,  of a sudden there burst forth a flame,acco;npanied by a noise  equal to the united voice of ten thousand thunders, which ■  reached to the very heavens, revealing the heaving sides ol  Skaptar Jokul! In a moment after, the mountain was liter-  lly rent to pieces ! Awful fissures from its summit lo its  base, permitted us to gaze into tho very bowels of the earth I  floods of lava poured down ils sides like molten iron; noise;  the most terrific startled tho earth, air, and sea! rocks of many tons weight shot into the sky and fell upon the vessel,  and all were in expectation of destruction; one poor negro  was literally dashed to pieces by a falling rock of five pounds  weight. The lava continued to pour from the craters till  tho country as far as the eye could reach was one boding  flood of molten stone!"  PORTRAITS OF THE FAMILY OF GEORGE III. OF  ENGLAND.  BY THE HON.

SOUTH-WESTERN JOURNAL.  239  ii r  possessed much of the firmness of purpose, which, being exhibited by men of contracted mind without any discrimination, and as pertinaciously when they arc in the right, lends  to their character nn appearance of inflexible consistency  which is often mistaken for greatness of mind, anel not seldom  received as a substitute for honesty. In all that related to  his kingly office, he was the slave of asdeep-iooted a selfishness as his son; and no feeling of a kindly nature ever was  suffered to cross his mind, whenever his power was concerned, either in ils maintenance or in tbe manner of exercising  it. In other respects he was a man of amiable disposition,  and few princes have been more exemplary in their domestic habits, or in the office of private friendship. But the ins-ant that his prerogative was concerned, or his bigotry inter-  fcred with, or bis will thwarted, ihe most unbending pride,  the most bitter animosity, the most calculating coldness of  heart, the most unforgiving resentment, took possession of his  whole breast and swayed it by turns. Tbe habits of friend  ship, the ties of blood, the dictates of conscience, the rules of  honesty were alike forgotten; and the fury of the tyrant,  with the resources of a cunning which mental alienation is  supposed to whet, were ready to circumvent or destroy all  who interposed an obstacle to ihe fierceness of his unbridled  desire. His conduct throughout the American war, and towards the Irish people, has often been cited as illustrative of  the dark side of his public character; and his treatment of  the Prince, whom ho hated with a hatred scarcely consistent  with the supposition of a sound mind, might seem to illustrate  the shadier part of his personal disposition; but it was in  truth only another part of his public, his professional conduct; for ho had no better reason for this implacable aversion than the jealousy which men have of their successors,  and the consciousness that the prince who must succeed him,  was unlike.him, and, being disliked by him, must, during  their joint lives, be thrown into the hands of ihe adversaries  he most of all detested."  Oueen Charlotte.—" Queen Charlotte was a woman  of the most ordinary size of understanding, of exceedingly  sordid propensities, of manners and disposition that rendered  her peculiarly unamiable, of a person so plain as at once to  defy all possible suspion of infidelity, and to enhance the virtue by increasing the difficulty of her husband's undeviating  constancy to her bed. Her virtue was so much accompanied  with superfluous starchness and prudery, that it set the feelings of respect and sympathy on edge; and though her regularity of life was undeviating, the dulncss of her society, the  stiffness of her demeanor, her narrowness of soul, tended to  make respectable conduct as little attractive as possible, and  rather to scare away from morality than to entice the beholder. Of a nature rigorously parsimonious, the slave besides,  of inordinate avarice, she redeemed not this hateful meanness  by any of those higher qualities of prudence and practical  sense, which are not unfrequently seen in its company. Her  spirit, too, obstinate, and not untinctured with spite; she was  unforgiving; she was not undesigning ; she could mingle in  the intrigues of a court, as well as feel its malignities; and  her pride knew no bounds—combining the speculative aristocracy of a petty German court, with the more practical  haughtiness which is peculiar to the patrician blood of this  free country. Of the Prince of Wales she never had been a  friend, until he became Regent, when she became at once bis  lool and his slave. On the contrary, on all occasions she had  partaken of her husband's hatred of him, and had been as  ready an accomplice of his maltreatment of her first-born  child, as she now made herself the submissive and willing  instrument of injury to his wife—his cousin and her own  niece. The visitation of God, which substituted that son for  his father on the throne, altered the whole face of affairs in  the eyes of this unamiable female, who seems to have been  raised up as a remarkable proof how little one maybe cither  respected or beloved, for being above reproach as regards the  quality sometimes supposed to comprise all female virtue, anil  which indeed is familiarly allowed to engross the name. To  gratify the Regent's paltry spite, she now refused even'to receive her daughter-in-law at that Court where she might any  day have become her successor; and the populace, moved  with just indignation at tho behaviour of this disagreeable  personage, loaded her with every offensive expression, and  even with more substantial symbols of an extravagant dis-  ust, while she was on her way to hold the court whence she  meanly submitted to excluele the Princess."  George, Prince of Wales, afterwards Georoe  IV., had been educated after the manner of all princes  whose school is the palace of their ancestors, whoso teacher  is boundless prosperity, whose earliest and most cherished  associate is unrestrained self-indulgence, and who neither  among their companions from the acquaintance ofanycquoM  nor in the discipline of the seminary, ever taste of control.  The regal system of tuition, is indeed, curiously suited to its  purpose of fashioning men's minds to the task of governing  their fellow creatures ; of training up a naturally erring and  sinful creature to occupy tho most arduous of all human stations, the one most requiring habits of self-command, and for  duly filling which all the instruction that man can receive,  and all the virtue his nature is capable of practising, would  form a very inadequate qualification. This system had upon  tho Prince of Wales, produced its natural effects in an unusually ample measure. He seemed indeed, to come forth from  the school, a finished specimen of its capabilities and its  powers, as if to show how much havoc can be made in character originally deficient in none of the good, and few ofthe  great qualities with which it may be supposed that men are  born.—Naturally of a temper by no means sour or revengeful, he had become selfish to a degree so extravagant, that he  seemed to act upon the practical conviction that all mankind  were born for his exclusive use ; and hence he became irritable on tbe least incident that thwarted his wishes, nay, secmeel  to consider himself injured, and thus entitled to gratify his resentment as often as any one, even from a due regard to his  own duty or his own character, acted in a way to disappoint  his expectations or ruffle his repose. His natural abilities  too, were far above mediocrity. He was quick, lively, gifted  with a retentive memory, and even with a ready wit,—endow ■  cd with an exquisite ear for music, and a justness of eye that  fitted him to attain a refined taste in the arts,—possessed, toe,  of a nice sense of tho ludicrous, which made his relish for  1: 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/602	602	603.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/603.jp2

The graces of his person and  his manners need not be noted, for neither are valuable, but  as the adjunct of higher qualities; and the latter, graceful  manners, arc hardly to bo avoided by one occupying all his  life that first station which removes constraint, and makes the  movement of the princes as naturally graceful as those ofthe  infant, or, the child too young to feel embarrassment.  "But of what avail arc all the natural endowments without cultivation ? They can yield no more fruit than a seed or  graft cast upon a marble floor; and cultivation which implies labor, discipline, self-control, submission to others, never  can be applied to the Royal state. They who believe ihat  they are exempt from the toils, and hardly liable to the casualties of other mortals, (all whose associates, and most of  whoso instructors, set about confirming this faith,) are little  likely to waste the midnight oil in any contemplations but  those ofthe debauchee; nnd those who can hardly bring  themselves to believe that they are subject to the common  fate of humanity arc pretty certain to own no inferior control.  ' Quoi done,' (exclaimed the young Dauphin to his right  reverend preceptor, win n some book mentioned a king as  having died)—■' Quoi done I les Rois meurenl its ?' 'Quel-  quefois, Monseigneur,' was the cautious and courtly reply.  That this prince should afterwards grow in the natural course  uf things, into Louis XIV., and that bis infant aptitude for  tho habits of royalty thus trained, should expand into the  maturity of self-indulgence which almost proved too grcat a  trial of French loyal patience, is not a matter of wonder.  Our Louis, notwithstanding the lessons of Dean Jackson and  the fellowship of Thurlow and Sheridan, was a man of very  uncultivated mind—ignorant of all but passages of history  which most princes read, with some superficial knowledge of  the dead languages which he had imperfectly learnt and  scantily retained, considerable musical skill, and great facility  of modern tongues, nnd no idea whatever of the rudiments of  any sciences, natural or moral; unless the very imperfect notions of the structure of governments, picked up in conversation or stupidity in newspapers, can be reckoned any exception to the universal blank.  "We have said nothing ofthe great quality of all—the  lest of character—firmness, and her sister truth, That the  Prince was a man of firm mind, not even his most unscrupulous flatterers ever could summon up the courage to pretend.  He. was much the creature of impulses, and the report of feeling naturally good and kind—but had become wholly selfish  through unlimited indulgence. Those who knew him well  wero wont to say that his was a woman's character, when  they observed how little self-command he had, and how easily he gave way to petty sentiments.—Nor was the remark  more gallant towards tho sex than it was respectful towards  the prince—inasmuch as the character of a woman transferred  to the other sex implies the want of those qualities which  constitute manly virtue, without the possession of the charms  by which female weaknesses are redeemed—independently of  ihe fact that those weaker parts are less prejudicial in lhc  woman because they are more in harmony with the whole.  That they who draw the breath of life in a court and pass all  their lives in an atmosphere of lies, should have any ver •  sacred regard for truth, is hardly to be expected. The",  experience such falsehood in all who surround them, that de  cepiion, at least suppression of the truth, almost seems necessary for self-defence—and accordingly, if their speech he not  framed upon the theory ofthe French cardinal, that language)  was given to man for the heller concealment of his thoughts  they at least seem to regard in what they say, not its resem-  blance to the fiict in question, but rather its subserviency to  the purpose in view.  " The course of private conduct which one in such a station—of such habits, and of such a disposition—might naturally bo expected to run, was that ofthe prince from his early  youth upwards—and when ho entered upon public life, be  was found to have exhausted the resource of a career of pleasure—to have gained followers without making friends Ic  have acquired much envy and some admiration among the  unthinking multitude of polished society; but not to command in any quarter, either respect or esteem."  We gladly give place in our Journal for the names of llic  officers, and for the introductory Lecture read before the Society for the Acquisition and Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,  of Columbus, Mississippi, June 9th, 1838.  Wc are glad to see our sister towns turning a portion ol  their attention to the subject of improvement in useful knowledge. We hail with pleasure the establishment of every  such society in Mississippi, and are ready to extend lo them  the right hand ol" fellowship; and the columns of our Journal are always open to such societies.

In submitting an opening lecture to the public exercises of  our association, the title by which we are known, has very  naturally suggested my subject. Our avowed object in this  association, is the acquisition and diffusion of knowledge.  You all know what this means. It were vain to follow the  schoolmen in their various readings and definitions of this  term. On this subject they have assuredly "darkened counsel by multitudes of words without knowledge." It is sufficient for our purpose to remark, that knowledge embraces  experience, or the acquirement of idea" or truths by observation, or the improvement of our faculties by reading and re-  fleclion, and learning.

The development  and exercise of these powers and faculties constitute knowledge.  In tho further illustration of this subject, we shall glance  al some of the impediments in the way to the acquisition of  knowledge, propose our plan for its natural and easy acquisition, and conclude with an exhibition of some of its advantages.  First, then, in the very threshold, the prejudices and lire-  conceptions of society around us, interpose a mountain barrier.    Mankind in all ages have received slowly and reluctantly, innovations or improvements upon long established  usages.    We are strongly wedded to tho ways in which our  fathers walked, and to the things our fathers loved.    As a  consequence, tho innovator most usually receives cursing,  instead of blessing, from tbe community he designs to benefit.    His motives are impugned, nnd his positions assailed  and condemned without examination.    The shafts of ridicule  and withering satire, dipped in the very dregs of Acheron,  arc hurled al him by every plodding drone ofthe community.  This, friends, is but the usual penance, which bold and fearless genius, talents and enterprise, must ever pay to ignorance  and stupidity.    Think it not strange, then, if even our unostentatious Association, for the acquisition and diffusion of useful knowledge, should encounter these difficulties.    No enterprise, nor improvement, however glorious or useful in its results to mankind, has shared a better fate.    All history is replete with evidences of this truth.    That portion of society  whose mushroom reputation or sordid interests are involved  in the perpetuity of established usages always raise the cuckoo note of speculation against every improvement.    When  Harvey gave his illustration of the beautiful mechanism of  the heart, arteries nnd veins, in the circulation of the blood,  the wise, doctors of the day pronounced it a pretty specula-  lion.    When Columbus proposed his theory of the earth,  and his plan  for the discovery of this western hemisphere,  lhc petty philosophersletttxed it an absurd speculation.  When  the immortal Fulton launched his first steamboat on the waters of tho Hudson, the gaping, scoffing multitude cried out,  what a foolish speculation.    When the bold and adventurous  bird of Jove mounts on untiring wing, to gaze on the sun in  his midday splendor, the gabbling goslings, lomtils, and dodoes, unable to follow him in his daring flight, cry out with  astonishment, what a splendid speculation !  The second impediment, we shall notice, to tho acquisition  of knowledge, is, ignorance of the specific faculties and powers to bo employed in this matter.  Much of the difficulty we encounter from this source, has  arisen from tho discussant and unsatisfactory systems of mental philosophy given us by tho metaphysicians. Scarcely  any two of them agree as to what are the primitive faculties  and capabilities of man. " System after system has flourish-  eel, fallen and been forgotten, in rapid and melancholy succession." By all of them, mind and its manifestations, have  been studied with too little reference to the body. They have  looked upon itasan indefinable something, separate mid apart  from organized matter.   With these discordant and unnatural  views of mind and its faculties, their cultivation could not of  course be otherwise than irregular, cmpyrical, and imperfect.  The third impediment to the acquisition of knowledge,  which wo would name, is tho improper direction of the faculties. We have all experienced the force of this difficulty.  The diudgcry, toil and disgust we have felt in conning over  by rote our school-boy lessons, can never be forgotten. We  can never forget thesovereign contempt and hatred with which  we looked upon our first preceptors, with their brandished  rods and menacing ferule. Now why was this? Have children actually no relish for, nor wish to acquire knowledge;  nor love for thoso who impart it? Most assuredly they have.  Their little hands, and eyes, and ears, and all their powers of  observation, arc constantly on lhc stretch for new discoveries  —for new objects in the world of wonders around them.  Every new idea acquired from acquaintance with these now  objects, their qualities, properties, and uses, brings with it inexpressible delight.  How, then, can it bo otherwise than irksome and disgusting  to call them off from this pleasing pursuit, and confine them,  under penally of the lash, to words, and names, and signs,  the meaning of which they do not as yet, and cannot comprehend. All they need, is the guidance of a kind heart, and  an intelligent head, who has studied nature and mind well  himself, lo repress the sallies of exuberant faculties, and to  ead out and quicken the sluggish in the paths which nature  takes. This done, and we shall love both the precept and  and the preceptor.  Wc might multiply a host of other impediments in tho or- A  dinary way of the acquisition of knowledge.    But let these  suffice; and we hasten to our plan for its ready, easy, and  pleasant acquisition.    This is all contained in the simple  maxim, follow nature.   If you wished to train a horse or any  other animal for a specific purpose, you would examine well  bis strength, his epialitics, and fitness for that purpose.   Then  know thyself—not as the fragment of a man; but as a beautiful, symmetrical whole—moral, intellectual and physical.  All these powers and faculties Clod has given you: and they  must all be cultivated; not by piecemeal, not disjointcdly,  but in harmonious concert.    The mind and the body mutually act and react one upon the other; the powers or faculties of  both must therefore bo cultivated, in order to give to each the  full play and compass of its energies.    Tho manner, or the  plan for the cultivation of these faculties, is simple, easy, and  natural.    Tho physical, intellectual nnd moral faculties of  man bear a certain and definite relationship to external nature.    This relationship must bo seen, and the laws which  govern it known, in order that you may cultivate each faculty, by addressing to it its appropriate related object.    For  example—If you wish to cultivate the physical powers of a  muscle, you must apply to it its related mechanical laws of  force, resistance, &c.    If you wish to cultivate the moral  faculty of benevolence, address it with its related object of  human misery and wretchedness.    If you would cultivate  the intellectual faculties—address to them their related objects of things and events.    This simple method of the education of lhc faculties, is termed the demonstrative—or edu-  VOL.

The advantages of knowledge, you all know, and can appreciate. Knowledge is power—yes, it is moro, 'tis health,  'tis riches, 'tis happiness. External nature presents lo the  mind of man, a vast assemblage of powers and influences,  beyond his feeble capabilities of resistance. Ocean's rolling  billows, the lightning's fiery course, the volcano's belching  throes, nnd tho tempest's fury, he cannot stay. But guided  and aided by the lights and powers of knowledge—" he can  lay his hand upon old ocean's mane, and play familiarly with  his hoary locks. He can, with the thunder, talk as friend  *o friend, nnd weave his garland of the lightning's wing, in  sportive twist the lightning's fiery wing."  Tho volcano's po\-ers drive his swift-winged car, and the  puffing steamboat: n.id the whitening sails of every sea, present iEo' is chained to his foaming keel. Then knowledge  is powe r. And, further, it is health. I have no hesitation in  affirming, that a generally diffused knowledge of tho laws  of health, ofthe nature and qualities of the influences around  us; and of their proper relationship to tho human constitution, would make diseases, 'ike angels' visits, few and far be-  Iwoen. You may think this is a strange declaration from  one who fattens on your calamities, and whose bread is the  price of ministering to those diseases. But it is not therefore the less true. The business of ihe philanthropic physician does not cease with the administration of tho bolus, the  pill and the emetic. He has»a higher duty to perforin, in contributing, from his knowledge of disease and ils causes to the  prevention of human suffering. But hero his efforts are all  paralyzed by the lamentable fatuity and ignorance that prevails on this subject. You study ihe structure of the houses,  castles, and temples of every clime.—You explore the bowels of the earth,—you trace the meanderings of every river,  and the lakes, gulfs, and seas of all countries. Yet, of the  house you live in, your own body, you know nothing. Its  covering, its frame work, its apartments, ils running streams  its reservoirs and fountains, its beautiful exhibition of the perfection of the natural organic laws, you have never studied.  This ought you to do, and not leave the other undone. This  is the point to begin at, lo enjoy the full tide of healthful vigor and activity, of which your physical powers are capable.  ( I hope some medical gentleman will pursue this subject.)  Again—Knowledge is wealth. Wealth does not consist  so much in the accumulation of a specific amount of properly, as in Iho number of sources or means wo have at command, of ministering to our comfort. These, sources, or  means of comfort and enjoyment, are opened in perpetual  fountains, by widely diffused practical knowledge,  Man, in a state of nature, is brought into being a helpless,  homeless wanderer; gathering a precarious subsistence from  the fruits of the forest; and sheltered from the rudo winds and  pitiless storm by his thatched wigwam. But let the lights of  knowledge dawn upon his benighted intellect, and he beholds  in tho earth upon which ho roams, a thousand capabilities ol  ministering to his wants.    Where before he discovered noth.  ing but barren, burning sands and rugged mountain cliffs ho  and diamonds, and iron, and all  n  now finds gold, and silver,  the variety of metals and precious stories, ready to be made  subsidiary to his every enjoyment. Gravitation enables him  to make the dashing, foaming cataract perforin the labor of a  pro-  thousand hands.    The winds waft him tho riches and  ducts of every land.    In fine, all the natural and physical  laws, unfolded to him by knowledge, are rendered subservient  and willing caterers to his case and wealth.  Further, and in conclusion—knowledge is happiness. In  illustrating this branch of our subject, it is necessary that our  notions of happiness should be enlarged and rigidly defined,  What, then, is human happiness, or in what does it consist?  Endless speculations and differences of opinion ever have,  and elo yet exist on ibis subject. One individual tells you it  is only to bo found in a savage state of nature ; and novelists,  poets, and even philosophers have dwelt in songs of sweetest  melody on the "paucity of its wants, the simplicity of its pursuits, and the solidity of its pleasures." It is here, wc are  told, unsophisticated nature revels in all the luxury of prime-  ,-al innocence. Unlearned in crime, undebauched by effem-  nucy, unpractised in the duplicity, treachery, and cunning of  civilized life, the spirits, free as their own mountain breeze,  pialf delights, constant, and without alloy. The sensualist  tells you it can only be found in sparkling bowls, in sumptuous racy viands, and in tho revels of the seraglio. The  miser points to his heaps of shining gold, and says, behold!  there is happiness. The poet and the philosopher tell you it  can only be found amid Parnassian flowers and Acadcmus  shades—that fancy, reason and judgment are every thing—  that health or sickness, riches or poverty, pain or pleasure,  do not even enter into the account of human happiness. Another assures you it is all summed up in these three words  —wife, children, and friends. And still another, that  it consists only in the observance of moral tlulies. Now,  these positions are all wrong; and the errors consist in the  disjointed, one-sided and superficial views taken of human  nature.—One has looked at man only as animal, another as  social, another as an intellectual, anel another as a moral being.—They have seen these faculties of his nature in lively  and pleasant exorcise—they havo indulged in the pleasures  of sense, they have, mingled amid tho sweets of social intercourse; they have drank at ihe Pyercan Spring, and they  have experienced the calm peace and joy arising from a conscientious discharge of moral duty. But they have looked  at these sources of happiness, one at a time—as isolated,  apart, ono from the other, and incapable of being enjoyed all  together. The perfection of human happiness consists in lhc  accordant exercise of all the powers, physical, intellectual,  and moral. This constitutes the highest point of human perfection on earth ; and as man is a progressive being, the continued and illimitable development of those powers, purified  and spiritualized, will, no doubt, constitute his never-failing  happiness in the abodes of the blessed.  In tho constitution of our faculties, God has designed our  moral nature for the study of Himself, our intellectual for the  study of His works, and our animal for the preservation and 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/605	605	606.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/606.jp2

It is the link  that connects with Angels and Jehovah himself—and in caz  ing upon tho King of Kings, we shall be changed into the  same image, from glory to glory. Guided by animal im  pulses alone, we are no better than the beasts that perish,  Intellect, with the full stretch of all its gigantic powers un  controlled by moral principle, is at best but a blind Cyclops  —a Polyphemus with his thunderbolts and a demon's heart  to guide them.  Animalism—mere brute propensity, we nre sorrow to say-  it, is in tho ascendancy among us. Its results you all see in  the vice and crime prevalent in our land. And vice is a  contagion of the most terrible virulence—more contagious  and fatal than plague or cholera. Our old men have died of  it, our young men, many of them have also caught tho disease, and they ton will die, yes, die eternally, if they are not  cured. Our children are now exposed to tho same contagion.  What parent, what philanthropist, then, can sit still or be  idle, amidst this moral desolation. Ho deserves not the name,  nor the habitation of a man who would not bo up and doing.  The mountain defile, the tiger's lair, or the den of the hooting owl, would better suit the moral and intellectual sluggard,  than the abode's of man. Tho march of mind, the march of  morals is onward, but as long as wc arc exposed to the contagion of moral pestilence, it becomes us to be vigilant. Let  us throw a strong cordon all around us.

No trains of thought are more interesting than those  which lead the mind back to the patriarchal ages. It is delightful to catch tho vistas that open here and there occasion  ally through tho shadowy courses of history—to behold the  fathers of mankind seated beneath tho spreading tree, or inhal  ing at ihe doors of their tents the spicy breezes of the morn  ing—attended by their families—dispensing the lessons of  wisdom which they learned from tradition, or collected from  their own experience. One always associates with such  scenes a halcyon tranquility that knew no interruption from  day today—the pure fountains from which the maidens drew  supplies of the clement so essential to all domestic purposes—  die boundless pasturages in which herds and flocks roved at  will—the fruitage anel fragrance of Arabia—tho milk and  honey of Canaan—the cedars of Lebanon—tho palms bordering the Jordan—tho comprehensive affections of an Abraham, and the beauty of a Rebecca.  Glancing from these woodland and pastoral scenes to the  nations oven then employed in the production of objects that  indicate progress in all the arts of civilized life—their agri-  'Allusions to our Cily Sociclieg,  culture carried to a high degree of perfection—their commerce conducted over distant seas—their wars waged by vast  armies—their weapons, chariots, armour, helmets, shields.anel  costume manufactured with a degree of skill, and embellished  with a multitude of ornaments, not excelled in elegance even  at tho present day—we lapse into reveries from which it is  painful to be disturbed by the calculations of chronology.  India—China—Egypt—what store-houses of the ancieni  days I In which did Civilization commence her career ?  Where did the spider first teach man to spin the thread, and  to weave the net ? The fall of the Tower of Babel, did it  give rise to the Pyramids ? What " desolate cities " were  those—where were those " desert houses reduced into heaps,"  of which Job speaks ? Who were the accumulators of the  " treasures hidden" in the earth long before his time, to  which he alludes? "Desolate cities"—"ruined—deserted  houses," " treasures hidden " in places no longer remembered—at an epoch full fifteen hundred years at least before the  commencement of the Christian era ?  How many ages did it require to produce the population  that built and decorated the cities which had then become  lesolate? Whence did they derive exuerience in the cultivation of thoso arts of manufacture by which only large  cities can be supported ? Even now the notion of treasure  being buried in the earth by opulent people who flourished  in ancient times is so prevalent in tho East, that travellers arc  constantly suspected by the natives as having no other object  for their researches than the discovery and appropriation of  such deposits. Only imagine riches that had rusted in their  unknown sepulchres long before Job took- counsel of the  Themanite! Ho moreover speaks familiarly of a state of  commerce in which gold and silver were exchanged for dyed  cloths, conveyed to his country from India, and for precious  stones from Ethiopia. Luxuries such as these prove a condition of society then existing in Ethiopia, Syria, and India,  which must have attained a high degree ol refinement. Bin  a similar degree of civilization must have been known lo the  cities that had then the ivy mantling their ruined houses—the  wind murmuring through their desolate, streets !  These are not dreams ! Tho traces of towns and temples  engulfed in the earth and sea by tho earthquakes and the  inundations which havo visited India at periods lost to tho  memory of man; the numberless ruins to bo found in all parts  of Syria, of cities of which history nnd tradition are silent,  and whose very names have perished; the mighty devastations on tho banks of tho Nile, bear ample testimony to the  facts alluded to by the simple and.upright mourner of the  land of Hits. When, in consequence of a famine, Abraham  quitted his own country and went down to Egypt, it appears  lo have been even nt thnt period—eighteen hundred years and  moro before tho beginning of our era—the granary of nations.  From the scriptural narrative it is manifest that his son Joseph  found the Egyptians fnr advanced in many of the arts that  embellish a refined state of society. Pharoah presented Joseph  with a " ring from his own hand," a " robe of silk," a neck  chain of gold," and a chariot. Egypt appears to havo been  at that time universally cultivated. Money was already in  use, for Joseph's brothers are said to have taken considerable 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/606	606	607.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/607.jp2

The  process of embalming was practised ; and when Joseph attended the funeral of his father, he had in his train " a great  company of chariots and horsemen." His wife was the  daughter of a priest of the celebrated temple of Heliopolis,  one of lhc obelisks of which exhibits the remarkable skill  that must have been attained even before that remote age by  Egyptian artisls in sculpturing granito—an operation even  now found to be attended with extreme difficulty.  Some of the expressions used by Joseph, when he accused  his brothers of being spies, appointed to observe the "weaker  parts of the land," as well as the memorials of Beni Hassan  and Thebes, distinctly prove that the Egyptians had already  carried their arms into Asia, and had there encountered foes  of a formidable description. Amongst these were the Shaire-  lan ; probably, if wc judge from the name, the ancestors of  the Saracens. They appear to have inhabited the Asiatic,  coast, near Egypt. It is a popular supposition that crests and  coats of mail date from the Crusades. The Shairctana wore  crested helmets, cuirasses, and coats of mail, composed of  broad metal plates which overlaid each other, wero adapted to  the form of the body, and secured at tho waist by a girdle.  That people wero distinguished by their light hair and complexion, as well as by the aquiline nose, from tho Egyptians.  They wore large ear-rings, and employed many ships,so that  they must have been a commercial, as well as a warlike and  enterprising nation. Their appearance, as presented by the  Egyptian artists, is that of a highly civilized community.  The same artists have preserved the features of severa  other nations, whose names havo been lost in tho stream of  time, and who, according to the representations given of them  had attained a degree) of refinement unknown to the Egyptians, A people called the Rebo were frequently engaged in  hostilities with thedrinkers ofthe Nile. They brought into the  field immense masses of troops, and were pre-eminently skilled  in the art of war; they lived in Asia, at a considerable distance  from Egypt; their climate was temperate—their complexion  almost European ; their dicss was an under garment, a short  kilt, a long outer robe highly colored, richly bordered, and  ornamented with fanciful devices. Beneath the outer robe  they wore a girdle splendidly ornamented,the extremity falling down in front and terminating in a large tassel. They  decorated their persons with ear-rings, necklaces, and various  trinkets. The chiefs decked their heads, in the Mexican and  Peruvian style, with feathers, and painted or tattooed their  arms and legs. They were distinguished from the African  races by the aquiline nose, blue eyes, and small red beards.  The fact of such a nation as this exhibiting all the signs of  organized power, moving vast armies from a temperate, and  therefore a distant Asiatic country, and frequently resisting  with success the forces brought against them by the Egyptians, must tend to open new views about the early history of  the world.  Another remarkable nation recorded in the Egyptian paintings, are the Shari, Among the ornaments worn by these  people were necklaces, lo which a small crucifix was suspended,    The Rebo also frequently wore a cross in ihe same  manner, or figured upon their robes, full fifteen hundred  years before that emblem became snered as tho token of o  ideinption.    About ihe same period, a people, supposed to  be Lyeiians, drove a battle in four-wheeled chariots and curri  cles, and appear to have been possessed of rare woods  ohl and silv  ivory,  mil silver vases of tho most exquisite form and workmanship, rings of tho same metals, porcelain jars filled with  choice gums and resins for making incense (which they probably obtained from Arabia).  Our modern modes vary so frequently that I really do not  know whether at this moment wide sleeves or narrow sleeves  flounces or no flounces, long gloves or short, are the fashion  I find, however, that at the period just mentioned the Lydian  ladies were accustomed to wear long gloves, flowing erar.  ments, secured at tho waist by a girdle, and trimmed with  three rows of flounces; that their sleeves were sometimes  large and open, sometimes fastened tight round tho wrist, and  that some of them wore caps to which a long tassel was appended ; while others, tho maidens I presume, tied a band  round the head, and permitted the hair to fall at each side in  graceful ringlets. Only imagine the triple flounce, the balloon sleeve, and tho fcronierc to have been in vogue three  thousand three hundred years ago !  The new Egyptian saloon recently opened at the British  Museum is at once tho most interesting nnd perhaps the most  perplexing room in Europe. Wo have here, a collection of  objects, many of them found in tombs in which they must  have been deposited even before the remote period just referred to, and exhibiting unequivocal tokens of civilization  advanced to a stage that must surprise the schools. We have  here small figures of Egyptian deities, of quadrupeds and birds  beautifully wrought in bronze, stone, and porcelain; chairs,  some plain like those used in our kitchens, some inlaid and  highly embellished; three-legged stools wilh concave seals,  much moro agreeable than our horizontal ones; a model  of a house, and a great variety of vases in glass, bronze,  earthenware, and alabaster, and in a semi-transparent kind of  composition resembling our Derbyshire ornaments; leather  sandals and shoes; metallic mirrors: wooden combs for  combing the hair exactly like those which we use; hair pins  of wood and ivory ; bowls, cups, and spoons , a pair of roast  ducks found in a Theban tomb; a rope ladder, by which probably a Don Giovanni of those days ascended the balcony of  his mistress; implements for writing and painting; several  glass phials; and a complete set of carpenter's tools, the saw,  the mallet, the chisel, the axe, the drill, nails, together with  the basket in which they were found by Mr. Burton, all resembling thoso now used by artisans of that trade. Fan-  handles, small boudoir boxes of ivory, children's dolls, musical instruments, rings for the ears and fingers in gold, ivory,  and various metals ; necklaces of gold, of beads in glass and  other substances, are also to be seen in this mysterious chamber, which moreover, abounds in mummies of bards and priests,  and in coffins so exquisitely painted that they beguile death  itself of its horrors. A great majority of these articles must  have been wrought almost four thousand years ago; aim  when we pass from them to the statues, sarcophagi and fragments of sculptures and paintings brought from Egypt by out 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/607	607	608.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/608.jp2

Tho fragments of sculptures anil paintings lately presented  the British Museum by several enterprising travellers, wdio  aiipcar to have made Egypt their particular study, have greatly extended our acquaintance with that country. The researches of M. Champollion and Professor Roselini, but  especially those of Mr. Wilkinson, have thrown a flood of  light upon tho sculptures and paintings of Beni Hussai  (grottoes on the eastern bank of the Nile, near the Speos  Artemidos,) and Thebes. In his recent work on the "Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," the latter gentleman has introduced a great number of lithographic copies  nf those valuable memorials. Ilo has accompanied them by  descriptions and details of the most interesting character, A  few visits lo the Museum, and a perusal of Mr. Wilkinson's  splendid volumes—for splendid they are in every sense of the  word—will fill any mind, previously uninformed upon this  subject, with astonishment. Mr. Wilkinson's dates appear  not to have been given, without tho most ample consideration  of all the authorities and monuments which afford any clue  to that intricate question.  From all these sources wc find that eighteen hundred years  ii. c. a slate of civilization existed, in which men wero cm-  ployed very much as they are at present. The rich had their  villas, to which were attached gardens and parterres, and enclosed parks for deer, vineyards, and orchards. During their  excursions in pursuit of wild animals they had huntsmen to  assist them, who conducted tho dogs to the field, managed  them in the chase, and secured and brought home the game.  The grandees had also their private boats and their establishments of watermen. There were in those days, just as now,  shop-keepers,  musicians, builders, masons, public weighers,  notaries, carvers and gilders, curriers, cabinet-makers, cooks  ami, in short, almost every description of artisan, with the exception of thoso lately created amongst us by the introduction  of gas-light and steam  Some few years ago, when public companies wero got up  in London for every possible purpose, serving the town with  unadulterated milk, bringing sea-water for baths to every  house, washing linen without tearing it, baking bread without  poison, and shaving beards without the application either of  soap or razor, an association astonished the good citizens by  issuing proposals for hatching eggs without the assistance of  hens. If any modern device seemed entitled to the honor ol  being considered novel, one would think that this might have  been set down nt the head of the catalogue of new inventions.  The whole process was known to tho ancient Egyptians, and  even at tho present day tho markets of Alexandria unci Cairo  are supplied with poultry warmed into life by artificial means.  The eggs are placed in ovens heated to the requisite temperature, and carefully tended until tho desired result is produced.    The operation requires about twenty-one days.  When lately going over tho baths of Titus, at Rome, I remember the long pause 1 made before the beautiful arabesques  with which those remains of imperial luxury are ornamented.  The paintings are much faded, but they are so replete with  the graces of refined laste, that to gaze upon them is to hear  the whispers of some divine music. The guide tells everybody that the similar decorations spread over the ceilings of  the stairs and galleries of the Vatican, painted poetry in truth  worthy of that paradise of tho arts, and which even seems to  impart new lustre to the countless memorials of Greek and  Roman genius preserved in those glorious chambers, were  stolen by Raphael from the frescoes of the baths in question.  Until those frescoes were brought more in'.o light by the removal of the rubbish with which they were incumbered, the.  artist had the credit of being the inventor of that species of  ornament. The merit of the application and of the matchless execution is all his own. But even if the baths of Titus  had not been cleared out, the houses of Pompeii, several of  which I have seen similarly adorned, would have disturbed  his claims as the inventor of the most beautiful architectural  embellishments with which art has yet captivated the human  eye-  Judge then, of my surprise when, on opening the second  volume of Mr. Wilkinson's work, I beheld a whole page of  the same species of decoration, copied and colored from a  tomb at E' Sioot, where they must have been painted at least  sixteen hundred years before the Christian era! Tho favorite forms appear to be the lotus, the square, the circle, the  diamond, and tho succession of scrolls and square within  square, usually styled the Tuscan border I It appears further  that, from the most remote times, the ceilings and walls of  Egyptian houses were similarly painted in compartments,  with borders of an appropriate description.  Connoisseurs have been hitherto puzzled to find out tho   a  original inventors of the scarab and the harpy, and those  other beautiful emblems which abound on the Greek and  Etrurian vases.    Tho very epithet seems to have settled the  question that the Etrurians were the designers of those won-_  derful creations, in which all that is elegant in thought and  bewitching in imagination seems to bo combined with a felicity and a variety truly to be envied.  They were all familial  to Egyptian genius three thousand five hundred years ago r  I  know of few enjoyments more  delightful  than those  which I experienced, when, the sun shining intensely in tlfT  heavens,  I  have  lounged through the narrow streets -j  Seville, the lofty houses shading me from the gh  in  and the fountains, and evergreens, and fresh flowers ol  Palios soothing at once the ear and the eye.

The entrance to it from tho street is through an iron gate of moderate  size, the bars sometimes plainly intersecting each other, some •  times fancifully intcrtwining.butso as to allow the square within to bo visible to the passenger.

To them we  owe whatever is allied to poetry in the construction and decoration of private and public edifices in Spain, with tho exception of the Gothic cathedrals. The watch-tower rising above  ihe mansion—the castellated wall—the Patio—the inexhaustible combinations of fancy displayed in the arabesques which  they have left behind them in the sculptured arches of their  ,'ates and doors—their very objection to live upon ground  floors, which were either wholly unoccupied or used as store,  rooms for lumber of every kind—all bespeak a highly civilized people—people of a much more elevated tone of genius  ihan tho Spaniards, who expelled them from the land they  had almost made their own.  The Moors I The next inquiry was, whence did they  come ? From Africa. Who taught them those arts in which  they excelled? That was a question I could not answer to  nir own satisfaction, until I beheld in the painting of Thebes  and Alabastron, as copied by Wilkinson, houses and villas constructed in precisely the same style, wilh tho Patio, the fountain, flowers, tho awning, the towers, the castellated walls, the  arabesques—every thing, in short, for which I had given credit  lo Moorish taste—and all carried to perfection in that mysterious Egypt three thousand years before the Moors were  driven out of the Peninsula!  Tho observers of thoso systems of manoeuvring which pre  vail, especially in the higher circles, and which have some-  limes politics for their object, bul more generally the formation of desirable connexions by marriage, have ascribed to  modern ingenuity tho establishment of thoso female archery  societies, got up for the purpose of displaying the figures of  beautiful debutantes in their most graceful attitudes before  their wished for admirers. It is pleasant, at all times, to bo  able to do justice to thoso who have been the object of much  altimny. Tho Theban paint.' igs display ladies of rank  amusing themselves precisely in a similar manner, with this  difference only, that they held the bow in the right hand and  drew tho string with tho left. It was in this manner also,  hat the ancient British archers used that weapon, so formidable in llieir contest with foreign and domestic foes.  Let it be borne in mind that we arc still speaking of a period  not later than fifteen hundred yea,s before the Christian era,  ind under this impression let us view, if wc can, without as-  tonishment, tho signs of advanced civilization which wc behold throughout thoso wonderful memorials, the Theban  sculptures. Ladies, elegantly attired, are seen seated on  ■ hairs, and on fautcuils of ebony und other rare woods, inlaid with ivory, nnd sometimes covered with rich brocades,  with leathern cushions, and all the devices of modern luxury.  They had, moreover, that most delectable of all provocatives  t( repose, tho kangaroo chair, which ninety-nine persons out  of a hundred would pronounce to bo quite a modern invention. The legs arc formed frequently in imitation of those  &lt;if tho lion or the goat; the backs arc high and concave; and  in some of the larger fautcuils tho arms are remarkably  lold and graceful, consisting of the figur of the lion, or  some other wild animal.    Tho easy chairs have handsome  pillows of colored cotton, painted leather, or gold and silver  lisstic. Their footstools scarcely differed in form or elegance  from those seen in our best furnished drawing-rooms: their ottomans' were remarkably splendid, the cushions being covered with leather or cotton cloth, richly colored, nnd the biso  being formed of wood, ornamented with the figures of cae-  tives. Their couches or sofas were in every respect a-  clegant as their ottomans, and similar to those now in use in  civilized countries. They had wooden rests for the head of  which many specimens may be seen at the Museum. Sonm  of their tables appear to have been remarkably beautiful,especially their round tables of metal or stone, sustained by the  figure of a slave. Our upholsterers would do well to study  these specimens of antirme furniture, from which they mWii  derive many suggestions for improvements that would appear  to tho multitude of purchasers altogether novel!  Ono of the most decided tests by which the progress of a  community in civilization maybe proved, is their mode of treating the female members of their families. It is amongst barbarians only, or tribes little advanced beyond the savage state,  that we find mothers and daughters universally secluded from  the ordinary walks of life, and compelled to perform offices  of a menial description. In the most ancient ages of Egypt,  of which tho sculptures and paintings of Beni Hassan or  Thebes afford any memorial, we find the ladies, in the better  ranks of life, bearing tho same relation of equality to the  lords of the creation as they do at this moment in France or  England. They sometimes sit together on the same couches  and chairs; generally, indeed, in the same room, the ladies  herd together, as is very much the case in South America.  But this circumstance argues no difference in point of station.  They havo their attenelant slaves, nnd all the tokens of respect  and luxury around them. Some of the Theban frescoes  have preserved their memorials also, which arc often found  to bo tho accompaniments of a matured state of society, namely, an addiction to excitement by the produce of the grape.  We have representations, not only of gentlemen taken home  by their servants in a state of the most helpless intoxication,  but also of secret festivities among women of rank, during  which the slaves are as busy in supplying the basin as the  stewardess of a steamer when there is a swell in tho sea.  Tho fading flower, depending from the feverish hand, tells a  sad talc of indulgence not very consistent with a patriarchal  stage of society. It should bo remarked, however, that ancient Egypt was distinguished for its delicious wines, as well  as for its beer, which was of an excellent quality—temptations not to be resisted.  In Mr. Fenimoro Cooper's delineation of London life, a*  he has been pleased to designate his slight acquaintance with  a few peers and gentlemen, ho has given some elaborate criticisms upon the various intonations ofthe raps inflictcdupon  the knocker of his door by tho footmen of his visitors.   So  lfuldid he become during his brief experience in the notes  appropriated to every order, that he deemed himself qualified  lo judge at once, upon hearing Ihe peal of sounds, whether his  aller was a duke, a marquis, an carl, a baron, a commoner,  or a dun. No doubt the American conceived that, in describing these matters for the benefit of his countrymen, he was 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/609	609	610.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/610.jp2

I forget whether it is to the same author  we are indebted for some smart remarks upon those affected  diners out, who make it a point never to arrive until the soup  is about to quit tho table.  If Mr. Cooper, nnd the said satirist, whoever he may be',  would take the trouble to look at Mr. Wilkinson's copy of a  Theban fresco, No. 176, they would there find that both the  evils of which they complain were known to society thirty or  Drty centuries ago. The English late comer justifies his  tardiness, by pleading the extreme torture to which a sedentary  company is exposed during the awful half-hour thai precedes  ihe announcement of dinner.  [n this respect we might take a hint from the Egyptians  they had generally musicians to entertain them beforeas well  as alter dinner; and, like the Russians nnd Germans, they also  had their cordials, which were handed round in the drawing-  room before they applied the appetite to the more substantial  luxuries of tho saloon set apart for banquets. Will it be be-  lived that they often dined on roast beef and goose—that they  had their puddings and pies—that they drank their wine out  of glasses, and that they even challenged each other, and  drank healths as wo do in this nineteenth century?  There is scarcely any musical instrument familiar to us  which the Egyptians did not possess from the earliest times  —the harp, in a wonderful variety of forms—the lyre, played with and without the plectrum—the 'uitar (the Spanish  guitar!)—the tambourine—the single and double flageolet—  the trumpet, the cymbals, the drum, and the sistrum. There  is a passage in Plato, referring to Egyptian music, which is I  in his day; for if accumulating evidence had not since enti-  tied him to bo ranked among the most intelligent nnd accurate  of travellers, people, oven now, might bo astonished at his  talking of the restoration of arts, at a period when many  can scarcely believe that they were in their infancy.  Instead of laughing with George Selwyn, wc should now  laugh at him for his caustic insinuation against Bruce's voracity. Some one asked the traveller, in a large company, at  dinner, "What musical instruments aie used in Abyssinia?"  Bruce answered, "1 think I saw one lyre there." George  whispered into the ear of the person sitting near him, " Yes;  and there is one less since he left the country." It appears,  in fact, from a description given by Alhenams, that upwards  of six hundred musicians were employed in the chorus,  amongst whom there were three hundred performers on tin:  cithara, in the Bacchic festival of Ptolemy Philadelphia.  Tho castanets, like the guitar, arc supposed very generally  to bo of Spanish, or at least of Moorish origin. There is no  doubt ihat they are Egyptian, the only difference being thai  in Spain they are made of the wood of the chestnut, (caslina,)  whereas in ancient Egypt, thoso small cymbals, played with  the finger and thumb, wero composed of metal.  Nothing can bo more commonplace than the remonstrances  made by some of our prudes against what they are pleased  to call the modern grossness of opera dancers—their standing on one foot, tho other being elevated and extended parol.  to tho arm, while the figure of the fair artiste spins about  like a top—their short flights in the air—and, in short, all  thoso rapid variations of attitude by which tho Melanies and  Mcrcaudottis extracted so much applause and hard cash from  John Bull,  Taglioni is  levying large contributions on the  aarkable on account of the high antiquity which he Russians, and Duveriiay intends lo obtain a revenue more  very rer  ascribes lo Egyptian civilization. " The plan," he says,  " which we have been laying down for the education of youth,  was long known to the Egyptians, that nothing but beautiful  forms and fine music should be permitted to enter into ihe assemblies of young people. Having settled what those forms  and what that music should be, they exhibited them in their  temples ; nor was it allowable for painters, or other imitative  artists, to innovate or invent any forms different from what  were established; nor lawful, either in painting, statuary, or  any branches of music, to make any alteration. Upon examination, therefore, you will find that the pictures and statues  made ten thousand years ago, arc in no one particular better  or worse than what they now make."—Plato, 2d Book of  Laws.  A remark in Bruce runs in a similar vein. Speaking of  the harps of a tomb at Thebes, he says, that " they overturn  all the accounts hitherto given of the earliest state of music  and musical instruments in the East, and are altogether, in  their form, ornaments, and compass, an incontcstible proof,  stronger than a thousand Greek quotations, that geometry,  drawing, mechanics and music, were at the greatest perfection when this instrument was made, and that the period from  which we date the invention of these arts, was only the beginning of the era of their restoration." The harps in rpics-  tion were of the time of Remeses III., about 1235 years before Christ.    No wonder that Bruce was so much lampooned  than equal to that of many a German principality. "Such  distortions of the human frame were never seen before! All  tho result of the vicious state of sociely at which we are arrived! shameful abominations—they should be confined to  the French academy, whcic, no doubt, they have been invented !    And then the petticoat!"  Remembering these sage criticisms, I confess I could not  help laughing outright when I beheld, in a copy of the Beni  Hassan memorials, a group of female dancers, one pirouetting away on one foot, the other extended precisely in the  Academic style, and the arms outstretched. I thought at first  it was Taglioni herself! There are eight dancers in all,  some attitudinizing, the arms raised above the bead and the  hands gracefully meeting; some dancing in pairs; some,  evidently figurantes, waiting until the principal artisleshave  finished their exhibitions. And then the petticoat—I am  sorry to say it—is not an inch longer than Taglioni's.  It is, however, but justice to those primeval days (I speak  f three thousand five hundred years ago) to remark, that  though the dresses of the female dancers were sufficiently  fine to show tho form and movement of the limbs, they generally reached the ankles. Round the hip was a small narrow girdle, adorned with beads or ornaments of various colors. In most of the respectable families, the slaves were  taught dancing and music; but it appears that free Egyptians, who derived their subsistence from the display of their 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/610	610	611.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/611.jp2

Sometimes a man danced a solo lo  sounds made by the clapping of hands.  The minuet dc la cour is claimed also as a French invention. But wo have it on a Theban fresco ! It would appear,  moreover, that the hornpipe, which affords so much delight  to the galleries in the " Beggar's Opera," was not unknown  upon the Nile at the period in question: and that the Highland reel, the Irish jig, the Spanish bolero, the quadrille, and,  mirabile dicta! even the galopode, are all neither more nor  less than imitations oft ho performances familiar to the Egyptians long before the Trojan war.  Nay, Joe Giimaldi or at least some kinsman of his, as well  as his friends, Pantaloon and Harlequin, flourished in that  hoary ago; and there is absolutely in one of these monuments  u perfect prototype of Jim Crow. That popular monster I  certainly did hitherto deem an original. But when I find  that ho has only been copying from an Egyptian fresco (No.  241) nearly four thousand years old, I am compelled to exclaim,  with Solomon, There really is, " nothing now under the sun !

For as Cicero has well observed all those charities, all those affections of good-will  which wo bear to relatives, friends and benefactors arc included in it, Patriotism strengthens and purifiesthe affections-  elevates and enlarges the soul, and opens it to tho contemplation of those objects of benevolence nnd charity which  claim the attention of tho merciful, and challenge the approbation of the good. It implies a reverence, for the institutions  of our country, and a respectful submission to her laws. It  implies more: it implies a zeal in defending nnd supporting  those institutions nnd laws by all laudable efforts. The true  patriot will use every honorable means in his power to advance the interest and prosperity of his country. He will  discountenance vice and immorality, in whatever form they  may present themselves, and encourage morality and virtue,  both by precept and example. He will be ever ready lo offer  himself as a sacrifice upon tho altar of his country, and to  pour out his blood in defence of her liberties; and in the hour  of moral darkness and political degeneracy, when the black  clouds are gathering over his head, he will be the first to bare  his brow.  Who cannot look back and contemplate with pleasure and  delight the characters of those who have devoted their time,  their talents and their lives for the honor and prosperity of  their country, the good of their fellow-men, and for the advancement of religion nnd truth. Such is the character of  those who have shone with such transcendant brilliancy upon  the historian's page, and whose names live in the example of  tcose who have been esteemed the wise and good of every  succccding age, and will continue to live ns long as virtue  and truth shall find nn asylum in the human heart. With  what feelings of exultation and of wonder do we contemplate  tho tomb of Lconidas nnd his three hundred Spartan companions, who fell on tho plains of Thermopylae, with this inscription, " Traveller, go tell to Laccdemon, that we die here in  obedience to her sacred laws"!

SOUTH W E S T E K N   J 0 U RN A 1,  210  1  heave in surveying the last moments of Epaminondas, the  lisliious Theban General, who, in the battle of Mantinia was  wounded, and while the javelin was still remaining in his  breast, enquired the fate of his country, and being told that  all was well, exclaimed,  "I have lived long enough,"    But  wc need not go back to ancient Greece and Rome for examples  of truo patriotism.    In our own history and in our limes, we  have tho examples of such men as a Wolfe, who, when mortally wounded on the field of battle, and learning that the en  ciny fled, exclaimed, "I die happy," and of a Washington  who sacrificed his own ease and comfort for tho good of his  country.    These arc sublime spectacles of patriotism, and  worthy tho admiration and imitation of all who would be  styled the. lovers of their country, and the benefactors of mankind.    Such feelings should animate the breasts of every one  who has such an inheritance left him as our fathers left to us  —free, republican institutions—and to preserve and defend  these, tho patriot must show his own right arm.    No govern  meiit under heaven, especially a democracy, can long exist  imcorrupted, unless the people have a love to their country  and a regard to her institutions, superior to all private and  personal considerations.    They must let the glow of patriotism kindle lo a flame, and burn and blaze upon their very  countenances, with undying  lustre.    The soul, filled with  true patriotism, feels a fire burning within, which the bloody  waters of despotism will never be able to quench, nor the  sword of the tyrant to subdue.    This was the patriotism that  binned in tho bosoms ofthe patriots ofthe revolution.    Yes,  they loved their country indeed.    In that little band, the descendants of an oppressed and despised ancestry, driven by  intolerance and persecution from their homes and their native soil, to seek an asylum in tho forests of a newly discovered world, we behold the consummation and concentration of  all  human virtues—all that is great in intellect, lofty in  thought, elevated in sentiment, generous in purpose, or decisive in action.    Their love of truth and justice was ever unwavering; their regard for religion and morality unfaltering;  and their sincerity, candor, magnanimity, gentleness, and forgiveness of injuries without a parallel.    Reared and educated in the severe school of adversity, there wero no difficulties  they could not surmount, no privations they could not submit  to, no hardships they could not endure, nor any sacrifice they  wero not ready to make.    Their lives, their fortunes, their  honor, and all they held near and dear, were devoted to their  country's cause.    Nor did their patriotism spring from ambition or vain glory.    Many who acted a conspicuous part in  the great drama, and staked their all upon tho issue, had already passed the meridian of life, and some wore even veterans of half a century, whoso heads wero silvered o'er with  age, and who were fast tottering down the declivities of time.  Neither did it arise from interest or avarice: all forsook their  avocations of gain, their homes, their fire-sides, and their  friends, and enlisted in the same common cause.   And whether in the battle field, in the cabinet, or in the desk; whether  wielding the glittering sword, or flourishing the pen, that  mighty instrument of little men; or whether with the sword  of the spirit, directed by an eye of faith; all, with a firm reliance on the justice of their cause and the protection of the  God of heaven, aimed at the same great end, the freedom of  their country and the amelioration of the condition of man.  Such were the characters and such the patriotism of those  whom a world delights to honor ; whoso names, inscribed on  freedom's banner, waving at mast head, will live when all  the monuments of Egyptian and Roman greatness shall havo  crumbled into dust. Never did the moral and intellectual firmament glow with brighter constellations; never was  tbe historian's page decked with brighter gems. Ancient  Greece once boasted of a Themistocleg, of a Demosthenes,  and of Socrates; Rome, too, delighted to tell the story of a  Cicero, a Caisar, and a Constantino; but it was reserved for  us to boast of such men as a Washington, and a Warren, an  Otis, and a Jefferson—the former unrivalled in the. field, tho  latter unsurpassed in the cabinet. To such pilots, was freedom's  bark, with her little crow, intrusted in that perilous hour, when  tho darkness of the firmament and the commotion ofthe eh:-  ments, seemed to threaten destruction and extinguish hope.  Yes I then it was that this little chosen band, borne forward  in the ark of liberty, remained steadfast in their purpose, till  the dove of peace sent forth, having found whereon lo rest her  foot, returned bearing the olive leaf, which was hailed with  acclamations, which echoed and re-echoed through the length  and breadth of our happy land; which acclamations havo  been annually reiterated on the day of our national jubilee,  until the sound, wafted on the gentle breeze, has been borne  to distant climes, proclaiming man's "inalienable right to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Let but such patriotism fire the bosom of Americans, and a literary and mural  reformation would commence, which would enlighten and  christianize the world.  Editorial Correspondence. A gentleman in Boston, no less distinguished for mercantile ability and honor,  lhan for his persevering habits of mental improvement, which  he declares shall continue "as long as there is any thing to  learn," thus writes the editor of this Journal, under date of  June 12th, and embodies a historical account of tho Boston  Lyceum:—" I see by the pamphlets sent, that tho word 1 ,y-  ceum is still a favorite with you. I am glad you are. introducing it, and making it familiar at tho South. It has wrought  wonders here; no class of associations in New England  has excited so general an interest and been so successful as  Lyceums. ' Could you have entered one of our weekly meetings at the Odeon last winter, and seen Governor Everett,  our President, in the chair, and an audience of two thousand  persons, with interested and smiling countenances, wedged in  the centre, and ranged round the four extensive galleries, one  above another, from the bottom to the top of the building, you  would involuntarily, I think, have been carried back to the;  primary meeting, at ' Old Hanover,' where it devolved on  you, in a speech, to explain tho meaning of tho word Lyceum !  You cannot, I think, havo forgotten it.  "While on this subject, considering the interest you took in  tho formation of the Boston Lyceum, a brief account of its  rise and progress' may not bo uninteresting to you.

The interest with which it has been sustained, from  week to week, fair or foul, has not been exceeded, it is believed, by any similar institution in the country. Its average attendance has not been far from two thousand persons, and as  long ns it retains its present character for activity and intelligence, there can be no fear for its success.  " The Lyceum was one of the first of the. present generation of popular institutions, organized in this city, and what  contributed more in the outset to its prosperity, than any thing  else, was the introduction of ladies, which, by the way, was  not done,—it being an innovation upon custom—till after a  protracted discussion and violent opposition.  " The proposition to form a Lyceum in this city, was first  made by Josiah Holbrook, the father of Lyceums. A number of our most distinguished citizens were called together  by this gentleman, and tho subject of forming a Lyceum laid  before them. After discussing the subject several evenings,  they decided that it was impracticable, that it could not be  sustained. Mr. Holbrook then laid the matter before a small  association, then in existence. Here the expediency of forming a Lyceum was fully discussed and favorably received.  A committee was appointed, to whom the whole subject was  referred, with authority to call a public meeting, should they  think it advisable. This they did ; and it was attended prob  ably by one thousand persons. The subject of Lyceumsi  generally, and tho expediency of forming ono in this city,  as proposed by Mr. Holbrook, underwent a thorough discussion. Most of the. speakers highly approved of the plan;  but one of the gentlemen, of more talents and influence I  had almost said, than all the rest put together, and a great  friend, too, to popular education, said, that the project remind  ed him of a machine made by a friend of his—it was skilfully designed, beautifully finished, and masterly executed  but it had ono fault, it would'n't go I This threw a damper  upon the meeting, but it soon, after a little more discussion,  recovered its elasticity, and appointed a committee to draft a  plan of organization. The committee met; two of the members believed the project to be a visionary one, and declined  taking any part in it. The remaining three called another  meeting, proposed a constitution, and organized a Society.  Tho first meetings wore held at Chatinccy Hall, and were attended by about two hundred poisons. Many of tho lectures,  the first winter, wore given by tho members. From the  foundation to the present time, its numbers and interest have  been constantly increasing; and, notwithstanding its liberal  appropriations and increasing expenditures, its receipts have  thus far equalled its expenses, leaving, generally, a balance  in the treasury."  Apology.—Tho July number of the Journal has been  unavoidably delayed in consequence of the absence of the  editor, caused by sickness in his family. For the arrangement and editorial supervision of the greater part of the  present number of ihe Journal we acknowledge our indebtedness to the same gentleman who edited one of tho May numbers, J. A. Van Hoesen, Esq.  MISSISSIPPI FEMALE COLLEGE.  We learn from the Columbus Democrat, that the first nub  ic examination of the pupils of this institution commenc A  on Monday, the 14th instant, and continued till Thured-i •  during which time the young ladies were thoroughly nUe's!  tioned by their instructers, trustees, and visiters, all of which  questions they answered with promptness and correctness  We here publish the remarks of the Democrat, ton-ether  with tho address delivered by one of the young ladies of the  institution, Miss Martha Fort.  Reading.—This exercise was particularly interesting  Miss Dunning, one of the teachers, made some judicious  selections, and a class of about thirty read simultaneously  with as much distinctness as the articulations of a single  voice.  " Grammar.—This class was under the instruction of  Mrs. Shook, who examined them critically on the principles  of study; some of the pupils were vory young, and evinced  a greater knowledge of the subject than wc had anticipated.  The exercises by the first class in parsing, were highly cred-'  itable to the young ladies.  "Arithmetic.—The pupils gave ample evidence that the  plan of instruction had been shaped in such a manner as to  make them acquainted, first, with the rudiments of science,  and then its application to the practical purposes of life. The  rapidity and accuracy with which they solved the most intricate questions, were truly astonishing. Some of the Trustees  attempted to puzzle the young ladies in the calculation of interest, but they were not sharp enough. They figured out  tho questions with all the certainly of tho most grasping Shy-  lock or money lender.  "Geography.—In this branch of instruction, the young  laelies were perfectly at home. Mr. Maer put questions of  a general nature, which were answered in nearly every instance with accuracy. The map of the world appeared lo  be before them, and they traversed from continent to continent  with the rapidity of thought.  Natural Philosophy.—The class in Philosophy evinced  a degree of intelligence and good practical sense, which is  rarely to bo met with in our institutions of learning. The  President of the Institution exercised this class in such a  manner as to convince the numerous auditory that the young  adies thoroughly comprehended, to the fullest extent, the  principles of the study. Some illustrations were given which  could not fail to interest tho scientific observer.  "Botany.—Tho vegetable kingdom was illustrated by Miss  Dunning's class in tho interesting study of botany, in a very  happy manner. We never listened to a class that answered  moro clearly and understanding^ lhan this. Many of them  had been at the study but a short time, and the proficiency  they have made is certainly creditable to tho instructress and  her pupils.  "Geometry, Algebra, and Mathematics.—The classes  pursuing these kindred studies were particularly exercised  on Thursday. They gave ample evidence of comprehensive intellects and great strength of mind. Some algebraical  problems were handed in by an unknown gentleman, l°r  two young ladies to solve, which were readily done on the 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/613	613	614.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/614.jp2

"Music.—The class in this delightful science was under  the instruction of Professor Pfister. He had undoubtedly  been untiring in his duties, or his class, ( many of which were  very young) could never have undergone the severe and scrutinizing examination to which they were subjected. The  young ladies wero particularly catechised on the principles  ol the science, to which the talented Prolessor had particu  hilly directed their attention. Before the practical illustrations were given, Mr. P. delivered a short and appropriate  address to the parents and pupils, a copy of which we shall  endeavor to procure for publication. The applause which  succeeded ils delivery, was-a sure guaranty that it was well  received.  . "Professor Pfister exercised the young ladies on the  piano, accompanied by the voice, which produced a happy  effect at tho close of the examination.  " It was surprising to observe with what readiness tho  young ladies answered all questions put to them. Many of  them wero examined in all the classes, and their minds were  consequently diverted from one study to another with great  rapidity—there was no looking at tho book; they know it  all. It was indeed a gratifying scene for the President nnd  his capable assistants, to behold so noble a reward for all their  toil in ' teaching the young idea,' but how much more gratifying must it have been to parents, many of whom came from  a distance, to witness the expansion of their daughters' intellects and their increase in useful knowledge. Tho room was  crowded every day, and it is worthy of remark, that the  young gentlemen, by their polite and constant attention, con-  vinced us that they had the welfare of some of the rising  generation deeply at heart!!  "On Fiiday, Miss Martha Fort, a young lady of the  Institution, delivered tho following address to her young associates, in the Methodist Church, in the presence of a crowded auditory.  "ADDRE3S.  " One year has elapsed since the Mississippi Female Col  ego came into existence; one year, with its trials, its anxie  ties, and its toils, has passed on, bearing its unchangeable ac  count, since we first associated ourselves together in the pur  iuit of knowledge. One year of our youth has been consumed, and wherein have wo been profited? Wo trust our  precious time has not been fruitlessly wasted, or our labor  without advantage. Our friends have recently witnessed the  proofs of our acquaintance with the several branches of science to which we have devoted our time, and directed our  attention; they have seen the method pursued, in order to  discipline the mind and fit it for the duties and the trials of  life. We trust their expectations with regard to our advancement havo been fully realized; and that their kind wishes  and more substantial proofs of solicitude for our success, have  not been lavished upon ungrateful hearts.  "For ourselves, on taking a retrospeclive view of this our  first Collegiate year, do not our hearts glow with feelings of  delight and satisfaction, as we retrace the steps we have taken  in tho paths of knowledge?    And will not the hours spent  in the acquisition of intellectual wealth, be treasured by memory, as some of the most delightful hours of our existence?  To my companions in this pursuit, I would chiefly address  myself.    I shall not speak of the importance of education,  believing you are already aware of its deep and abiding influence; but leave the subject for an abler pen, and more eloquent tongue to render full justice to its merits and importance.    I shall simply speak of the influence exerted in the  world by woman, and of her duties in relation to that influence.    Nature seems, by her gifts, to have distinctly defined  the stand which each sex should occupy.    On man, she has  bestowed strength, energy, and ambition, which prompt him  to seek for empire over his fellow-men: while on woman,  she has lavished those gentler qualities which are more effectual in enchaining the heart.    But woman has ever exercised  more or less influence on the affairs of the moral and political world, and, as that influence has been exerted in the cause  of virtue (and morality—or opposed lo it, in the same ratio,  has the happiness of the human family been increased or diminished.    We need only turn over the pages of history,  from the creation to the present time, to be convinced of the  truth of this statement.    Indeed, the first transaction which  we have on record, is but a sad exemplification of this assurance, which resulted in the conversion of our beautiful paradise into a scene of toil and sorrow; from thence we find  the annals of antiquity interspersed with the names of women who have directly or indirectly exercised a most powerful influence on their affairs.    Whole nations have owed  much of their national character to tho influence of their females—some, impelled by the most ardent devotion to the  virtues of patriotism, courage, and love of liberty, have won  for themselves high and deathless names on the records of  Fame.    But those nations sunk in effeminacy, where woman  was considered but the slave of man—have soon lost their  rank among tho nations of the earth.  " Woman exercised much influence in the affairs of ancient  Greece and Rome; much of tho weal and woo of these  mighty empires maybe traced to this source. In three revolutions in the government of Rome, the influence exerted by  woman was the immediate cause; and her power saved Rome  when her victorious though banished Coriolanus appeared before her walls as the enemy of his country. We have also,  records to disprove the truth of the assertion, that woman has  not ability to govern. In tho earliest history of Assyria, wc  have an account of Scmiramis ruling with despotic sway  over a powerful kingdom, which, under her wise legislation,  increased in wealth, prosperity, and power; and who, by an  extraordinary course of splendid actions, has recorded her  name high upon the list of heroes and conquerors. Carthage,  the rival of imperial Rome, owed its existence to the energy  of woman. And, in scripture, wc read instances of women  elevated to the most honorable stations of power in the land  of Canaan. In more modern times, notwithstanding the  deep-rooted   prejudice   against   female  domination, many  & 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/614	614	615.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/615.jp2

And even nt this time, three powerful kingdoms of enlightened Europe acknowledge females as  their political heads. Bul in too many instances such power  has been obtained by energy of mind, united with those masculine qualities which have been cultivated to ihe exclusion of  these virmes which adorn and beautify the female character.  " In life annals of literature, woman holds an exalted station. By the mighty power of intellect, she has enchained  the hearts of enraptured and admiring nations ; by the simple  but magic strains of poetry, she has touched the spring which  unlocks the human heart—she has 'spread beauty all around  our paths,' and has scattered many a flowrct to beguile the  sorrows of the way-worn pilgrim through life. The character of the sex has been well sustained by the labors of a  Genlis, an Edgeworth. a Hemans, a Somerville, a Sigoumey,  and many others of our own day and country, who have won  lor themselves an imperishable name. There exists a great  diversity of sentiment with regard lo the relation which woman ought to sustain in society. Some argue that she is possessed of intellect and capacity equal to that of the other sex,  and should enjoy the same rank and privileges : while there  have been others who seemed unwilling to allow that woman  was possessed of a living soul—they would leavens to suppose, that although the Almighty had formed a shrine so  beautiful in its symmetry, so exquisite in all its arrangements,  He had neglected to place therein the Divinity worthy of  homage. Some, of both sexes, have contended for what they  are pleased to call the rights of woman, whose systems, were  •hey reduced to practice, would sacrifice those lovely and amiable qualities, the exercise of which constitute the true influence of woman.  " Woman is out of her clement when she contends for empire mid the din of battle, or seeks to give laws to nations:  such scenes are incompatible with the duties of daughter.  wife, and mother, stations of dignity and importance which  woman is called lo fill. Her empire is the heart—and, were  the relation changed, how much of the beauty and perfection  ol her character would be. sacrificed. The change might  possibly be effected, though Nature seems to have placed an  insuperable barrier to such an innovation. But custom is  second nature ;—woman, by training, might become an Amazon ; and man, by effeminacy, the most delicate, sensitive, and  helpless being in creation—but such a state of things would  fearfully distort the most beautiful feature of society. Wo  man's influence is mighty, and no less powerful because  secret and silent. Its legitimate place is the fireside and do  mestic circle; and there an impetus to action may be given,  which, like a wave of the ocean, shall be unlimited in its circumference. Such influence animated the Spartan soldier in  the battle, to which he bore his mother's command, ' return  with your shield, or upon it.' The same influence was exert  ed in the struggle of our own country for liberty; ono of the  noblest principles which can animate lhc heart of man. Had  not that high and holy principle of independence, implanted  in the bosoms of our forefathers, who, breaking asunder, the  lies which bound them to their native hind, soughtasanctini  n  the forests of the New World, where they might Ivor.  ship God according lo the dictates of their own conscience  been watered, nourished, and consecrated  ' By the tears, the anguish and ihe blood,  01 those stern martyrs tu the cause of God '  end bequeathed, as a most precious boon to their children  found so firm a strong bold in the hearts of patriotic mothers  whose motto was ' Liberty or death ;' had they not by their  heroic examples of self-denial, contempt of danger and of  death, so strengthened the hanels and encouraged the heartsof  the brave few resisting the power of the oppressor, our country  night still have been groaning beneath the yoke of tyranny.  \nd it was the exercise of womanly virtues which has reflected such a lustre upon the names of mother of the  Gracchi, and mother of Washington.  " In the dark ages of the world, when science and literature were confined to the cloister—when the blessed light of  the gospel but dimly illuminated a portion of the earth shadowed by the power of superstition—when ' might was  right,' und confusion and anarchy prevailed, our sex shared  deeply in the common degradation. But, when a brighter  dawn gleamed upon the earth, and the mind of man arose,  bursting the chains which enthralled it—when the truth of  God in its onward course dispelled the shades of ignorance  and superstition—woman was then elevated to her proper  rank, which she has ever since in all Christendom retained,  If, then, the influence of woman is so extensive and powerful,  and who will deny it, is it not all-important ihat the principles  which actuated her should be high and holy ? That she should  be divested of passions nnd weakness which are but a degradation to her nature ? That she should live for others rather  than herself? We should place high the standard of woman's  excellence, and constantly endeavor lo elevate ourselves lo  that mark, and emulate the virtues which have added so much  lustre to the character of many of our sex. It has been said  with truth : fix your eye on any object which you wish to attain and steadily persevere, surmounting every obstacle, un-  discouraged by difficulties, undismayed by dangers, and you  will eventually reach tho eminence you desire.  " The character is formed in youth, and the first years of  our existence may be considered as nn index of our future  course. Woman, then should be early impressed with a just  sense of her true importance in society ; and all training, ami  efforts for self-improvement, should be conducted with regard  to this object, The hand of God is visible in all the works  of his creation, and nowhere are such combinations of his  power manifest as in the human form, uniting strength, beaut),  and utility: but woman should not value herself for her external charms, even though these may be transcendant, and imagine because homage is so often paid to beauty, those lacu ■  ties and powers of mind which arc ctpially the gift of the-  Creator, are of less value. Though tho beholder may be  enamored with lhc beautiful casket, yet if it contain no jewe s  of corresponding value, he will soon become weary of it Wl  pass it by as a useless bauble. But beauty is evanescent. Influence must be based on a firmer support.

Tho social affections should be cultivated, and much labor bestowed to eradicate from the youth-  fill heart those unhallowed tempers and dispositions to which  so much of human happiness has been sacrificed. Selfishness should have no place in the breast of a woman. A  regard for the wants, wishes, and feelings of others, if constantly practised, will finally become a fixed habit, and afford  more pleasure than the most devoted love of self. Habitual  c.heerfulncs should not be neglected—a contented mind is a  mine of wealth—it lightens the gloom of poverty, and sheds  n cheering lustre around the fireside in tho day of the deepest  adversity. The government of the temper is one of the indispensable requisites to the perfection of female character;—  how much woe and anguish the influence of unbridled passion has caused in ihe world; how much individual suffering,  may never be known uniil tho day of final account. And,  above all, woman should be under the influence of religious  principles. Man may, possibly, without any such influence,  be guided by a high sense of honor founded on the opinions  of the world; but a woman, acknowledging no dependance  upon a supreme power—no responsibility—actuated by no  motives, save those of mere caprice—is not a being to whom  to trust one's happiness. She must be a firm believer in the  truths of revelation, and act in accordance with that belief.  Faith is one of the most beautiful traits in the female character, and a proper sense of her dependance constitutes one of  her greatest charms ; woman, then, above all others, should  never forget her dependance on that arm which is mighty to  save.  " I am addressing woman in youth, and have endeavored  thus imperfectly to sketch some of the most prominent quali  ties that 1 deem indispensably requisite in every female  These, united with a high degree of mental cultivation, and  those; graces of manner which will scarcely (ail to follow the  habitual exercise of these virtues, will constitute a character  whose influence may not be limited by the age in which she  lives. 1 look around upon my young companions, and be  bold on each brow the stamp of intellect—the broad seal of  A Imighty power. Upon each one lie has bestowed faculties,  and power of mind, of which, perhaps, we have no conception, and which might forever be dormant unless some casual  circumstance should call forth the slumbering energies of the  soul.  " Nature has bestowed upon every individual at least one  talent, and, perchance, by improvement, that one might become ten; but her gifts are valueless unless improved. Youth  is the season for such improvement. Let us then remember  that ours is a high and holy calling—that each individual,  however humble may be her situation in life, is not without  influence—an influence which it is her duty to exert in the  cause of virtue and human happiness; and may each one of  us make such improvement ofthe time, talents, and advantages which God has bestowed upon us, that we may receive  the applause of our own consciences and the just commendation of our Maker."  FOURTH OF JULY-MODERN REVOLUTIONS.  [We cannot, as journalists, belter pay our tribute to the  immortal birth-day of our National Independence than by  copious quotation from the Oration, delivered July 4, 1838,  before the Military and Civic Societies of Natchez, by C. L.  Dubuisson, Esu.]  "Willi July, 1830, commenced a series of revolutionary  movements, uninteresting, because unsuccessful, but manifesting clearly that the whole mass of human beings who  have been ' hewers of wood and drawers of water,' are  alive to their political interests, and need but a word to  rouse to desperate action. Among others, and by far  the most interesting to us, because associated to some of  our proudest recollections, was the last revolution in Poland.  Poland, bowed down and crushed by accumulated wars,  caught the sound of the clarion which rung out the victory  of the people and overthrow of the Bourbons, nnd revived  from her death-like slumber. The valor of this unhappv  nation was never doubted, but the irresistible power of her  enemies, nnd treachery of some who should have, been her  friends, crushed lhc energies and humbled the spirit of this  romantic pcoplo. But there was no want of disposition to  strike when opportunity should offer. Such an opportunity  was given ; and so soon as the glad tidings of the issue of the  French revolution was heard, the Poles rose with ono consent  and rushed, without counting the costs, and with ungovernable fury, upon their oppressors. Hard was the struggles  Feats of high daring, deeds of heroic valor were performed,  which threw far into the shade the deeds of other times;  but the struggle was vain; the cup of her misery was not  yet full; and Poland was doomed to fall again before her  proud and merciless foe. The only inheritance left that unfortunate land is the memory of her brave defenders. In  this only can she find consolation, and in this none can surpass  her, The fame of Kosciusko alone is dearer to iho homeless Pole than the richest treasures his enemies can boast.  The virtues of such men form and fashion lhc character of a  nation—they mould the public taste and public feeling. Empowered with ubiquity they restrain and chasten the selfish  desires of aspiring men. Utter but lhc name of Washington in the healing of an American, and you will see the  proud Hash from his eye. The name of Lafayette is like,  magic to the enthusiastic Frenchman. Name Kosciusko to  the Polish exiloand a tear will gush from his eye. Such men  are regarded as benefactors of mankind, and their names are.  all words of power which can conjure a spirit from the human  heart, when cold deductions of reason have no effect, and  the most eloquent appeals fall dull and tame upon the ear.  With these three names arc associated all that is grand, all that  is noble in the history of the times in which they lived. With  the name of Washington arise the scenes of the revolution,  the fields of Brandywine, Monmouth, and Trenton. What  Pole or American can hear the name of Kosciusko without  mingled emotions of admiration and regret, and without immediately thinking of the bloody siege of ninety-six, and the  glorious defence of Dubienka; and his memorable words en  resigning his commission lo the degenerate Stanislaus:  ' Grant, oh ! my God,  ihat I may once again draw m.y 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/616	616	617.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/617.jp2

If Europe is to be revolutionized it must be by such men as these, and such influences as  they exert. Willi such a battle cry it is not likely that Poland,  tho land of chivalry and romance, will rest forever in her  present abject situation. The Pole may be wary, but he will  not be timid; and when tho time is ripe he will be at his  post. Though the minion of a tyrant sit in the halls of her  princes—though the iron car of the proud Ammon of the  North, grind in tho dust the unprotected and defenceless—  though the ploughshare sink deep in the foundation of her  ancient capital—though the frozen plains of Siberia receive  ihe noblest spirits she can boast—Poland will arise from  the ashes of her desolation, fling her broad banner to the  breeze, and in the palace of St. Petersburg, '„' sound tbe  trump of freedom in the despot's ear." Years may pass,  perhaps an age, but the time will come. The severe measures against the Poles show that with all his power, the  Emperor is not without a wholesome fear of the consequences of the late Polish insurrection. And these very measures will eventually bring about the very things he would  avoid. Every exile becomes at once a missionary in the  cause for which he fought nnd suffered. The Emperor well  knows that the progress of liberal principle is rapid towards  his dominions, and that Poland is a dangerous neighbor.  Poland did not bleed in vain; she contended for proper principles, and but for the jealousies of some of her nobles, with  the proper spirit. Present sufferings will chasten and puri  fy from selfishness, without crushing her spirit.  " To the man of science and thought, no country on earth  presents so interesting a field for contemplation as Germany  From the time when Luther, with an arm of omnipotence,  swept away the night of ages, and freed tho intellect, which  had grovelled in darkness and despair, from tho shackles of  superstition; since Guttenberg put the press into successful  operation and poured into the soul an inexhaustible flood of  light, Germany has been the land of thought. In philology and tho abstruse studies of mental philosophy, and the  higher walks of poetry, the Germans have left all others far  behind—while in the science of government and practical  improvement, they have been culpably negligent. Recently,  however, there seems to have taken place a favorable change.  After the return of Bonaparte from Elba, and when all Europe was trembling before his gigantic power, the princes of  Germany, to save themselves from impending danger, made  a voluntary promise that their subjects should have a share  in the government by representation. This promise was afterwards approved and confirmed by a federal act of Vienna,  viz: there should be a separate legislative constitution.  Though these promises were never performed, and were nol  made for thai purpose, they have made a deep impression  on the minds of the people. They have shown them that  princes must sometimes play the suppliant; that the real  source of power is the people, and that the will to exercise  it makes them invincible, for without their enthusiasm and  courage Bonaparte could not have been crushed; that no  reliance could be placed on men, who, through cowardice or  treachery, would make any promise to delude their credulous subjects.    The hope of possessing a positive interest in  the government, directed their thoughts and feelings in a new  channel. Still the Germans are a slow people, nnd cannot  bo moved by sudden impulses. They regard, with apparent  indifference, but in reality with deep interest, the progress of  liberal principles among their neighbors. The emotions of  such a poople lie too deep to be observed by a passinn  glance. They gather facts and principles, and retiring into  the 'fortress of their thoughts,' ponder deeply on them.  They have not forgotten the deceitful promise of their princes  nor havo they forgotten that vengeance is due for the treachery. Reform may precede revolution, nnd fortunate will it  bo for the people and the world, if that order of things be  carried out. Should the powers that be, yield to tho tide of  popular feeling, the revolution will be silent and gradual.  but if they are so infatuated as to attempt to suppress it, no  one can foresee where it will end. The principles which  are beginning to shew themselves are our principles, and  the spirit that moves upon and troubles the waters, is the  spirit of practical freedom which sprung up with our revolution, and no human power can quell them. Opposition  may restrain for a time, but the longer the restraint continues  the more sensible will be the explosion : As the mountain  stream, whose course tbe falling avalnnche has stopped, rises  slowly and gently until it reaches the sumr.it of the obstacle, then bursts away with a force that rocks and mountains  cannot resist.  "A late German writer who is enthusiastic in tho anticipation of a revolution, says: 'Thought precedes actions, as  lightning precedes thunder. Thunder, in Germany, truly  deserves the name of German; it does not come on in successive cli-.ps, but rolls on slowly and gradually; but when you  hear a peal louder than any yet heard since the commencement of the world, then rest assured that German thunder  has struck its mark. Then shall eagles fall dead from tho  air, and lions, in the remotest desert, crawl into their royal  dens. Germany will witness tho performance of a drama,  to which the revolution of France will be but a mere idyll.  Every thing is at present calm, it is true ; and if you see a  few men here and there gesticulating violently, do not suppose that these are to bo tho actors of the great drama. They  are merely the curs that go biting about the arena, previous  to the arrival of the gladiators, who arc to figure in tho deadly combat. When the clock strikes, nations will crowd  iround Germany, as on tho stands of n great amphitheatre,  to witness vast and fearful games.'  "On the movements of Germany, depends the destiny of  a large portion of continental Europe. The influence which  the Germans possess over all minds, is very great. When  such men become excited, on such a subject, their enthusiasm must bo deep and steady. When such intellect and  learning take hold of the philosophy of utility, we may  look for results worthy of their source,  " Nor is this spirit confined to Europe alone—it has been  seen in every quarter of tho globe—in every island of the  sea. From the insular empire of Japan to the Red Sea—  from tho coral capes of Ceylon to the icy rivers of Siberia,  occasional scintillations of tbe celestial fire are stricken out 		2010-10-08	2010-10-08	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/617	617	618.jp2	/p120701coll12/image/618.jp2

The mountains of Caf  fraria, the home of tho lion and tho ostrich, have received  many intelligent freemen, who seek, in imitation of the colo  nists of Massachusetts and Virginia, an empire of equal  laws in those almost unknown numerous little republics,  which arc scattered along the Atlantic coasts of that conti  nent, professing the principles of our government—adopting  literally our constitution.  " On the American continent numerous republics have been  established in professed imitation of our own. They have  not equalled the prototype, but still they manifest a spirit of  improvement. Ono bright star alone of kindred ray has  been added to the constellation, which has long attracted the  eye of the navigator on the sea of revolution. May the  beams it throws, far to the west, teach all beholders the difference between the pure light of freedom and the flash of  the meteor that gleams through the dark wastes of revolutionary Mexico.  " Thus we have endeavored to catch a bird's eye view of  the political aspect of the world. In this excursion we have  seen that the whole mass of mankind is in commotion, anxiety and excitement, striving with energy for intellectual improvement and the advancement of liberal principles. Was  it always thus from the beginning of the world? or has  the influence of the spirit and tho dissemination of the principles, so eloquently set forth in that instrument which we  have just heard read, aroused the dormant energies of man.  " Our stars have shone on every horizon—the beacon fires  wo kindled have been answered from the hills of every land,  and the loud shout which a new-born nation sent forth has  been echoed from every mountain and reverberated through  every valley. Whenever a people have asserted their rights  with tho sword, they have cited our example. When  through toil and danger, they havo accomplished the objects  of their wishes, they have sought our alliance, and hailed us  as friends and brothers; and, when the oppressor proved too  strong, they sought an asylum and a refuge on our shores.  This is not fancy—it is sober truth."  It is a fact of which few are aware, that at Satartia, on the  Yazoo river, moulder the ruins of a dilapidated Fort, which,  during French ascendancy in this country, was tho abode and  asylum of civilized man. Though the fact that tho French,  a long time anterior to the revolution, bad a Fort upon the  Yazoo river, is incidentally mentioned in connection with the  early history of General Washington, yet little, even at that  period, seems to have been known of its locality, its object,  or its destiny; and its mention has faded from tho page of  American history, and its recollection from the mind of man.  But it is on that account encircled with unusual interest, and  clothed in imaginary grandeur; as fancy unrestrained by  fact, must weave its history, rear again its splendid but fallen  walls—people its silent arcades—string anew the lute by  which the lover softened and civilized the dusky forest maiden ; and mount the deep-mouthed cannon, whoso thunders  wero heard far along the sluggish waters of the Yazoo.  The ditch, which surrounded this once secure and majestic  Fort, is one mile in circumference, and notwithstanding a  flood of years have poured their obliterating wateTs upon it,  the depth is yet about three and a half feet. The dirt which  was thrown from it, rises about the same distance above the  surface of the surrounding country—making the distance at  present, from tho bottom of tho ditch to the top of the embankment, from six to seven feet. This ditch is perfectly circular, and must have been of a grcat depth at the time of its  completion—otherwise its every vestige would have long  since disappeared; for such is its age, that the trees which  have grown up, both in the ditch and upon the embankment,  equal in size, and have in every particular the resemblance  of those of the neighboring forests. The surface of the  earth, on the inside, is perfectly level, with the exception of  hero and there a mound, seemingly designed to give the inmates, a view and command of the river, which meanders  at a distance of two hundred yards from its north-western  boundary. Tho ruins indicate nothing of the character and  construction of tho Fort, further than the embankment and  circular ditch already described. This fort must have been  constructed as early, or nearly so, as the settlement of New  Orleans, nnd have astonished the wild Indian, before he  learned the name of the far-firmed "Natchez." Of the history of this desolate home of the soldier, the Indians themselves know but little, having left its tradition behind them, in  their chase after the wild deer of the wilderness. The only  information in relation to it was derived from an Indian, who  bore some visible traces of his French ancestry, and claimed A  to be a descendant of a Princess of Yazoos and the FrcnchW  ommandant at the Fott. He lived upon the spot at the time  the country was settled by tbe whites, and the tradition, as it  had reached him, represented tho French ns once having an  extensive and lordly possession there, of which the Fort  was the centre. They traded wilh the Indians, and attempted to posses themselves of the Yazoo valley. After years of  labor and suffering, when they believed themselves nearest  the accomplishment of their object, and tho surrounding Indians most peaceful and friendly, the Yazoos suddenly made  a descent upon them, and surprised and massacred the inhabitants of tho Fort. This, he says, originated in the maltreatment of the Princess, his maternal ancestor, by the  French ; but most probably from a desire of plunder in the  Indians.  If some lover of fiction would visit this spot, he might lay  a foundation for some of fancy's brightest and loveliest creations a theme which would render romantic tho mention ol  the wilds of Mississippi.—Canton Herald.

Samuel Parker, gives the following curious account of a broatl defile through these mountains, which affords a commodious and easy passage from the country lying  east of this grcat range to the territory on the coast ofthe Pacific. The existence of such a passage increases the importance of the steps in contemplation by our government, to occupy the territory on the Oregon.  "The passage through these mountains is in a valley, so  gradual in tho ascent and descent, that I should not have  known we were passing them, had it not been that as we advanced the atmosphere gradually became cooler, and at  length we found the perpetual snows upon our right hand  and upon our left, elevated many thousand feet above us—in  some places ten thousand. The highest part of these mountains are found by measurement to be eighteen thousand feet  above, the level of the sea. This valley was not discovered  until some years since.  " Mr. Hunt and his party, more than twenty years ago,  went near it, but did not find it, though in search of some favorable passage. It varies in width from five to twenty miles;  and following its course, tho distance through the mountains  is about eighty miles, or four days journey. Though there  are some elevations and depressions in this valley, yet, comparatively speaking, it is level. There would be no difficulty  in the way of constructing a rail road from the Atlantic to  the Pacific ocean; and probably the time may not be very far  distant, when trips will be made across the continent, as they  have been made to Niagara falls, to see nature's wonders."

In making this report in accordance with the wishes and in­struetions  of the Board, I secured the piCtures of the members  of the first Board appointed by Gen. F. T. Nicholls in 1876 and  that of t·he Board appointed by Gov. M. J. Foster in his last  administration from 1896. Others toiled as faithfully in the  interim between the terms of these two Boards and deserve  the highest appreciation from the people of this parish. I ha\'e  also secured the pwtures of Gov. M. J. Foster, President of  the State Board of Education, and State Superintendent .of  Education.J. V. Calhoun, that the-members of this Board might  transmit to their children some remembrance of those who  initiated the first movement in favor of Public Education in 1  this parish in 1876, as well as the two realous members of the  State Board, who have done so much to advance the educa­tional  facilities in this State and their co-workers in this par­ish.  I have also taken from the files of the Assumpt,ion Pio­neer-  and the minutes of the School Board the tributes pa:id the  three member,.: of the Board of 1876, who died ere this. Three  are now living and are useful and worthy citizens who ha~e  continued to take great interest in the welfare of this parish.  From the other members between 1876 and 1896 five have  died, three of \vhom had been presidents, one superintendent.  From the others, -some are to-day prominent citizens of t~is  parish and others have acquired fame in other parts of the  State, among whom may be noted Capt. Lewis Guion, who be­came  assistant Postmaster in New Orleans and Refiner of the  U. S. Mint, and Senator Wm. E. Howell, who besides being a  conspicuous figure in the State Senate, is the head of the  White Republican Party of the State.

Monnot, who preceded him ; and a strange coincidence is  that the same is true of the superintendents, as Mr. Lawrence  H ~ Pugh, my predecessor, who so ably agitated the school  enthusiasm in this parish, and myself, are the only two.  I passed the different workings of the various boards hur­riedly  on account of the disadvantages they were confronted  with, which would render comparisons unfair, but I endeavored  to give the Board an idea of the situation, that their courage  might not falter, but that their noble work be continued. Two  landmarks of this parish who have contributed largely to the  advancement of education, although they never were members  of the boards, are Col. W. W. Pugh, better than whom no man  ever served his coutry, and Mr. Nathan Webster, one of the  most cultured gentlemen of this parish. They have both  passed four score years, and this work by either of them would  have been a treat that we all would have relished. Col.  Pugh's facil e pen often grace our local paper to this day, and  if turned in this direction would prove very interesting. I  published in this report also an address delivered by myself in  Mansfield, La., that I considered germane to this question, and  also other addresses from men who ne\·er fail to prove inter­esting.  I leave it to you ; if any good results from this re­port  1 will be satisfied. If not, it is needless to say that I will  be disappointed bu t for a tim e, and will renew my efforts at  some futur~ day.  0  • 		2014-07-15	2014-07-15	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/802	802	803.pdfpage	/p120701coll12/image/803.pdfpage

On the 12th of May, 1877, the first parish school hoard  under the Nicholls administration qualified befor~ Judge Alfred  Tete, parish judge at that time. That board was composed of  Messrs. William Martineau Marks, President; Joseph E. Le  Blan~. Secretary and 8uperintendeut; Ernest L. NJonnot,  Simon A. Truxillo, Oscar F. Hebert and Dr. R. R. Beasley,  and thr~oe colored men, to wit: \Vashington Brown, Surrey  Jennings and Isaac Brooks.  'rhis board found nothing but chaos - no organiza­tion,  no system, and the sum of $155.72. 'rhere was a contest  pending for the treasurer's office and Superintendent LeBlanc  had to keep the fqnds until matters conld be settled.  'fhey divided the parish into twelve school districts. and  began their acti\'e work under these gr::we - diffieuHie~. One of  the grea.t troubles was to get suitable sehool houses a.nd to  furnish them. They had to fln·.Y a. rent of ~to pee' rnon th, and  besides buy benehes, desks, ete.

On the 14th day of M .uch. 1881, the labor of this board  -was interrupt.ed by the death of their efficient secretary and  s uperintendent, Oscar F.

Of course, this 1s not the  fault of the Police Jury, but of necescsitous circumstances.  Despite all this by great economy and good management.  the board was enabled to improve the teachers and manage  tlte schools with credit to themselves. Dr. Thos. B. Pugh, C.  C. Clifton and Anatole E . Hebert became members during this  term.  On September 23, 1895, the present Board was organized  with Dr. A. A. Aucoin as preside&lt;t and John Marks was re­e  lected Superintendent. Messrs. E. L. Monnot and Gen. W.  R. Ratlifi had been appointed members but refused to qualify.  Tlw new board had but OOEl other change and that was Mr.  Elg&lt;trd Aucoin to Anatole A. Achee. You Gentlemen, now  constitute the ooard and I will not sing our praise. · We know  under what difficulties we labored and the public knows what  we have accomplished. I will simply give you facts that you  may guide yourselves for the future and remedy past evils.  I feel that the following suggestion, which you have partly  put into practice was a.step in the right direction, viz:-  "I will preface my remarks by stating that I deem it abso­lutely  essential for the board to divide the parish into school  districts and to own lots and school buildings in every school  district. It is ceri.ainly wrong for the board to rent shanties  f or s0hool houses, and 1 would suggest that the rent system be  done away with, and tha.t wherever the patrons al'e unwilling  to furnish a suitable building that no school be established or·  maintained. 'rhe sentiment, wherever I have be-en. seems to  favor the donation to the School Board of lots and raising  funds to erect building that will reflect eredit to the board and  the C01'l1n:Jl;l1ity, and elevate the ideas of t.he youths by the im­posing  appearance of such edifices dedicated Lo that purpose  alone.

Page 24																															I  ABSTRACT OF ADDRESS  By Eon. J.- V. (;alhoun, State Superintendent of 'Public; Educa-  ,, \,. tion.  Superintendent Calhoun alluded to the kind and encour­aging  remarks of Judg-e Hall in his address of welcome to the  convention, and said that wherever the superintendents had  held their annual meetings, they were received by thecorumu­nities  with every mark of· honor and every tender of hospi­tality;  f1nq -we are not vain enough to mistake the mtlaning of  this def~n~ ritial arid-fri e ,1dly entertainment and to consider it  directe~ .lo us in our· hdividual characters. but as repr'esenta­tives  of th~ great work of public instruction and education.  The parish superinten¢!ent is an object of peculiar interest to  the people of the State,- because he is engaged in the pmctical ·  ex,per·iment uporf' a work csmcerning which so many tons of.  sj)eculative th eory are yearly published . While this is an age  of much il,bstraction, a time when almost every ·bocly out of his  'teens desires to put his thoughts intu p1~int, it is eminently  an age' of test and practice. and the man who can do something  is set far above one who can only talk a thing OJ' write about,  it. Hence thA "'chool superintendent is an object of special  public interest. because he is dow.n in the field of educational  work, testing the practical value of the many principles and  plans of ed1wation so abundantly pmmulgated by the numer­ous  philosophees and intellectual philanthropists of the age.  And tnis leads to the reflection that modern educat,ion is  yearly growing more pl'actical in it~ character as it widens in  extent. Men seek knowled.ze of that kind which realizes some  visible and useful result. The C.ay has passed ""hen education  wa&lt;i:limitecl to an acquaintance with Latin grammar and the  La.t.i.n l&lt;;~.nguage, the history of t,he Romans ancl their customs  in peace and war. While these subjects are recognized as usP.­ful,  they are no longer regarded as all-sufficient. The range  of education has been veered fmm pa.st ages to the present.  We teach children English before teaching them Latin.

And every child in the country of elther sex, and of any  class in society. can acquire in our public schools th~ elements  of learning and the advane;ed instruction required to fit him  for any ~tation in private ot· public life. 'I'hey are preparatory  schools for the mechanical and industrial occupations, as well  as for the elegant arts and the learned pl'Ofessions. It was a  mist,aken remark made yesterday on the train by one of our  distinguished legislators that our schools afford the scantest  rudiments of an education ; for we all know that the public  school~ present an open passage from the lowest plat:Je to the  highest summits of learning. From the time that the child  ~teps upon the threshold · of his first school he moves forward  thr-ough the halls of varied learning until he emerges an hon­ored  graduate from the doors of the university.  In the primary and intermediate schools the law requires  every child to be taught the branches of orthography, reading,  wt·iting. arithmetic, geography. grammar. United States his­tory,  and the laws of health ; the~H branehes are to be taught  in every district. a,nd in addition to these such others as the  State board of educmtion and the parish school board may re­quire.  The knowledge of these subjects is absolutely neces­sary  for citizenship. ior manhood, for ever.v dne who wishes  to bear the stamr of his species and to be elevateu above the  lfwel of t.he brute.  'l'l?e acquisition of this fundam ental knowledge will require  six or seven years ; it is all that the State considers · itsElf  hound to ~dve gra1uitiously, and fl.l! that is accepted by about  9Ei M P7 per cent of all enrolled in the schools.  Having passed thenug11 the primary and the inteemediate  schools, those who ar-e ambitious to push their studies still  hig·her and \Vho can afford the necessary sacrifice of time and  mnney, can, undr1r· the prl~se nt practice. entet· the high schools;  where thf'y may remfl,in until thb age of eighteen, and obtain  either a classical or scientifi ~ed u cation, more or Jess complete.  according to theit· c ircumstances, their talents, and their con-·  duct,.

Our ancestors were no less desirous of obtaining education  than we are, for we find as far back as ltl08 engraft.ed in our  Constitution a provjsion authr.dzing the establishment of  elementary schools. Either because the constitutional pro·  vision was never put into effect, or because it was deemed im·  practicable· at the time to can·y into effect such a provisio1,  the Constitution of 1812 left out the ar1ticle on the subject and  made no mention of the subject of education. .  Our ancestors must have had the. thirst for education des­pite  the 'fact; for when the legislature of 1814 met an aet was  passed providing for the establishment of parish public schools  and placing their supervision in the hands of the police jury.  The appropriation of $600 for each parish per an,mm at that  time when our 'population wa"- proportionately_ small, proved  too meagre to d~velop a successful system and the small ap­propriation  as a guise for economy \Vas.· shown at that time a  dismal fa'ilure, although some of the nineteenth century states·  men do not seem to have been benefitted by t,he lesson. In 1::521  t.he leg1slature experimented with p,n increase to $800 and in  182i the a.ppropriation a()'ain increased ·t.o $1350.  The appropriations ,fer·e so limited that the funds in all that  time were never nsed for elementary 'schools, but·wer·e turned  over to · instifvtions limited by law to receive eigbt. indigent  pupils f.or ipstt·oction. 'l'bere was no plan of' the public scbool  system .thouglxt· of, and as a result. the eight indigent pupils  were expPcted to come to this high place to acquire even the  common habits of decent living, with a range of ideas and a  voc~bularyso limited, confused and overwhelmed by a ·life as  strange and exacting as if the children of an Ol'dinary primary  common school of to-day were sndC:enly shot into the society of  Windsor Castle or stranded tn the academic groves of Oxford  or Cam bridge. From year 'to year numerous'aet.s were passed  for the assistanee of schools and the endO\rmelits of academies  and collel!es, but the first sys·eril of public schools came to  light only in 1845. and then the idea and th~ system d1d not be'  come realities llltti! 184i when the syEtNJJ bec·ame opc:&gt;rative.

We have heard many wise suggestions and helpful plans  for increasinsr the efficiency of the school machinery, the em­ployment  of teachers, the exam~nation of eandidates, the man­a.  czement of 1'11venue" and the location of school houses. 'I'hese  :1re all good. and vvill bear frlllt in the coming years. Much  h 1s also bee11 ~aid about the hign schools, a!ld the graded  s -,hools of the towns and villages; and this, too, will bring good  r•sult.s in the future. But the most urg·ent necessity of tl::e  s ~hnols in every one of your pru·ishPs, has not yet lJee;J pointed  oqt; and I desire to spend the time given me, in discussing a  single point, the c.:.ourse of study in the country schools.  Our high schools are now well on their feet, and for the  most part. are doing excellent work. A marvellous improve­ment  has been made in the course of study and in the methods  of instruction used in these schools. Go i.ntn the high schools  o • Shreveport, Lake Charles, Opelousas or Hammond, and you  will find much the same course of study, and about the same  treatment of the several subjects in the course, as one would  find in the hi!!h schools of towns of the same population in  Minnesota. Ohio or California. The 'houses are not so impos­ing  · in appearanc•e. and the revenues devoted to maintenance  of the schoqls are not so ample, but you will see the same lab­oratory  work in the sciences, the same sympathetic study of  the masterpieces of literature, the same thorough mastery of  English composition, the same cultivation of voice and the  Rarne development of the artistic feeling and expression. In  these and a dozen other places you will find a modern, up-to­date  nineteenth century high schooL abreast of the world's  current of thouv,ht, seeking culture and power for its students,  instead of routine cramming-, or coaching for entrance exam­ination  at college. 'rhese High schools have become the peo­ples's  colleges. training schools for the business of life, dear to  the hearts of pupils and parents, and the pride of the superin­tendents  whose fostering care has developed and perfected  them.  But go into a remote country school of any parish repre­sented  by the superintendents and school board presidents  here present, and note the difference.

In anolber parish which I visited s"me years ago,  a deserted fl::tt boat was useJ for the s chool house; and in an­oth  e r an old w are bou ~:e now serves that honorable purpose.  I~our years a.go, th8 parish of l~' n1t1 kl i n. now represented by  Supe rint e nd ent.

Happily  it is now rap1dly r etrieving its stand-ing in this matter, and has  built good houses at Wi nns boro. Crowville. Gilbert and Holly  Grove, a good work that will prove a. monument to the zea.l of  Dr. Guice and the gentlemen who succeed him in the work.  'rhere are good houses 'in sotrJ8 · parishes. Vermilion has  put up some excellent ones, St. Martin has followed her ne igh­bor's  good example, Cad··!o has set an example in this respc~ ct  worthy of imitation by her Nor-th Louisiana sistet· par-ishes,  Caleasieu has most-of her children well housed, and DeSoto  who is entertaining our conven'tion to-day. has just abandoned  the last diet-floor school hous:e for one of modern construction.  There are good country school houses, but they are t-he excep­tion,  not the rule. In· a parish adjoining this one, and its  superintendent is here to confirm the ·statement. thE&gt;re is not a  single one of its forty or more school houses outside of the  towns that contains a stove or any other device for heating  the building. Most of the houses·. have neit-her windows nor  doors, only open spaces in the walls for light and entrance.  With such aceomrnodations it is hardly to be expected that the  instruction offered to the country children would be of a mo­dern  character. But even where the houses are better. it is  the exception to find any but the most antiquated methods of  instruction, the most primitive text-books, and the most  meagre study.  It is most remarkable that in sections of the country where  farmers use sulky-plows in their cane-fields, improved &lt;cult.iva­tors  for their cotton crops and self-binders and steam threshers  on their rice plantations, they should be content to have their  children's minds and souls cultivated bv methods that were  contemporaneous with the flail and sick-le and ·wooden mold­boat  ·d.

Do you say that. the old dogmatic method of the country  school has made the best men the nation has ever produced ?  Say rather, that some of the boy~ were so strong in inher·­itance  that rod and ferule and diet of dry bones could not  utterly destroy the inspiration tliat nature had breathed into  their souls. The great men that have come out of the aull  lifeless teaching of such schools, and have afterward taken  place among the leaders of thought and acti~:m, are the excep­tions,  made conspicuous by the contras_t, with the multitudes of  their companions who left school to accept with resignation a  life of drudgery and mediocrity.  The rural schools should have just as sound instructwn,  just as good books, just as capable teachers. just a.s broad and  rich a course of study as tbe best school in city or town. Is it  not extraordinary that in all these country schools of ours th@  course of study rema.ins just as it was balE a cent.ury a.gp?  Excep tions th ere are, it is true, but they only emphasize the  rule; Superintendent Newman here, has introduced free hand  drawing intu his West F'elicia.na, schools; Judge Lowry is  having singing taught in the country schools of Bossier par·  ish.

The practical pa.rt of this inquiry is this: What can the  parish superintendents do to\vards extending and enriching the  course of study of the country schools.

As well IQight one ask if  antifebrine and salol can be used in treating country children  for typhoid fever. Stripped of a few external differences, the  child is the same all over the world, and whatever is good for  the body of the Swede or Italian, is equally good for the Cana­dian  or Mexican chil&lt;:l ; and what is good food for the soul of  the Lake Charle!'l or .Alexa-ndria chid in the first year of his  school life, is good for the child of .Attakapas prairie or the  Tensas river-plain or the Vernon pine forest.  Gentlemen Of the Superintendents's Convention, you have  reason to be proud of the advancement made in your work  within the past decade. You have established eightGen or  twenty strong high· schools in the State, and have created a  growing demand for the establishment of at least O"(le such  school in every parish. You have replaced many untrained  ' teachers with · young men and women who have received a  careful and intelligent preperation for tl)eir responsible posi­tions  in ,the sc):w.ol' economy of the State. You have raised the  standard 'of scholarship demanded of every·applicant for the  pari~h certificate ;. alld have developed an equitable and  rational· system of examinations·. "You have mme than treble!d  the revenues derived from local taxation for the support of  the schools. And you have placed before the children of the  ; town··and city schools a cullrs~ of stucfy su~ted to the condi­tions  that exist at the close of the nineteenth century. Let  me urge you to do a similar service for the hundred thousand  children in the country schools. Give them suC;h a course of  instruction as will make the farmers' children the peers of the  . most favored pupils of the city. and every beneficiary of the  schools will rise up and call you blessed."

Beasley has fallen a victim to the disease, in his  thirty-third yea•·. ,  It ;s so often the qustom of the living to speak in eulogistic t erms  of the dead, and tombstones so frequently convey the feelings of the  surviving friends instead of the truth. tha.t we hesitate to express  our feeling in regard to one who so •·ecently moved in our midst, en­dowed  with those good qualities which endeared him to all with  whom he came in contact, professionally and socially.  As a physician, citizen and friend, h€- was known to our com  munity and had the good will of aH; he was public-spirited and per­formed  his duties as ·a man and Christian.

As a  member of the Vestr.v of Christ Church, of the Board of F~dncation.  Board of Health, and Parish PhyRieian. he evinced a dispoiiition to  pe1·form all the duties incumbent on· a g•&gt;od and Joyal citizen. ln  his death the public has much to regret, and will . sinee•·ely mourn  his early departm·e from the scene of his labor and use fu lne,..s.

A!lsumption i~ again called upon to mourn one of its most pt·omi­neut,  useful and hig-hly esteemed citizens, who departed this life on  the 2~ ult. Wm. tiL i\larks, was hom in Liverpool, England, Apt·il  :o!l, Ut!6, and eame to Louisiana December 30, 1838, at the instance of  a.n elder brother, who was connected with the banking institutions  of 1,his State, in which the subject of this sketch was employed in  sorue capacity suited t.o his youthful business knowledge and ex­perience.  Aftet· being thus engaged a year or so, he euterell Cape  Oirardea u C:ollege. having- for classmates the late Juclge Desire Le­Blanc  of this pal'ish and Senator Bogy of Missouri, of whom he often  spoke in the most eulog;stic terms. Being an assiduous. close stu­dent,  he gra.cluated with distinction. especially in mathematics and  the modern languages. Upon the completion of his curriculum he  established his residence in this parish, where for over twenty  yean;, he was constantly engaged in teaching. His former pupils  are scattered all over the State. and can now be found in all the  various departments of professional, commercial , mechanical and  agl'icultural life. As an instructm· Mr. Mad&lt;s was pre-eminently  successful, and his retirement from the cans~ of education to enter  upon the I ega l pmfession was a subject of profound regret in · this  section. The extensive acquaintance. hig-h moral character and in­dn~  trious business habits. added to an excellent practical knowledge  of law, soon gained for him a very remunerative practice. But  finding the profession uncongenial to his tastes, he abandoned it and  embarked in comme1·ci a\ pursuits, in which he was actively occupied  up to his death. During· the war he was a private in the Donaldson  Cannoneers, and served with that famous battet·y in all its splendid  achievements in the a1·rny of Northern Virginia.  In every avocation in whieh our friend embarked, from his early  residence he1·e to the day of his death, he never fol'feited the re­spt&gt;  ct, confid.ence or g-ood will of a single individual with whom he  came in soc 1al or business contact; and when death eame to sever  hi~ conne~tiOn with the struggles of life it held in its icy embrace  the remaws of an upright, honorable, pure Christian gentleman.

Page 52																															• I  30  In Memoriam.  OSCAR F. HEBERT .  (Extract proceeedings special session Board of School Direc tors, March 14, 1881.)  Oscar F. Hebert was the son of late Evariste Hebert and Eulalie  Labadie, anrl was born in this parish where he died aged 38 yeats.  His father, who left a large family of sons and two daughters born  of the first marri! •. ge, unlike most of our Creole pan•nts of means,  bestowed upon his children an t-xcellent education, the on}y precious  leg·acy he left them after the vicissitudes of the late internecine con­flict.  Several of his sons have occupied prominent public positions  with credit and honor to themselves. The subject of this sketch,  when his education was completed, found his country blazing with  the fires of civil strife, which burst .forth with terrific intensity  throug-hout our whole borders, and never ceased until the strong  arm of the National author; ty prevailed. As soon as the tocsin of  war called the defenders of our soil to arms, he was among the first  to buckle on his armor to do battle for his native South.  EnFstin!!' in the 4th La. Infantry, (the immortal Allen 's Reg;.  ment) he followed its fortunes from first to last, participating in all  its memorable achievements. At the. close of the bloody struggle  he •·eturned to civil pursuits, employing himself teaching school and  music, and f01· a time in mercantileandothervariedoccupations. In  the feadul yellow fever epidemic of 1878, he resided in the illfated  village of Labadieville, where he signalized his moral heroism, py  caring fo r its unhappy victims at every personal risk and sacrifice.  His noble disinterested kipduess and attention to the sick during  that destructive pestilence is still fresh in the recollection of our  people.  Mr. Hebert, at the time of his death occupied the office of Justice  of the Peace and was also a member of the School Board. About  twelve years ago he married a lovely youn~ lad.v of this town, Mittie  D.ver. who, with three young children, are left to weep over the  model husband and father.  Now we are admonished b.v the limited space left in our columns  that we must terminate this labor of love ; that we must say fare·  well to the brave soldier, the good ::lamaritan of '78, the examplar.v  citizen , the circumspect Christian, the fobd husband,indulgent father,  the devoted friend, who has left b&lt;Jhind him a name and character  stainless and unsullied. · 		2014-07-15	2014-07-15	http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p120701coll12/id/848	848	849.pdfpage	/p120701coll12/image/849.pdfpage
