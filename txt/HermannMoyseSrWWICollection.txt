World War, 1914-1918--France; Military training camps--Arkansas	This folder contains eleven letters from February 20 through August 1, 1917, written by Hermann Moyse to his parents Simon and Flora Moyse, and to Rosalie Gottlieb, while he was in a small town in France, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and at Citizens Training Camp at Fort Logan H. Roots in Arkansas.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moyse relates his first impressions of Fort Logan H. Roots, including mealtimes, lodging, the initial physical examination, daily activities, and training in bayonet fighting and trench warfare (ca. May 1917; Aug. 1, 1917).  He also mentions General Woods’s message to the young recruits to "devote ourselves to the work in hand so that when we took charge of men those men would have a sporting chance at least" (June 9, 1917), and writes of recent social events including a Zeta Beta Tau fraternity dance and other parties at LSU, as well as engagements and weddings of mutual friends (June 9 and 23, 1917; July 22, 1917).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moyse states his determination to devote himself wholeheartedly to his training in order to become the best soldier possible, declaring in a letter to his parents dated July 22, 1917, "that no matter what happens I am a better man for having been at this camp" and his "one hope, if I am granted a commission, is not that I shall acquire fame, but that I may be able properly to look after the men placed under my charge."

Folder 1a-04, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1917 circa Aug.-Oct. 27	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985	1917	10 letters.	en	correspondence	Fort Logan H. Roots (Ark.); Camp MacArthur (Tex.)	World War, 1914-1918; Military training camps--Arkansas; Military training camps--Texas	This folder contains ten letters from August through October 27, 1917, written by Hermann Moyse to his parents Simon and Flora Moyse, and to Rosalie Gottlieb, while he was at Citizens Training Camp at Fort Logan H. Roots in Arkansas and at Camp MacArthur in Waco, Texas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moyse discusses the end of his time at Citizens Training Camp, noting in a letter to Gottlieb his and other recruits' high spirits and that his time at camp has "greatly improved my ideas on human nature to be here and to see fellows working so steadily" for the common good.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also writes about his initial impressions of Camp MacArthur (Sept. 5, 1917); his wish for peace in the coming year (Sept. 14, 1917); his tent-mates at Camp MacArthur, his life there, and how rapidly the camp is growing (Sept. 15 and 17, 1917); and finally about taking an advanced French language course, noting that to hear his Swiss teacher "speak about France, Belgium and the War (she came to America just after the beginning of the War) is to realize for the first time what a tragedy it has been" (Oct. 20, 1917).  Throughout the letters, he also relays news of mutual acquaintances.

Folder 1a-05, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1917 Nov. 5-Dec. 24, undated	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985	1917	10 letters.	en	correspondence	Camp MacArthur (Tex.); New York (N.Y.)	World War, 1914-1918; Military training camps--Arkansas	This folder contains ten letters from November 5 through December 30, 1917, seven of which were written by Hermann Moyse during his time at Camp MacArthur in Waco, Texas, and two of which are from Moyse during a brief trip to New York City before his departure for France.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight of the letters are to Rosalie Gottlieb and one letter is to Moyse's sister Harriet Sommer.  The tenth letter is a Special Order from Lt. Colonel E. H. Dearmond, dated December 22, 1917, dictating that Moyse report to the Commanding General, Port of Embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey, "prepared for extended field service."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the letters from Camp MacArthur, Moyse describes his experiences there, including his bayonet training course, which he particularly enjoyed.  In a letter to Gottlieb dated November 13, 1917, he writes "I wonder if the fact that the French slang phrase for the bayonet is rosalie has something to do with my liking it so well?"  In the same letter, he mentions a visit from several French officers, describing their brightly colored uniforms and genial nature.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another letter to Gottlieb dated December 17, 1917, Moyse writes of a football game between Camp MacArthur and Camp Funston (Leavenworth, Ks.), during which three bands played 'The Star-spangled Banner,' leading the twenty thousand soldiers present to rise 'en masse with right hand at salute to pay tribute to what the national anthem means and represents', calling it 'the most stirring patriotic display' he had ever seen.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other letters mention mutual acquaintances and recent LSU football games.

Folder 1a-07, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 March 28-April 20	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985	1918	4 letters.	en	correspondence	France	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains four letters from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb, written during his time in France with the 32nd Division, American Expeditionary Forces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moyse describes his experiences 'installing' French soldiers in various towns (April 6, 1918) and how proud he is of his fellow soldiers who are always willing to take on any task, no matter how menial, without hesitation or complaint (April 14, 1918).  On April 20, 1918, the third-month anniversary of his arrival in France, Moyse describes his arrival in the country from England: the crowd of French children who greeted the soldiers, asking for American coins as souvenirs; the French lady who raised the American flag when she saw the soldiers arrive; and the generally enthusiastic welcome he received.  Moyse also mentions how welcome letters from Gottlieb are, particularly when she writes of "engagements, weddings, [and] scandals."

Folder 1a-08, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 April 27-June 3	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985	1918	6 letters.	en	correspondence	France	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains six letters from April 27 through June 2, 1918, from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  Moyse mentions his eagerness to experience trench warfare and writes that the censor prevents him from telling Gottlieb too many details about the work he is doing (May 26).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his letter from May 5, Moyse tells Gottlieb how much he misses her: "If you would know how often you are in my thoughts you would realize that I don't need the Dodge sedan, in which I usually ride these days, to carry me back in spirit to 701 Convention St.  It very often happens, however, that while the old Dodge is taking me up a wonderful French hillside road and I am looking down into a magnificent valley below, I am really not seeing French soil but a little corner of Louisiana many miles away."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praising the stoicism of the French people in a letter from June 2, Moyse writes, "[W]ar can't break the spirit of men who have such a love of country sunk so deeply into them."  As for people who say 'that this war is unbearable, that it is about to drive them crazy,' Moyse advises Gottlieb to "just tell them that civilians have lived under the shadow of guns for almost four years, that soldiers have faced the enemy's fire for that same length of time, and that, despite these facts they are living tranquilly and attending to business.  Just one more thing, tell them - if they want to end this war, get into it with both feet - mobilize America's workmen just as her soldiers have been mobilized."

Folder 1a-09, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 June 10-June 25	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Kelton, Robert Hall Campbell, 1872-1922	1918	4 letters.	en	correspondence	France	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains four items from June 10 through June 25, 1918, including three letters from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The folder also contains a general order from the Third Division Headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces, dated June 25, 1918, and signed 'By command of Major General Dickman: Robert H. C. Kelton, Colonel, General Staff, Chief of Staff.'  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The general order is a translation of a proclamation from the mayor of Meaux, France, commending the soldiers from the Third Division for their "valor" and "efficiency."  The mayor declares that the people of Meaux "will never forget how, when their homes were threatened in the early days of June, the Third Division of the American Army came victoriously to protect them."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the letters to Gottlieb, Moyse writes that he is finally experiencing life in the trenches.  He declares that he does not regret his decision to enlist in the army, noting that "any physical discomforts that I may suffer will be more than offset by the belief and realization that every able bodied American who can possibly do so should not be satisfied until he is actually fighting the Bosche" (June 10).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a letter from June 16, he tells Gottlieb that there are many rats in the trenches, noting that he is "certain that hundreds of those oversized rodents owe their sudden death in 'No Man's Land' to the fact that they have been taken for that far greater pest, Germans."

Folder 1a-10, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 June 29-Aug. 19	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Sommer, Lydie, 1903-1981; Sommer, Ray, 1906-1995; Kelton, Robert Hall Campbell, 1872-1922	1918	10 letters.	en	correspondence	France; Baton Rouge (La.); Blois (France)	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains ten items from June 29 through August 19, 1918, nine of which are letters and one of which is a general order from the Third Division Headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The general order is dated August 4, 1918, signed 'By command of Major General Dickman: Robert H. C. Kelton, Colonel, General Staff, Chief of Staff,' and commends the troops of the VIth and Xth Divisions on their "remarkable valor."  Seven of the letters are from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb, one of the letters is from Moyse to his parents Simon and Flora Moyse, and the ninth letter is a note from Moyse's nieces Lydie and Ray Sommer, dated August 3, stating that they read in the paper that the 32nd Division, "(Uncle Hermann's division)," is "fighting in the big offensive or that is what we thought.  Grandpa says that it means that hes in active service but is holding a quiet sector at Vosges [.] We see now that Grandpa was wrong."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moyse writes to Gottlieb on July 7 about having completed his first stint in the trenches, and describes the Fourth of July celebration he attended and how the festivities made the day the most enjoyable one he has experienced thus far in France.  The most "stirring" event of the day occurred when "about fifty little girls, all [] in their native costumes, sang one stanza and the chorus of the 'Star Spangled Banner,' in English, their accent adding considerably to the significance of their expression of the hope that the good old flag may long fly over the 'land of the free and the home of the brave.' [] I tell you; it made a fellow feel good!"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moyse was shot three times in battle on July 31, 1918, and sent to a hospital in Blois, France, to recuperate.  In a letter to his parents dated August 16, he assures them he is making a speedy recovery.  Describing his injuries, he recognizes "that there are so many others who have so much more serious wounds and pains that it would be wrong for me to complain; please look at it in the same way.  Oh folks, if you could see what the Huns in their rule of terrorism have done to this country you would willingly sacrifice not merely worldly goods but life itself in order that our own America may be forever spared such a visitation, for Germany victorious would have meant an America ruined.  Don't let our own little griefs and pains make us blind to the truth."

Folder 1a-12, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 Oct. 25-Nov. 22	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; L., Harry; Geisenberger, A. H.; Connor, W. D.; Irwin, E. L.	1918	12 letters.	en	correspondence	France; Nice (France); Blois (France); Natchez (Miss.); Tours (France); Alpena (Mich.)	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains twelve items dating from October 25 through November 22, 1918, including seven letters from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The folder also contains a note from October 25 stating that Moyse was wounded on July 31 and authorizing his 'wound Chevron,' a telegram from November 11 from A. H. Geisenberger to Moyse's family in Baton Rouge with the message: "Congratulations.  May our boys be soon safely home," and Special Orders No. 248 from the American Expeditionary Forces Headquarters stating that Moyse 'is assigned to duty in the Office of the Adjutant General' (November 15, 1918).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The two other items in the folder are a letter from C. T. Park to Moyse from November 14, 1918, in which Park inquires about Moyse's recovery and a letter from an army captain named E. L. Irwin to Moyse in which Irwin congratulates Moyse on receiving the Distinguished Service Cross and notes "your division has done noble fighting throughout the entire of its history and deserves untold praise" (November 20, 1918.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  In the letters to Gottlieb, Moyse describes his trip to Nice and Monte Carlo where he spent his leave and how beautiful the French Riviera is (October 25, November 2).  Moyse also mentions visiting relatives in Paris and going to his paternal grandparents' graves, hoping it will be a 'satisfaction' to his father that he was able to make the 'pilgrimage' (November 2).  In a letter from November 13, Moyse writes about the celebration that erupted once news arrived that the war was over.  French people and Americans alike "went down the streets arm in arm, everybody who wasn't singing was yelling, beating drums or making some other sort of noise."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He sends his condolences to Gottlieb in a letter from November 18 upon receiving word that Gottlieb's brother Ike had died.  In the same letter, he writes that a good friend of his in the army had been killed in action in October.  In the final letter in the folder, dated November 22, Moyse tells Gottlieb how anxious he is to return home.

Folder 1a-13, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 Nov. 28-Dec. 11	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985	1918	4 letters.	en	correspondence	Tours (France)	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains four letters from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb from November 28 through December 11, written from Tours, France, where he was working in the Office of the Adjutant General.  In a letter dated November 28, Moyse wishes Gottlieb a happy Thanksgiving, declaring "we can all find plenty today for which to be thankful, for we may even be thankful that those who were taken away gave themselves in so great a cause."  He writes that he has finally fully realized that the war is over and that he is eagerly anticipating his return to Louisiana (December 2).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a letter from December 6, Moyse mentions having run into eight fellow soldiers from training camp at Fort Logan H. Roots, and marvels at the noticeable change to the town of Gières ("acres and acres of storage warehouses, miles and miles of switches and spurs, an ice plant, with a refrigerating plant attached, bakeries, and heaven only knows what") due to the American presence in the region.  Moyse describes his visit to a local museum in Tours, as well as to the Cathedral of Tours and the Basilique St-Martin.  Although he enjoyed his visit of the town, he relates that he is less interested in 'things' after having experienced war, and while he acknowledges that "war is horrible [and] its sufferings terrible," he does not "believe that a man who has been through it can help but be the better for having seen its horrors" (December 11).

In the letters to Gottlieb, Moyse writes of various dinners and evenings spent with old friends and fellow soldiers with whom he had lost contact over the course of the war.  He also writes about his first time in a French movie theatre, mentioning that he prefers American movies to French ones (December 19).  Moyse also gives Gottlieb more information on his deceased soldier friend, Bill Weine, declaring him one of the "truest Americans" he ever knew (December 23).  In his final letter in the folder, Moyse describes his brief visit to Paris for Christmas, marveling at the beauty of the city and the excitement in the streets and noting the "sufficiency of light to make one feel that the world is bright again" (December 28).

Folder 1a-16, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1919 Feb.	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Stovall, Hubert B.; Requichot, Henry L. M. J.; Mitchell, H. D.; Connor, W. D.; S. [last name unknown], Archie	1918	13 letters.	en; fr	correspondence	Tours (France); France; Paris (France); Germany	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains thirteen letters from February 1 through February 28, 1919, eight of which were written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  On February 6, Moyse writes to Gottlieb with the news that he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre with palm, which is the 'highest award that can be given to an officer before the grade of general by the French, the Legion of Honor excepted.'  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The folder also contains letters from fellow soldiers Hubert B. Stovall and Archie S. [last name unknown], as well as a letter from a French Major General named Henry L. M. J. Requichot in which he "agrees to attend Moyse's decoration ceremony" (February 18).  Stovall writes to congratulate Moyse on being awarded the prestigious Croix de Guerre with palm (February 17).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The folder contains another congratulatory letter to Moyse dated February 19 and signed 'H. D. Mitchell for L. H. Bash,' declaring "the Commanding General desires me to express his pleasure at this recognition by the French Army."  Archie S. writes Moyse with news of fellow soldiers who were wounded (February 28).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, the folder contains Special Orders No. 52 from W. D. Connor granting a three-day leave of absence 'with permission to visit Paris' (February 21).  In his letters, Moyse also mentions various news items from Baton Rouge about which Gottlieb had written, including engagements, marriages, and deaths of mutual acquaintances.  In a letter dated February 21, Moyse describes the decoration ceremony during which he received the Croix de Guerre with palm.  The French general [Requichot] "pinned on the cross, struck me on each shoulder with his sword, passed each of his cheeks against each of mine, respectively or reversely.  Then came an American handshake, a few well-chosen words of congratulations and I was the official wearer of the cross."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the same letter, he tells Gottlieb he is going to visit Paris the following day and hopes to see Napoleon's tomb and the Louvre Museum.  He also writes that he has two wishes: to visit the cemetery "where [Captain Bill] Weine is buried and to get back to the 125th [Division]."  The other letters to Gottlieb include a postcard from Paris (February 24) and a letter describing his quick trip there, declaring that "By day and by night, in rain or in fair weather, it just naturally stands out as the most beautiful large city I've seen" (February 27).

Folder 1a-17, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1919 Mar. 2-Mar.31	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Moyse, Simon, 1855-1946; Gottlieb, Rosalie; Sommer, Harriet, 1880-1973; [last name unknown], Isie; Stanard, Olga; Kahn, Stella	1919	15 letters.	en	correspondence	France; Baton Rouge (La.); Tours (France); Neuwied (Germany)	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains fifteen letters from March 1919, eight of which were written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The folder also contains two letters from Simon Moyse to his son Hermann congratulating him for receiving the Croix de Guerre with Palm (March 4 and March 11).  There are also congratulatory letters from two of Moyse's sisters, Harriet Sommer and Stella Kahn (March 9 and circa March 1919, respectively).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The folder also contains a letter from a soldier from Company F named Isie (last name unknown), in which he acknowledges that "it is not proper for an enlisted man to write a personal letter to an officer, but I could not help but write and tell you about the great esteem that I hold for you, and there are many others too" (March 19), as well as a letter from Olga Stanard (March 31).  There is also a letter from Gottlieb to Moyse, in which she tells him how proud she is of him and that she is anxiously awaiting his return home (March 5).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his letters to Gottlieb, Moyse finishes describing his recent trip to Paris (March 2), and writes of various news items from Baton Rouge about which Gottlieb had written him, including a 'marriage epidemic' (March 6) and a Zeta Beta Tau fraternity dance (March 10).  Moyse also mentions several instances in which he ran into old soldier friends whom he had not seen since before he was wounded.  Moyse also writes that he has not yet received official word as to when he will return to the United States but that he hopes to rejoin the 125th Infantry of the 32nd Division before then (March 2).  He later writes that he expects to return home by mid-May 1919 (March 18).

Folder 1a-18, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1919 Apr. 5-May 18	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Deveray, F.; Connor, W. D.; Whitley, F. L.; Wilson, Anthony L.; Benson, [first name unknown]	1919	16 letters.	en; fr	correspondence	Tours (France); Strasbourg (France); Grosbliederstroff (France); Loir-et-Cher (France); Verdun (France); Brest (France); New York (State); Camp Mills (N.Y.); Neufcha?teau (France)	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains sixteen letters from April 5 through May 18, 1919, nine of which were written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The other letters in the folder include a letter from Moyse to his parents Simon and Flora Moyse in which he gives them news about French family members he visited in Lorraine (April 13), a postcard from a Frenchman who writes to congratulate Moyse on the medals he received (April 14), and a handwritten copy that Moyse made of Special Order No. 111 that states that he is "relieved from further duty" at the Services of Supply Headquarters and is to "report to Headquarters, 32nd Division" (April 21), indicating that Moyse was to rejoin the 32nd Division, from which he had been separated since being wounded on July 31, 1918.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The folder also contains a letter from April 23 signed, 'By command of General Pershing, F. L. Whitley, Adjutant General,' in which Whitley writes the "Commander-in-Chief desires me to express his pleasure at this recognition [Moyse's being awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm] by the French Army" and Special Orders No. 49 from the 125th Infantry headquarters stating that Moyse is now assigned to Company F (April 25).  The final items in the folder are two letters dated May 18 to Moyse from a fellow soldier named Benson [first name unknown] in which he thanks Moyse for his kindness and support and recounts his visit to Verdun and the utter devastation he saw there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his letters to Gottlieb, Moyse writes with the "big news" that his request to join the 125th Infantry has been granted (April 5).  He also mentions visiting Strasbourg and his mother's childhood home in Grosbliederstroff, Lorraine (April 14).  After visiting Verdun, Moyse writes that although it was "a city of 60,000 when the war started," it "cannot offer a single building which the Huns did not at least partially demolish," and, in the same letter, mentions going to the cemetery in which his friend Bill Weine is buried (April 17).  Moyse writes from Brest, France, that he is on the first leg of his trip home, signing the letter 'Homeward Bound H' (April 23).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On May 1, Moyse writes his 'last letter from France' for he is to set sail for the United States the following day.  Upon arriving at Camp Mills, New York, Moyse describes his emotions upon seeing the Statue of Liberty from the ship.  Although the soldiers "had been greeted by loud cheering from the land," Moyse writes, "there was something we wanted to see before we would really feel that we had arrived, and it was SHE, that piece of bronze which has spelt America to us for the past several months," seeming to Moyse like the "personification of America calling down a blessing upon the returning men who had faithfully accomplished their mission across the sea" (May 9).  In his final letter in the folder, he writes that he is leaving the following morning for Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg, Mississippi (May 17).

Folder 1a-11, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 Aug. 26-Oct. 17	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Sommer, Lydie, 1903-1981; Sommer, Ray, 1906-1995; Weine, Bill; Bienstock, M.; Author unknown	1918	17 letters.	en	correspondence	France; Loir-et-Cher (France); Blois (France)	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains seventeen letters, dating from August 26 through October 17, 1918.  Fourteen of the letters were written by Hermann Moyse, twelve to Rosalie Gottlieb and two to his brother-in-law and sister, Lep and Harriet Sommer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The folder also contains a letter from a fellow soldier named Bill Weine to Moyse (September 15), and two general orders from October 11, one of which is signed 'By Command of Brigadier General Rosenbaum: M. Bienstock, 1st. Lt. Inf. U.S.A., Adjutant.'  The general orders describe the ceremony scheduled for October 12 at which Moyse received the Distinguished Service Cross for an 'act of extraordinary bravery,' namely, leading a 'patrol of five men forward to capture two machine guns which were endangering success of the operation.  Although seriously wounded in the chest and foot by machine gun fire, he would not consent to being taken to the rear until the guns were taken.' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the letters to Rosalie, Moyse writes that he is making a steady recovery from his battle wounds and is enjoying his stay in a chateau belonging to a wealthy American couple who opened their home to convalescing soldiers.  He also mentions having fought at the Second Battle of the Marne (September 11).  In a letter dated September 15, Moyse praises the resilience of the French people, declaring they are "bound to come out of this war with the greatest credit and the greatest admiration of the entire world, Germany included."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moyse also describes how he was injured in battle and how difficult it is to put into words what combat is like (September 19).  Mentioning that he has been selected to receive the Distinguished Service Cross, Moyse writes, "there are so many acts of bravery in every scrap that it seems just a bit unjust that only he who, thru some chance of fortune comes a bit into the limelight, should be rewarded.  Many a man who lost his life that day undoubtedly earned the Cross far more than I, who as a matter of fact, did only what any American officer would have done" (September 25).  In a letter from October 16, Moyse describes the ceremony on October 12 during which he received the Distinguished Service Cross.

Folder 1a-22, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1919 Aug. 18-Nov. 2	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985	1919	7 letters.	en	correspondence	Baton Rouge (La.)	Louisiana--Social life and customs--20th century	This folder contains seven letters from August 18 through November 2, 1919, written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  Moyse writes with news of mutual acquaintances, including engagements.  He also writes about various dinner parties and other social events he attended.  In a letter dated September 2, Moyse writes to Gottlieb upon returning to Baton Rouge after a two-day trip to visit her in Pass Christian (Miss.), declaring the trip very "enjoyable" albeit too short.  He mentions receiving a letter from Yvonne [last name unknown] who was in Paris for the Bastille Day celebration and wrote that the American soldiers who participated in the parades "evoked a great deal of applause" (August 18).  Moyse also mentions having to go to Livingston and New Roads (La.) for work (November 2).

Folder 1a-20, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1919 July 4-July 15	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985	1919	4 letters.	en	correspondence	Baton Rouge (La.)	Louisiana--Social life and customs--20th century; World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains four letters from July 4 through July 15, 1919, all written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  In a letter dated July 4, Moyse reminisces about the previous year's Fourth of July celebration in a French town named Massevaux during which the "Alsatian girls, ranging from tots to young mademoiselles in their teens, all dressed in the national costume, sang a verse of the Star Spangled Banner in English, [which] was so clearly an effort to please 'les Amricains,' to symbolize the unity that existed between the nations that I doubt whether there was an auditor who did not leave feeling more closely our friendly relations." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Moyse also writes about attending various luncheons and dinners at which he was asked to give a speech or which he attended as the guest of honor and describes his participation in an event at the Louisiana state penitentiary (July 4, July 7).  In a letter from July 11, Moyse mentions receiving a letter from Mrs. Abbott, one of his hosts at the château in France where he was convalescing after having been wounded.  In the final letter in the folder, Moyse describes the dinner he attended in honor of Bastille Day at which he gave a speech in French, jokingly noting "All I can say is that I lived through it last night and that none of my auditors threw any rotten eggs or cabbages" (July 15).

Folder 1a-19, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1919 June 22-July 3	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Bordeaux, C. J.	1919	4 letters.	en; fr	correspondence	Baton Rouge (La.); France	Law firms--Louisiana--Baton Rouge; Louisiana--Social life and customs--20th century; World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains four letters from June 22 through July 3, 1919, three of which are from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  Moyse returned to Baton Rouge and writes to Gottlieb about various work-related trips to New Roads, Livingston, and New Orleans, Louisiana.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a letter dated June 30, he mentions that he will be formally joining the law firm of Cross & Moyse the following day.  In the same letter, he writes that he has received various invitations to speak about his war experience and has accepted one such invitation at the state penitentiary, provided there is no mention of it in the press, for he decided he has "already had too much press-agenting."  The fourth letter in the folder is from a fellow soldier named C. J. Bordeaux.  Still stationed in France, Bordeaux writes to Moyse to update him on news of mutual acquaintances (July 3).

Folder 1a-06, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1918 Jan. 9-Mar. 18	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Charmais, M.	1918	8 letters.	en; fr	correspondence	New York (N.Y.); Atlantic Ocean; Blois (France); Loir-et-Cher (France); France	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains eight letters from January 9 through March 18, five of which Hermann Moyse wrote to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The folder also contains a telegram dated January 20, from Moyse to his brother-in-law Lep Sommer, announcing Moyse's safe arrival in France, a letter from Moyse to his parents Simon and Flora Moyse, and a letter from a Frenchman to Simon and Flora Moyse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the letters, Moyse writes of his brief stay in New York shortly before his deployment to France, of his trip across the Atlantic Ocean, of his favorable first impressions of France, praising the country's natural beauty and the friendliness of its people, and, in a letter to Gottlieb dated March 12, of his first visit to Paris ("[N]othing I have ever read or heard about Paris from its beauty on down, inclusive, was exaggerated").  Moyse notes in the same letter that "it is the ninth wonder of the world to the French how lively and gay the Americans are and how rapidly and efficiently we work."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A letter written in French and dated March 3 is from a man named M. Charmais in the town of Disly-Loir-et-Cher who informs Moyse's parents that he has had the pleasure of meeting their son, and, as someone with a son and son-in-law at war, would like to compliment the Moyses on raising such a 'good and sweet son.'

Folder 1a-15, Hermann Moyse, Sr. Letters, 1919 Jan. 1-Jan. 28	Moyse, Hermann, 1891-1985; Stevens, Levi; Weine, Paul; Wilson, Guy M.	1919	11 letters.	en	correspondence	Tours (France); Neuwied (Germany); Alpena (Mich.); France	World War, 1914-1918	This folder contains eleven letters dating from January 1 through January 28, 1919, seven of which were written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The four other items in the folder are letters to Moyse, three from fellow soldiers Levi Stevens and Guy M. Wilson (the folder contains both the original handwritten letter from Wilson and a typed copy), and one letter from Moyses deceased friend Bill Weines father, Paul Weine.  Stevens writes Moyse with news of various casualties and wounds among the soldiers from their company, calling Captain Bill Weine the most fearless man he ever knew (January 5).  Wilson praises Moyse for his bravery and leadership, writing that Moyse has missed the real joy of life in hearing the men tell how fearless you were and how calmly you acted after you were hit (January 28).  Paul Weine thanks Moyse for his sincere letter of condolence upon Bills death (January 6).  In the letters to Gottlieb, Moyse shares some of his combat experiences, and describes various evenings of entertainment, including attending concerts, variety shows, and, in a letter dated January 9, a Charlie Chaplin movie.  He also mentions running into various soldier friends with whom he had not had contact since before he was wounded (January 27).  In the same letter, he describes a particular incident of bravery he heard about that occurred on February 5, 1918: the ship Tuscania was torpedoed and sinking and the commanding officer turned to the men and reminded them that they were Americans and that their duty toward their country, if their fate was to die, was to die like Americans with a smile upon their lips and without fear.  His words and his example held the men at attention so that when a rescuing British destroyer finally came along they marched in perfect order off the doomed ship to safety without a single loss.  Moyse notes that the story is one of cool-headed bravery on the part of every member of the platoon, the kind that really saves mens lives.
