Charles L. Franck and Franck-Bertacci	Charles L. Franck was a commercial photographer in New Orleans whose individual career and successors covered all but the first decade of the 20th century.  In 1955, his studio was purchased by Albert Bertacci, who continued to operate within the same scope of assignments as Franck had done. Tens of thousands of photographs and negatives from the Franck and Franck – Bertacci studios, held at The Collection, chronicle the face and growth of Louisiana, and New Orleans in particular, during the 20th century.  The change of the city through its photographed character focuses on major industries (the port, construction, transportation) during a period of racial integration, labor disputes and urban growth. Social and cultural events – Mardi Gras, weddings, private parties all feature in the collection as well. As the Franck Collection approaches the present day, the photographs of major building projects (the Louisiana Superdome, bridges across the Mississippi River, nuclear power plants and petrochemical complexes) touch on issues of suburban and exurban expansion, and environmental issues.

Lafcadio Hearn Correspondence	Lafcadio Hearn was a writer during the closing decades of the nineteenth century  and the opening years of the twentieth. His writings--fiction and nonfiction  alike--typically drew on his firsthand observations of life in what were then  considered exotic places: New Orleans, the West Indies, and Japan. The Lafcadio Hearn  Collection at Loyola University New Orleans consists primarily of letters written by  Hearn to Page Baker. Baker was the editor of the Times-Democrat when Hearn worked for  that newspaper; he was also a steadfast champion of Hearn's literary ambitions. Hearn  wrote Baker from various places--New Orleans, the West Indies, and Japan. In these  letters, which ranged from one paragraph to many pages, Hearn touched on many  subjects, including his work at the Times-Democrat, his literary efforts, and his  travels.

Alfred and William Waud Collection	The London-born Wauds' specialty was producing drawings--from quick sketches to finished works--of   places, people, and events assigned to them by editors. These drawings were the basis for wood engraved illustrations   in the periodicals published by their employers. Alfred Waud was hired by the New York Illustrated News in 1860 and he   remained with the News for nearly two years covering the opening months of the Civil War before joining the staff of   Harper's Weekly in early 1862. William Waud worked as a special artist during the Civil War for Frank Leslie's Illustrated   Newspaper. The Waud Collection presents a visually fascinating history of America in the mid-19th century, covering   visually subjects as diverse as the reconstructed South, and the townships that dotted both banks of the nation's largest   river system.

Carnival Collection	Tulane University's Louisiana Research Collection (LaRC) preserves possibly the largest collection of New Orleans Carnival paper and ephemera, such as invitations, dance cards, call out cards, printed float plates and bulletins, and original float and costume designs.    Perhaps most notable among our Carnival collection are the more than five thousand original designs for Carnival floats and costumes we preserve. Many of these are from the "Golden Age" of Carnival and feature the work of noted designers such as Jennie  Wilde, B. A. Wikstrom, and Charles Briton. LaRC also preserves the works of more contemporary designers, including Patricia Hardin, Olga Peters, and designer and  noted Carnival historian Henri Schindler.

Gulf South Decorative and Fine Arts Database	The Classical Institute of the South is dedicated to identifying and documenting fine and decorative art objects in the Gulf South and making that information available to all.  We believe that objects are dynamic, provocative, and vital to understanding the past. Since the first Gulf South Field Survey in 2011, fellows and staff of the Classical Institute of the South have cataloged over 1,000 objects in private collections dating from the 18th century through the Civil War. The survey spans Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and we are continually expanding our reach throughout the region. As cataloging efforts continue, new information and images will be added to this database in order to draw attention to the objects and to the research possibilities that they present.
