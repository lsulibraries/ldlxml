Chatsworth Plantation Store Records Series I Ledgers Accounts Receipts Box 01 Folder 01				1865-1893	33	Gardere, Francois, 1792-1871.; Gardere, Fergus, 1817-1894.; Staring, Joseph, b. 1860.; P. Maspero and Co.; Plantations--Louisiana.; Stores--Louisiana.; Chatsworth Plantation (La.)			The papers relate to the operation of the store and plantation at Chatsworth, and to the Gardere and Staring families. The bulk of the material consists of store ledgers, which record accounts and laborers' payrolls. There is also material from a plantation journal in French and English, possibly written in part by Fergus Gardere. Miscellaneous material includes legal and business papers of Joseph Staring and letters to Fergus Gardere.	Chatsworth plantation was bought by the Gardere family in 1866, and managed by Fergus Gardere until 1895. Gardere operated a cotton gin in partnership with Joseph Staring in the 1880s. Staring bought Chatsworth in 1920 and managed it until his death.	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries. Copyright is retained in accordance with U.
