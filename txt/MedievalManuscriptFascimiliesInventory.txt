Biblia judía		14th century?	Before 1506	Spain	A Hebrew Bible	Ornamentation and calligraphic medallions	Spanish-style Hebrew lettering	Unknown	Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo del Escorial, Spain (http://rbme.patrimonionacional.es/ )	A fine example of a Mudejar (Spanish Muslim) binding, this manuscript also features fine filigree ornamentation and calligraphic medallions.  The codex was used by the Spanish Rabbi Alfonso de Zamora, one of three Jewish scholars who worked under the patronage of Cardinal Franco Jimenez de Cisneros on the production of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible and who converted to Christianity in 1506.   Alfonso wrote in the top margins of all the folios, in his own hand, the Latin names of the books of the Bible and the corresponding chapter numbers.  In the side margins he inserted the chapter divisions which appear in the Polyglot Bible.  At a later date, he removed the titles and numbers in the margin, replacing the former by the original Hebrew names and the latter by rabbinico-alphabetical numbers.     Apart from some differences in pointing, this manuscript coincides with the Textus Receptus, comprising the whole of the Palestinian canon, with the exception of Genesis 38.24-42 and 16, for which the folios have been lost.

El libro del ajedrez dados et tablas		13th century	before 1284	Spain	A treatise on chess, dice, and other games	Illuminated, with 150 full- and half-page illustrations of games	Gothic	Unknown	Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo del Escorial, Spain (http://rbme.patrimonionacional.es/ )	Written on parchment, this manuscript consists of 200 leaves, illustrated in color and with gold leaf.  The 150 miniatures depict both men and women (veiled and unveiled) playing chess, dice, and backgammon.  The text documents the introduction of chess into Europe and was probably translated from an Arabic treatise, demonstrating the continuing impact of Arab culture on the Christian ruling classes of northern Spain.    The companion volume includes a complete transcription of the text and suggests that in addition to offering instruction in the game of chess, the treatise may also be regarded as hermetic literature, transmitting knowledge of the Far East.

The poem Theriaka concerns the bites of poisonous insects, snakes and wild animals; Alexipharmaka, concerns other poisons of plant and mineral origin and contains information on precautions and antidotes.     Theriaka is divided into three sections:  descriptions of poisonous animals, symptoms of their bites and stings, and remedies for poisoning.  Alexipharmaka, also in three parts, deals with poisonous solutions, symptoms, and remedies.     This is the only extant illustrated example of Nicander’s work.  Forty of the forty-eight folios in the codex feature miniatures illustrating the text.

Its 300 pieces represent nearly all of the most renowned composers of the fourteenth century.    The codex is richly illuminated with gold and pigment. The miniatures and illuminations originated in the Florentine scriptorium of Santa Maria degli Angeli between 1410 and 1415. An inscription states that the codex once belonged to the Florentine organist Antonio Squarcialupi (1417-1480). It was later owned by Giuliano de’ Medici and subsequently passed to the Palatine Library; at the end of the eighteenth century it was transferred together with other volumes to the Laurentian Library.

Vergilius Vaticanus		5th century	ca. 400	Rome	Virgil’s Aeneid and Georgics	50 illustrations	Rustic capitals	Scribe unknown; at least three different unidentified artists	Biblioteca Apostolica, Vatican, Cod. Vat. Lat. 3225 (https://www.vatlib.it/home.php )	The Vergilius Vaticanus is the best preserved example of a book illustrated in the Greco-Roman tradition and constitutes one of the oldest sources of Virgil’s Aeneid.  Produced in Rome around 400 A.D., it is also the oldest of the three surviving classical manuscripts containing illustrations of classical literature (the others being the Vergilius Romanus and the Ambrosian Iliad).     The text is interspersed with 50 miniatures, the color illustrations of which exhibit parallels to Greek-influenced wall paintings at Pompeii. Only 76 leaves of the manuscript survive, containing fragments of Virgil’s Georgics in addition to the Aeneid.    If it contained all of Virgil’s works, the manuscript originally would have had about 440 leaves and 280 illustrations. The text was written by a single scribe in rustic capitals with no separation between words. The illustrations are bordered by ornate golden frames and include landscapes and architectural details.     The manuscript was probably made for a pagan noble. Annotations indicate it was in Italy until the 7th century and in Tours in the second quarter of the 9th century. A French scribe made further notes around 1400.

The Canterbury Tales: The New Ellesmere Chaucer Facsimile		15th century	ca. 1400	England	Fictional account of a pilgrimage to Canterbury, in prose and verse	Floriated borders; miniature portraits of storytellers	Bastard secretary	Unknown	Huntington Library, San Marino, California (http://www.huntington.org/ )	This manuscript, known as the Ellesmere Chaucer, was probably produced soon after 1400. It contains 240 parchment leaves, 232 of which are the text of the Canterbury Tales. The remaining eight leaves were originally blank, lined pages that now contain early miscellaneous notes. The text was written by one scribe in an English cursive script.     Probably made and bound in London, the manuscript measures 16 by 11 inches and is elegantly decorated. Seventy-one pages contain floriated borders, and most pages bear gold leaf.  Portraits of storytellers are also of interest.  The best known decorative feature of the Ellesmere manuscript is a set of twenty-three equestrian portraits of the storytellers (including Chaucer) who tell their tales during a sixty-mile pilgrimage from London to the Shrine of St. Thomas à Becket in Canterbury Cathedral.     Although it is not certain who commissioned the manuscript, Chaucer’s son Thomas may have been responsible. Some time after completion, it passed into the hands of Thomas de Vere, twelfth earl of Oxford, and eventually to Sir Thomas Egerton, who, under James I, became Baron Ellesmere.    Rebound in 1802, the manuscript was first made available to scholars in 1846, although it remained at Bridgewater House, the Edgerton family estate.  Henry E.

Codex Aureus		8th century	ca. 750-800	Southern England, possibly Canterbury	New Testament Gospels	Originally contained four portraits of the evangelists (only Matthew and John survive); illuminated capitals; Canon Tables contain numerous roundels with religious figures.	Uncial	Unknown	Royal Library, Stockholm, Sweden (http://www.kb.se/english/ )	The portrait pages exhibit both Byzantine/Italian and Celtics styles, while the Canon Tables are primarily Celtic in design.  Overall, the manuscript’s styles is similar to that of the Vespasian Psalter, although its use of gold, unusual in other British manuscripts of this period, makes it stand out.  Half of the pages have been dyed purple, with text in gold, silver and white; on the plain vellum pages, the text is in black, red and gold.  Other colors found are red, blue, yellow, green and brown.      The Codex Aureus has travelled widely. In the ninth century it was stolen by the Vikings and ransomed by Ealdorman Aelfred, who then donated it to Christ Church, Canterbury. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was in Spain, and in 1690 it was bought for the Swedish royal collection in Stockholm and returned to Scandinavia.

Libro de los medicamentos simples		15th century	ca. 1470	France	Text of De medicinis simplicibus	386 full-page illustrations	French bastarde; scolia in italic	Robinet Testard?	National Library of Russia (ms. Fr. F.v.vi.1) (http://www.nlr.ru/eng/ )	Mattheus Platearius’s well-known and lavishly decorated medical treatise is made up of 328 pages, containing 118 whole-page miniatures and 2 quarter-page miniatures. The work, originally written in the mid 12th century, is a compendium of classical knowledge related to the use of animal, vegetable and mineral substances to cure or relieve disease.     The text is divided into five parts: herbs and flowers, trees and their gums and resins, metals and minerals, animal products, and other materials.  It is followed by 386 full-page illustrations. In addition to the core text, in French, are chapters from works of later periods, during which knowledge of medicine increased.     Of interest are annotations by 16th-century physicians, voicing their distaste for some of the vernacular terms in the codex, and replacing them with Greek and Latin words.  The manuscript is also interesting for its depiction of plants in diagrammatic (typical of the Middle Ages) as well as realistic styles (foreshadowing the Renaissance).					French		Barcelona: M.

Beato de San Millán		10th/11th century	ca. 1000	Rioja, Spain	Commentary on the Apocalypse	48 miniatures	Uncial	Scriptorium of Rioja monastery	Library of the Royal Academy of History, Madrid, Spain (http://www.rah.es/ )	The codex was written in two phases.  The first hand can be dated late 10th or early 11th century, and, along with the quality of the parchment, is evidence of a lack of material resources resulting from Al Mansur’s campaigns against Rioja at the time of the manuscript’s production; one of his last raids destroyed San Millán Monastery.  The manuscript was completed in the second half of the 11th century, when the great Riojan monastery was enjoying economic prosperity; this was done by a number of hands, less skillful than the first, and showing clear Carolingian influence.  The blank spaces left by the first copyist were filled with 48 miniatures, exhibiting two different techniques:  Mozarabic (to folio 92) and Romanesque.  The portion written in the late 11th century contains only one miniature.     According to a note on folio 58, the codex was copied by Albinus in the time of Benitus, the eighth abbot of the monastery, in the year 670; it is now known, however, that this is a 17th-c					Latin		Madrid: Testimonio Compañía Editorial, 2002	1 v.

The Kaufmann Haggadah		14th century	14th century	Spain	An illuminated Haggadah	14 miniatures, with decorated text		Unknown	Oriental Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary (Ms 422 of the Kaufmann Collection) (http://www.mtak.hu/index_en.php )	One of the finest examples of an illuminated Haggadah, the Kaufmann Haggadah is composed of 2 parts: 14 full page miniatures, and a decorated text. The episodes depicted in the miniatures recapitulate the Exodus story beginning with the discovery of the infant Moses in the Nile and ending with Miriam's song by the Red Sea. Also included is a miniature of preparations for Passover. The text decorations are elaborate, and in addition to the conventional representations of the rabbis in Bene Brak, the four sons, matzah and bitter herbs, they include biblical episodes already depicted in the full-page miniatures. Three artists may have collaborated on the illustrations. Unfortunately, the miniatures were rearranged at some point in the volume's transmission and are now out of order.

Martirologio de Usuardo	Usuard, d. 876 or 7	15th century	ca. 1400	Prague	A history of martyrs	Lavishly illustrated with decorative capitals; 3-6 roundels per page, featuring Biblical figures	Gothic	Unknown	Museu d'Art, Girona, Spain (http://www.museuart.com/eng/index.html )	From 841 to 847, Usuard was a monk at Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. His journey through Spain in 858 led to the incorporation of Spanish saints into his work on martyrs, which remained throughout the Middle Ages the most famous document of its kind and is preserved in numerous later manuscripts, such as this one.      Originating in Prague at the court of Wenceslas IV, this 15th-century copy of Usuard’s Martyrology plays a key role in the history of Central-European painting, constituting a high point in the evolution of the Bohemian tradition of book illumination.

Containing 334 polyphonic and monophonic entries, the manuscript is the sole source dateable into the early fifteenth century devoted exclusively to French (or at least French-derived) music.  The range and origins of its repertory, combining plainchant for the Office and the Mass with polyphonic settings of the Mass Ordinary, motets, and a vast collection of French songs in the formes fixes, all apparently composed for the royal court of Cyprus, make the manuscript unique among codices of late medieval music.  Moreover, a Mass cycle copied in the back of the manuscript as a later addition offers rare musical evidence from a period that witness the genesis of one of the central genres of Western art music.

Libro del caballero Zifar	Unknown	15th century	1464	Spain	A Spanish medieval romance	242 illuminated miniatures	Gothic	Juan de Carrion (?), illustrator	Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, France (Espagnol 36) (http://www.bnf.fr/en/tools/a.welcome_to_the_bnf.html )	The Libro del caballero Zifar is the first extensive adventure story to have been written in Spanish and was composed around 1300. It retains traces of the chivalric romances of the Middle Ages and was probably written by Ferrand Martinez, cleric of Toledo, who appears in the prologue.     Two manuscripts of the story have survived, one from the 14th century (MS 11,309, National Library of Madrid) and one dated 1464 (MS Espagnol 36, Bibliothèque Nationale).  There are also two copies of an edition printed in Seville in 1512.     The story is divided into three parts.  The first recounts the experiences of the knight Zifar and his family after they are forced to abandon their home.  In the second part, Zifar instructs his sons in the art of kingship.  The third section tells the story of Roboán, Zifar’s son, who has set out on his own quest.

Apocalipsis	Beatus, Saint, Presbyter of Liebana, d. 798	10th century	ca. 950	Monastery of San Miguel de Escalada, Spain	Commentary on the Book of Revelation	Full- and half-page paintings of religious figures and allegory; Maps	Uncial	Maius	Morgan Library and Museum, New York, New York (http://www.themorgan.org/&gt;	This manuscript, known as the Morgan Beatus, was apparently produced at the monastery of San Miguel de Escalada by Maius (or Magius), fl. 926-968.  It is the oldest example of a revived Spanish apocalypse tradition.  The illuminations reflect a stylistic and cultural revolution taking place in the newly reclaimed territories of the Iberian peninsula.  Of note are the brilliantly painted portraits of the Evangelists.     The Apocalypse and commentary by Saint Beatus of Liébana became one of the most important religious texts of the Middle Ages, and was often fully illustrated.  The Morgan Beatus contains preliminary material with brilliantly painted Evangelist portraits (f. 1-9), Beatus's Commentary on the Apocalypse, (f.10-233), excerpts from Isidore of Seville's De ad finitatibus et gradibus and of his Etymologies (f.234r-237r), St. Jerome's Commentary on Daniel, (f. 239-293), and a third exposition of the Apocalypse (f.294-299).

Carmina Burana		13th century	ca. 1230	Bavaria	Anthology of secular music	Large decorative capitals in red; several full- and half-page illustrations of religious subjects	Gothic	Unknown	Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich (https://www.bsb-muenchen.de/index.php )	The title "Carmina Burana" literally means “songs of Beuren” and was given by Johann Andreas Schmeller to his complete edition (1847) of the poems contained in an early 13th-century German manuscript (discovered in 1803) from the Benedictine abbey of Benediktbeuern, south of Munich.  Since then, the manuscript has been known by that title even though it is now generally agreed that it probably did not originate in Benediktbeuern and may have come from Seckau. The manuscript is perhaps the most important source for Latin secular poetry of the 12th-century goliardic repertory. There are some poems in German, and several of the poems have music written in unheighted neumes, a relatively rare style of notation at the time. In total, the manuscript contains approximately 250 poems.    The pieces, mostly in Latin, with a few in a dialect of Middle High German and Old French, were written by students and clergy around 1230. Most of the poems and songs appear to be the work of Goliards, clergy (mostly students) who lampooned and satirized the Church. The collection preserves the works of a number of poets, including Peter of Blois, Walter of Châtillon, and an anonymous poet referred to as the Archpoet.

Comentario al Apocalipsis	Saint Beatus, Presbyter of Liebana, d. 798.	10th century	975	Spain	Commentary on the Apocalypse	131 miniatures with over 1,200 motifs of Visigothic-Preromanic art	Caroline minuscule	Unknown	Gerona Cathedral, Gerona, Spain (http://www.catedraldegirona.org/ )	In 776 Beatus, a staunchly orthodox monk from the monastery of San Martín de Turieno in Liébana in northern Spain, assembled a commentary on the Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. Lavishly illustrated and known today as the Beatus manuscripts, the copies of this text made by medieval scribes and illuminators hold a singular place in the history of medieval illumination. Ranging in date from around 885 to around 1240, the surviving Beatus manuscripts and fragments comprise over fifteen hundred individual illuminations.  Vol. 2 contains H.A. Sanders' 1930 transcription of the Latin text, and commentaries on Beatus' work.

Codice Albeldense	Various	10th century	976	Monastery of St. Martin at Albelda (Rioja, Spain)	Commentary on canon and civil law; Life of Mahomet; calendar with early depiction of Arabic numerals.	82 miniatures; Mozarabic Visigothic style, but with Carolingian-influenced miniatures	Visigothic	Vigila; illuminators: Sarracino and García	Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo del Escorial (http://rbme.patrimonionacional.es/ )	Produced for the Monastery of St. Martin at Albelda (Rioja), the manuscript comprises 429 large folios written in double columns.  All three of the illuminators are pictured in one of the miniatures.    The Albelda codex is a compendium of canon and civil law. The main corpus comprises complete accounts of all the general councils, to which were added a selection of canons and decrees by popes up to St. Gregory the Great (540 - 604 AD). It also contains the Fuero Juzgo, the civil code used in Spain from the Gothic period up to the 13th century.     The work was enriched by the addition of historical and liturgical texts such as the Life of Mahomet, as well as the Albelda Short Chronicle or Calendar, in which we find the first mention and drawing in Europe of the Arabic numerals 1-9.     The 82 colored miniatures provide views of towns and portraits of famous persons. Although a Hispanic work, the influence of Carolingian miniatures in the illustrations is evident.

Ashburnham Pentateuch		6th century	exact date unknown	possibly northern Spain or Rome	First four books of the Old Testament	18 miniatures	Uncial	Unknown	Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Ms. NAL 2334 (http://www.bnf.fr/en/tools/a.welcome_to_the_bnf.html )	This work contains 18 miniatures out of an estimated original total of 69, which are distributed irregularly through the first four books of the Old Testament. No part of Deuteronomy has survived. Most of the illustrations occupy a full page and are often subdivided into separate scenes. There are numerous inscriptions within the images.     The style resembles 6th-century Italian work; a Spanish origin has also been suggested. The manuscript was at Tours in the Middle Ages, where it was consulted for the frontispiece cycles of Carolingian Bibles.  In the 11th century it was used to help decorate the nearby church of St. Julien.

Biblia de San Luis		13th century	1226-1234	Paris, France	The Bible	4887 roundels	Gothic	Unidentified	Toledo Cathedral, Spain (http://www.catedralprimada.es/biblioteca_capitular_toledo/ )	A richly illustrated “Moralized Bible,” in Latin. The earliest references to this work are the codicil and testament of Alfonso X the Wise, king of Castile, describing it as a "historiated Bible in three books given to us by the king of France" and "one of the most noble items belonging to the king."  Created between 1226 and 1234, this codex is famous for its almost 5000 medallions, depicting scenes from the Bible.      The three-volume manuscript was probably commissioned by Blanche of Castile, regent of France, and given to her son Louis IX to commemorate his marriage to Marguerite of Provence in 1234. Louis in turn gave it to Alfonso of Castile, either on the occasion of the contract of marriage in 1255 between Louis’s eldest son, Louis, and Alfonso’s daughter Berenguela or in connection with the marriage, negotiated in 1266 and celebrated in 1269, of Louis’s daughter Blanche to Alfonso’s son Fernando.

Coran de Muley Zaydan		16th century	1599	Morocco	An illuminated Qur’an	None	Kufic	Unknown	Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo del Escorial, Spain (http://rbme.patrimonionacional.es/ )	This sixteenth-century Koran was "executed in the Mosque of the Al-Badi Palace in Marrakech, and finished on the 13th day of the month of Rab'ia in the year 1008 after the Hegira [2nd November 1599], during the reign of Sultan Al-Mansur, father of Muley Zaydan" (from Folio 264).  Written on paper, it was transported to Spain after the victory of Pedro de Para in the Barbary Sea in 1611. Richly decorated throughout, it is an outstanding example of mabsut style, with vocalization in red, tasdid and sukuns in blue. The titles of the suras are written in gold Kufic script on a blue ground. Folios 1v, 2r, 264v and 265v are illuminated with Moorish motifs.    The facsimile faithfully reproduces the original, including the gilt work and quality of the paper, which is, like the original, a laid paper.

Gr. 1) (http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/index.php )	This is the earliest known illustrated herbal and contains the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides Pedanius, written ca. 60 AD.  The work is a treatise on the medicinal value of herbs.  Also included are illustrations of various animals and birds.      The manuscript was made for Anicia Juliana, a noblewoman of Constantinople, whose father was briefly emperor.  It remained in Constantinople (where it may have been used by Hamon, the Jewish doctor of sultan Suleiman II) until about 1570, when it was purchased by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II.  The artist is unknown, but the plant drawings resemble those of the early botanical illustrator Krateaus.					Greek, Latin, Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew, French		Graz, Akademische Druck- u.

Apocalipsis Gulbenkian		13th century	ca. 1265-1270	Probably London	Commentary on the Apocalypse	152 miniatures	Gothic		Gulbenkian Foundation Museum, Lisbon, Portugal (http://museu.gulbenkian.pt/Museu/en/Homepage )	The text describes in allegorical language the struggles between good and evil, the persecution of the Church and its members, the temptations of the Devil and the tyrannical rule of the Antichrist.  Evil creatures, including the Dragon, the Beast and their followers fight against St. Michael and the Angels, the Woman in the Sun, and the Army of Heaven.  Good triumphs over evil and the text ends in the establishment of the Heavenly Jerusalem and the appearance of Christ to St. John.      In 13th-century England, picture books of the Apocalypse became one of the most popular forms of luxury illuminated books.  As texts for elaborate illustration and decoration, only Psalters outnumber the Apocalypses.   					Latin		Barcelona: M.

Codex Calixtinus		12th century	ca. 1150-60	Spain	Guide for pilgrims	paintings of St. James and other figures; Decorated initials	Gothic	Unknown	Archivo de la Catedral de Santiago de Compostela, Spain (http://www.catedraldesantiago.es/es/archivo-biblioteca )	Also known as the Liber Sancti Jacobi, this manuscript is a guidebook for pilgrims traveling to the shrine of the apostle St. James in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.  The text was long thought to have been written by Pope Callixtus II, but scholars now believe that it is the work of Callixtus’s secretary, the French scholar Aymeric Picaud.      The Codex Callixtinus is divided into five sections.  The first contains sermons, liturgical texts and homilies for the liturgy of St. James.  The second recounts miracles attributed to the him.  This is followed by a history of the transfer of St. James’s body from Jerusalem to Galicia.  The fourth book, which was reincorporated into the manuscript in 1964 after being removed from the codex in the seventeenth century, is a history of Charlemagne’s failed attempt in the eighth century to liberate Spain and the tomb of St. James from the Moors; it also contains an account of the death of the knight Roland at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778.  The fifth and final book contains practical advice for pilgrims traveling to Santiago de Compostela.  This manuscript is also an important source of medieval polyphonic music and contains the earliest known composition for three voices.

The North French Hebrew Miscellany		13th century	ca. 1278	France		49 full-page illustrations of stories from the Bible and Haggadah	Hebrew	Benjamin the Scribe	British Library Add. Ms. 11639 (http://www.bl.uk/ )	The North French Hebrew Miscellany comprises 84 different groups of texts, including poems, legal codes, and material related to marriage, divorce, rituals, and business transactions.  Among other texts included are the Pentateuch, Haftarot, Pirkei Avot, the Mezuzah, the Book of Tobit, and Isaac de Corbeil’s Sefer Mitsvot Katan.  The miscellany is an important source of sacred Hebrew poetry.  Most of the poems fall into the category of Yotseroth, cycles of poems related to the morning prayer service.  Other categories include Sabbath table-songs, petitions for forgiveness, and songs for the Jewish festival of Sukkoth.    This is a fine and rare example of Ashkenazi Hebrew manuscript illumination, and  it contains several dozen full-page illustrations of biblical scenes and figures, including Aaron, David, Moses, Abraham, Judith, David and Goliath, the Tree of Life, the Tabernacle, Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace, the Nine Spheres, and the Judgment of Solomon.

Cantigas de Santa María		13th century	13th century	Spain	Collections of monophonic (solo) songs	Full-page illuminations of biblical scenes; Decorated initials	Gothic	At court of Alfonso X	Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence, Ms. B.R. 20 (http://www.bncf.firenze.sbn.it/ )	This manuscript was produced at the court of Alfonso X "El Sabio" (1221-1284), king of Castile.  The songs (cantigas) are written in Galician-Portuguese, the language of the Spanish troubadours.   In total, 420 “songs to the Virgin Mary” were written at the Castilian court, of which this manuscript contains 109.  It has been suggested that King Alfonso himself may have authored many of them.    Three manuscripts of the Cantigas have survived.  This is the so-called Florence codex.  The work was never completed, and although it contains music staves, there are no notes.  Many of the illustrations are also incomplete.  Depict scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, some illustrations are of an erotic nature, reflecting the troubadour emphasis on divine and courtly love.

According to the author, health is based on six factors:  climate, food and drink, movement and rest, sleep and wakefulness, happiness, pain and sadness.  Illness and disease result these factors become imbalanced.    The therapeutic properties of various foods, plants, and animal products are described, and basic rules of hygiene are laid out.  In addition to plants, the manuscript’s 208-illustrations also depict a variety of scenes from daily life in the Middle Ages, including cooking, wine making, harvesting, horse riding, hunting, fencing, dancing, and sex.

Atlas de Historia Natural		16th century	ca. 1590	Spain	Illustrations of European and American flora and fauna	218 pages of illustrations of plants and animals	Italic	Unknown Italian artists at the court of Phillip II	Valencia University Library, Valencia, Spain (http://www.uv.es/uvweb/libraries-documentation-service/en/libraries-documentation-service-1285867215074.html )	Also known as the Pomar Codex, this manuscript was given to Jaime Honorato Pomar, professor of botany at the University of Valencia, by King Philip II of Spain.  The work incorporates many of the discoveries of the physician and naturalist Francisco Hernández (1517-1587), leader of a scientific expedition to Mexico in the 1570s.  Some of the illustrations appear to have been copied from Hernández’s drawings; others may have been drawn from life at the royal botanical gardens at Aranjuez.    The codex contains illustrations of seven animals and twenty-five plants of American origin, including the armadillo, tobacco, bananas, tomatoes, the Indian coconut, and the bird of paradise.  Most of the European plants are medicinal in nature, although there are a few images of decorative plants, including the tulip and narcissus.
