Dog with driftwood	1944	Driftwood.  Here, vividly portrayed, is the way the Gulf of Mexico and Ol' Man River (especially following a period of high water) piles up driftwood on the beach at Grand Isle.  This driftwood is thriftily used by the islanders for fuel, for fences and other purposes.  The natives of Grand Isle have a unique system of salvage rights.  Since the driftwood is indiscriminately tossed onto the beach, any islander who wishes a particular piece of driftwood merely cuts his initials in it, thereby identifying it as his until such time as he removes it from the beach.  For many decades the islanders have meticulously observed this custom and no islander would even contemplate removing a piece of driftwood that was already initialed.

The smaller pair are luggers that operate in the lakes, bays and shallow gulf water.  The large lugger in the background will cruise out fifty miles in the Gulf of Mexico, pursuing the jumbo shrimp.

Elevated house	1945	This is the old home of Levy Collins at Golden Meadow.  How it happens to be here when it was originally built at Leeville is one of Lafourche's tall but true tales.  When the storm of 1915 hit the Gulf area, Levy Collins' home at Leeville (this one) was torn loose from its foundation and disappeared, riding the flood waters.  It floated for about 9 miles and when it had stopped in Golden Meadon, he simply bought the land and settled there himself.  So much easier than trying to take the house back to Leeville.

Hunting camp in Plaquemines Parish, LA	1947	Way down in Plaquemines Parish years ago was a 66,000 acre Sportsman's Paradise- privately owned by a wealthy Chicagoan name Joseph Leiter.  His Chateau Canard (Duck Castle), built in the middle of this huge water wilderness near the mouth of the Mississippi, where the flights of blue geese, wild duck and snipe often darkened the sun, and where deer abounded, was the most famous hunting lodge in the nation.  So luxurious were the accommodations tendered by Leiter to his guests that it is said even the duck blinds were heated.  Finally this fabulous Hunters' Heaven- known as Pass-a-Loutre- was purchased by the government and was made available to every nimrod in the land, for a small daily license fee.  During the war it was closed for security reasons- but it is happy hunting ground again- and here is shown the Pass-a-Loutre public hunting club where several hundred rod-and-gun men had reservations last year for the entire season.

He and the thousands of others who comprise the bulk of the census of this rich river-land, may not be Emily Posted or hep to the Book-of-the-Month Club, but they will continue to wrest a comfortable living from the waters and soil of their parish long after the students of psychology and philosophy have become public charges.

The muskrat plots shown in the photograph are 47x100 feet, approximately one tenth of an acre in area each.  A walk is built over them so the observer can make notes on the habits of the muskrats without trampling on their runways or otherwise disturbing them.  The one inch mesh wire fence is two feet underground, three feet above the surfaec and with a one-foot overhang to keep the inhabitants in the plots.  One-inch mesh wire, galvanized after weaving, has proved better than wire galvanized before weaving.		TIF	Louisiana Department of Conservation.

Crabbing, Manchac, LA		In the Manchac area a vast majority of the hard shells are taken by crab nets.  The crab fisherman guides his boat along his line of crab nets by means of a tiller in the front of the boat.  Following the series from top to bottom you see him bend over to grab the cork float, lift the net from the water, dump the crabs, and toss the net back overboard- never stopping the boat.

Crabbing with bush lines		Bush lines are used to collect crabs which are ready for shedding.  These crabs are defenseless, and hide in the bushes for protection.  The fisherman slips a net under each bush; then shakes the crab out into the net.  These crabs are then placed in live boxes similar to the one shown here, and are inspected every few hours until they shed.

Inside the Tally-Ho Club		A pot-bellied stove with extended flue heated the sleeping quarters of the Tally-Ho Club while gas lights illuminated the room." To provide moist, scented air for sleepers in the room, moist Spanish moss was hung near the flue pipe above the stove and a water kettle was heated on the top of the stove.  The year-round mosquito population was kept at bay with netting draped around the upper half of each bed.  Throw rugs and chairs aided dressing and undressing with reasonable comfort.

Scattering oyster shells		In this picture is shown the newest method of scattering oyster shells in Louisiana waters for the tiny young oysters to attach themselves to when they first sink to the water bottom.  This method replaces the one formerly used in which these shells were scattered by hand with shovels.  It was developed during the summer of 1943 because of the shortage of manpower, and it has been found that this method scatters the shells much more evenly, in much less time, and at much less expense.

Walton Champagne pirogue		Top: The fallen cypress tree is split, a centerline marked, and rough shaping of the outside hull is befun with a hand ax.  Middle left: The hull is turned over and placed on sawhorses.  The inside is "dugout" with a hand ax as the boat slowly takes shape.  Middle right: Hand tools were what Champagne used to craft his dugouts from a whole cypress tree.  Bottom:  As the hull thickness is made more uniform, Champagne would drill several small holes through the bottom of each dugout.  He then inserted a special wooden gauge he made for determining hull thickness into each hole.  The holes were plugged and the finished hull was later fitted with cypress trim around the gunwale and movable seats.		TIF	Connor, Charles.

Sign for Battery 4 at Chalmette Battlefield, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve	2005	The largest artillery piece on the battlefield was a 32-pounder commanded by Navy Lt. John Crawley and served by 24 men from the U.S.S. Carolina.  It was removed from the Carolina in early December and was in action here during the January 1, 1815 artillery duel.  Struck by British artillery fire, the cannon was quickly repaired and ready for action on January 8.  This gun, firing grapeshot and landiage (scrap metal), tore gaping holes in the 93rd Highlanders as they moved across the field.  Left of this battery was Major Daquin's Battalion of Free Men of Color and to the right was Major Lacoste's Battalion of Free Men of Color.  These men impatiently waited to join the fight, but their muskets did not have range to engage the British.		JPG	Donald W.

Sign for Redoubt and Battery 1, Chalmette Battlefield, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve	2005	The main American Position was nearing completion when a redoubt was constructed at the extreme right of the American line.  It contained two artillery pieces that could rake the levee and canal.  On the morning of January 5, 1815, 2000 British troops under the command of Colonel Robert Rennie attacked the redoubt and forced the Americans to retire.  They quickly counterattacked and the British retreated after a brief fight.  Failure to penetrate the American Flank contributed to the overal British defeat.		JPG	Donald W.

Sign for the Battle on the West Bank, Chalmette Battlefield, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve	2005	Discovering American militia and artillery on the west bank of the Mississippi River, British General Pakenham ordered Lieutenant Colonel William B. Thorton to lead an attack force across the river.  Thorton was to capture the American guns and turn them against Major General Andrew Jackson's line here on the East Bank.  The Americans under Brigadier General David B. Morgan made a stand, but they were routed, pursued, and their guns were taken.  Fortunately for the Americans the British called off this engagement when they were defeated here on the left Bank.  The American casualties numbered 49.  The British reported losing 83 men.  The British assault of January 8, 1815, proved to be the only British victory.  Had the successes on the West Bank been exploited, the Battle of New Orleans might have ended in a British victory.

Sign for Lethal Exposure, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve	2005	The January 8 British plan proved easier conceived than to execute.  Due to numerous elays, the attack did not start on time.  About dawn, a rocket soared above the British lines near the woods on your right, followed by another rocket from their position near the river/  These signals to attack were answered almost instantly by a shot from the American artillery.  Major General Gibbs column gave three cheers, and the advance guard on both flanks moved in close order toward the rampart.  When the British attacked, the field covered with fog.  Major General Pakenham probably hoped this would give him back some of the advantage he had lost to delays.  Unfortunately for British plans, a breeze came up and the fog broke, exposing the British 650 yards from the American line.		JPG	Donald W.

Freedman's Cemetery sign	2005	Here lies the remains of ex-slaves.  The Freedman's Cemetery was established by the Freedmen's Bureau in 1867, when the bureau received permission to use four acres of the former battlefield as a civilian burial ground.  The property reverted to other ownership when the bureau was discontinued, and the cemetery gradually fell into ruins.  All above-ground traces disappeared before the end of the nineteenth century.

Sign for the Battle Ends, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve.	2005	Seeing the massive disorder in Major General Gibbs' column, Major General Pakenham rode forward.  While attempting to rally his troops and get the stalled attack underway, Pakenham was mortally wounded a few yards from this site.' Major General Keane, commanding the British near the river; sent the 93rd Highlanders to lead a second assault.  They crossed the field, moving towards Gibbs' troops on the British right.  This regiment was decimated with grapeshot and mustket fire.  A few men reached the rampart, but found no fascines or ladders or help.  They were quickly killed or captured.  When their commander, Colonel Dale, was killed, the advance of the 93rd failed and the remaining troops retreated in disarray.  Their withdrawal threw the rest of the British army into confusion and the men loss all sense of formation, retreating in terror and panic.		JPG	Donald W.

The Great Disturbance	2007-01-26	(Right)  The Acadians were deported from Nova Scotia in 1735.  Shortly after, New England settlers moved into the Fundy revion and profited from the Acadians hard work.  Unable to maintain the dyke system themselves, the new settlers relied on the talent of Acadians who escaped exile.'  During the 1940's many unrepaired dykes allowed the sea to recapture land and convert it back to marsh.  Fearing the loss of prime farmland, the government launced a program to support dyke restoration.  By the 1960's over 300 kilometers of dykes protected over 33,000 hectares (88,200 acres) of farmland.  In addition to the simple Acadian dykes, dams were installed across large riveres to further regulate tidal flow.  At this time, all attention was focused on saving profitable farmland and little consideration was given to possible environmental consequences.'(Left)  The only Acadians remaining in Nova Scotia were those who escaped into the woods and peacfully co-existed with the Mi'kmaq Indians.  It was these survivors who later emerged to continue the Acadian bloodline in the Nova Scotia town of Moncton (named for the British colonel in charge of the deportation) has become a hotspot for modern Acadian revival.

The lumber boom	2007-01-26	Lumber became a major industry in the state around 1890.  The depletion of northern forests increased demand for southern wood, luring some lumber companies to timber rich Louisiana.  Local lumbermen also began to expand their holdings.  The nationwide rail system provided efficient transportation of products, and technological innovations increased both the practicality and profitability of commercial lumbering.  The lumber "boom" continued until the early 1930's when the larger mills closed.  During the height of the industry, Louisiana produced two-thirds of the nation's cypress lumber.'  Lumbering consisted of three distinct phases: Logging, transportation from swamp to mill, and the milling process.		JPG	Donald W.

Dugout pirogue c. 1880s	2007-01-26	A pirogue is a small, flat-bottomed boat associated with Cajuns in the Louisiana marsh.  It can be either paddled or poled.  It is light and small enough to be pulled easily onto land, while the flat boom allows it to be poled thorugh shallow water or across mud flats.  South Louisiana loggers used pirogues to help guide cypress log rafts as they were sent down bayous to mills and railroads.'  Loaned by Sherry Ackman.		JPG	Donald W.
