Burrwood, Louisiana, and Southwest Pass jetties construction photographs, circa 1905-1915.	1905		Carnival--Louisiana--New Orleans--Photographs.; Hurricane damage--Louisiana--Burrwood--Photographs.; Jetties--Mississippi River--Design and construction--Photographs.	Burrwood (La.)--Photographs.		18 photographic prints ; 5 x 7 in.	Between 1898 and 1913, work was conducted to create a sustainable channel 1,000 feet wide and 35 feet deep at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River delta.  Surveying, dredging, and construction of jetties, sills, and other structures took place during this period.  The jetties were completed in 1913 and their superstructure received necessary repairs in 1915 and 1916.  A major hurricane struck the Southwest Pass area on September 29, 1915.  Summary: Fourteen of eighteen annotated photographic prints document construction of jetties in the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River delta, while three concern the aftermath of the 1915 hurricane and one presents a view of Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

Land loss rates. Report 2, Louisiana Chenier Plain	1990	Dunbar, Joseph B. Britsch, L. D. Kemp, E. Burton.	Dredging--Environmental aspects--Louisiana.; Environmental protection--Louisiana;		Geotechnical Laboratory (U.S.) Engineer Research and Development Center (U.S.)		Technical Report Abstract: Land loss mapping and rate curve development for 12 US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangles in the Louisiana Chenier Plain indicates the magnitude of land loss as well as the trend in land loss rates is highly variable. Two of the 12 quadrangles comprising the Chenier Plain show an increase in the land loss rate when comparing the middle period (1950's to 1974) to the most recent period (1974 to 1983). Three quadrangles have a constant rate. In the remaining seven quadrangles, the rate is decreasing. Differences in land loss rates among the individual quadrangles are a function of the geologic setting and the factors which contribute to land loss such as subsidence, storm-induced erosion, channelization of rivers and streams, and canal dredging. Specific causes of land loss are not evaluated in this study. Land loss rates for the entire Chenier Plain are presently decreasing from their high estimated to have occurred during the early 1970's. The average land loss rate as of 1983 for the Chenier plain is 7.74 square miles per year. On a regional scale, the land loss rate for the entire Mississippi River Deltaic and Chenier Plains is decreasing. The average land loss rate as of 1983 for the combined Mississippi River Deltaic and Chenier Plains (an area comprising 62 USGS topographic quadrangles) was 30.71 square miles per year. At its peak, approximately in the early 1970's, the average land loss rate was 41.88 square miles per year. Another data point is necessary to determine whether this decrease is continuing. Land loss data generated during this investigation are being combined with geologic data in a Geographic Information System to conduct detailed analyses of the causes of land loss in future reports.

West Access Channel realignment, Atchafalaya River : hydraulic model investigation	1989	Maggio, David M. Nickles, Charles R.	River engineering--Louisiana;	Atchafalaya River (La.);	Hydraulics Laboratory (U.S.) Engineer Research and Development Center (U.S.)		Technical Report Abstract: The entrance of the West Access Channel has required frequent maintenance dredging to maintain flow distribution to the West Atchafalaya Protection Levee. The channel has had a history of shoaling to the extent that the amount of flow through the channel has been significantly reduced. Due to channel alignment and length, the flows in the channel are normally too small to move the sediment through the channel. A 1:120-horizontal- and 1:80-vertical-scale movable-bed model was used to study the effects of relocating the entrance about 2.7 miles upstream of the existing entrance on the sediment load entering the West Access Channel. This configuration exited the Atchafalaya River at approximately 90 deg and decreased the length of the channel about 1.5 miles. The model results indicated the new alignment would reduce the amount of bed material entering the channel to almost zero.

Land loss rates. Report 1, Mississippi River deltaic plain	1990	Britsch, L. D. Kemp, E. Burton.	Public lands--Louisiana; Environmental protection--Louisiana; Dredging--Environmental aspects--Louisiana.;	Mississippi River.;	Geotechnical Laboratory (U.S.) Engineer Research and Development Center (U.S.		Technical Report Abstract: Land loss mapping and rate curve development for 50 quadrangles located in the Mississippi River deltaic plain show that land loss rates calculated for the 1930's to 1956-58, 1956-58 to 1974, and 1974 to 1983 time periods vary significantly throughout the deltaic plain. Differences between land loss rates of individual quadrangles are a function of the geologic setting and the factors which contribute to land loss such as subsidence, storm-induced erosion, channelization of streams, and canal dredging. Of the 50 quadrangles mapped, 14 show an increase in the land loss rate, 29 show a decrease, and 7 remained approximately the same. Specific causes of land loss are not evaluated in this report. On a regional scale, the land loss rate for the entire Mississippi River deltaic plain (an area of approximately 13,000 square miles) has decreased from an average yearly rate of 28.02 square miles for the 1956-58 to 1974 period to 22.97 square miles for the 1974 to 1983 period. Another data set is needed to verify whether this decrease in the average annual land loss rate is continuing. Land loss data generated during this investigation is being combined with geologic data in a Geographic Information System to facilitate detailed analyses of the causes of land loss in future reports.

Land loss rates. Report 3, Louisiana Coastal Plain	1992	Dunbar, Joseph B. Britsch, L. D. Kemp, E. Burton.	Dredging--Environmental aspects--Louisiana.; Dredging--Mississippi River--Evaluation.; Environmental protection--Louisiana;		Geotechnical Laboratory (U.S.) Engineer Research and Development Center (U.S.)		Technical Report Abstract: Land Loss mapping and rate curve development for 62 quadrangles in the Louisiana Coastal Plain shows that land loss rates and trends vary significantly throughout coastal Louisiana. Land loss rates for each quadrangle were defined for 4 time periods: 1930's to 1956-58, 1956-58 to 1974, 1974 to 1983, and 1983 to 1990. Differences in land loss rates among the individual quadrangles are a function of the geologic and hydrologic setting and the factors which contribute to land loss such as subsidence, storm induced erosion, channelization of streams and rivers, and canal dredging. Of the 62 quadrangles mapped, 9 quadrangles are losing more than 1 percent of their land area each year, and 12 quadrangles are losing between 0.5 and 1.0 percent per year during the 1983 to 1990 period. On a regional scale, the land loss rate for the entire Louisiana Coastal Plain has decreased from an average yearly rate of 41.83 square miles in the 1956-58 to 1974 period to 25.34 square miles during the 1983 to 1990 period. The percentage of land being lost is also decreasing from 0.51 percent per year in the 1956-58 to 1974 period to 0.35 percent per year during the 1983 to 1990 period. The regional land loss rate will probably continue to decrease slowly until a background rate is reached.
