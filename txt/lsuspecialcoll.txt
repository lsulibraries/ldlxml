Game of Logic	Lewis Carroll	1887		London: Macmillan		Logic, Symbolic and mathematical.	Teachers of logic have long used games as a tool for students.  Textbooks of logic dating back to the early sixteenth century1 present it as a game for an individual student. Lewis Carroll's The Game of Logic (1887) follows in the same tradition, employing humor as well as gaming to engage the student.      1- Wilfrid Hodges, "Logic and Games," The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2004 Edition), Edward N.

Long, Huey P. Radio Address, 1935 (transcript)	Long, Huey Pierce	1935				Long, Huey Pierce, 1893-1935.; Radio addresses, debates, etc.	Huey P. Long was elected governor of Louisiana in 1928.  Two years later he was elected to the U.S. Senate.  He continued to influence the state through his chosen successor, O, K. Allen.  In 1934, Long’s own presidential ambitions and his more radical social platform led him to break with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and form an alternative political organization, the Share-Our-Wealth Society.  Through the society, he advocated redistributing wealth through sharply graduated income and inheritance taxes. He found a ready and sympathetic audience for his ideas in Depression-era Americans.  Long effectively used radio to distribute his populist message.  This transcript is from a 1935 broadcast by Long. He was assassinated the same year.

Book of Hours		c. 1430	1429; 1431; 15th Century				Teams of scribes and artists worked to produce the illuminated Book of Hours on vellum.  This great treasure, donated to the LSU Libraries by John S. McIlhenny to serve as its ceremonial 2 millionth volume, dates from the 1430s.  Created in northern France or possibly in Paris, it is written on 163 leaves of fine vellum (a term commonly used for the highest quality of parchment) in a gothic book hand and illustrated with 12 miniatures, elaborate decorated borders, and many fine initial letters illuminated in colors and gold.  The miniatures depict biblical scenes, but they also reflect contemporary life in the mid-fifteenth century.	Manuscript on vellum, in a gothic bookhand.  8vo (196 x 140 mm.) 163 folios.  From the library of the Pasquier family of Paris.

Four Gospels of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the Authorized version of King James I		1931		Waltham Saint Lawrence, Berkshire: Golden Cockerel Press	decorations by Eric Gill		One of the most beautiful books printed in the 20th century is Eric Gill's edition of the Four Gospels. Printed at the Golden Cockerel Press in 1931, Gill's work was issued in an edition of 500 copies.  Gill (1882-1940) was a philosopher, sculptor, and type designer, whose beautiful Perpetua type is frequently used today.  His skill in matching and interweaving type with illustration was at its peak in the Four Gospels.

Musurgia Universalis sive Ars Magna	Kircher, Athanasius	1650		Romae: Ex typographia Hæredum Francisci Corbelletti		Music	The elaborately engraved title page is fascinating for its symbolism.  The top section is dominated by a triangle symbolizing the Holy Trinity, with nine angelic choirs singing a canon on the words "Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus" (holy, holy, holy). The middle section contains secular symbolism: a female figure seated on a globe holds the lyre of Apollo and the panpipes of Marsyas, musical rivals who were judged by the Muses.     The lowest part of the picture shows blacksmiths in a cave: the sound of blacksmiths hammering led the Greek philosopher Pythagoras to important conclusions about musical pitch.  Pythagoras points to the blacksmiths and holds an illustration of his theorem, also using triangles, and hence referring obliquely once again to the Trinity at the top of the picture.	A Jesuit polymath, Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) published more than 30 books on subjects ranging from China to Egypt to music.  Musurgia is his most influential work and was a source for almost every later German music theorist until well into the 18th century.  It is still considered essential to an understanding of 17th-century music and music theory.

First Six Books of The Elements of Euclid in Which Coloured Diagrams and Symbols Are Used Instead of Letters for the Greater Ease of Learners	Oliver Byrne	1847		London: William Pickering		Mathematics; Geometry	In 1847, noted English publisher William Pickering brought out an unusual edition of Euclid edited by an otherwise unknown mathematician named Oliver Byrne.  The book's startlingly modern diagrams make an interesting contrast with the elegant but very Victorian criblé initials that decorate the typography.Byrne's edition covers the first 6 books of Euclid's Elements of Geometry, which range through most of elementary plane geometry and the theory of proportions. The striking diagrams are the result of Byrne's attempts to present Euclid's proofs in pictures, using as little text - and in particular as few labels - as possible.		en			E. A.

After spending four years as an itinerant missionary, Hennepin joined an expedition of the great French explorer Robert Cavalier, Sieur de la Salle, intent on probing the Mississippi. Hennepin and two companions ventured up the Mississippi as far as the Falls of St. Anthony (the site of Minneapolis), and returned to the Great Lakes by an alternate route.<br><br>In 1683, Hennepin published an account of his adventures, Description de la Louisiane.  An immediate best-seller, the book went through numerous editions and was one of the most widely read first-hand descriptions of New France.  The map that accompanies the volume, entitled "Carte de la Nouvelle France et de la Louisiane Nouvellement découverte," makes it the first cartographic appearance of Louisiana as a place-name.

Cover										Kate Chopin (1851-1904) published Bayou Folk in 1894.  It was her second book, and her first to be commercially published.  Although today Chopin is considered among the most important women in nineteenth-century American fiction, she was a highly controversial writer during her lifetime. Her novel, The Awakening, published in 1899, brought Chopin critical abuse and public denunciation as an immoralist, and she consequently abandoned writing.  More recent critics call it a masterpiece of its time, significant for its social and psychological themes.  Special Collections recently acquired a copy of Bayou Folk, in which Chopin has written out and signed a variant version of her poem, “White Oaks,” substituting “live oaks” for “white oaks”:  Of all the places on earth I know I’d rather stay where the live oaks grow. From dawn till night, the whole day long They sing their musical, mystical song Of rest, rest for the time is flying, Dream, dream for the day is dying! Oh! That tomorrow were far away And all forever a long today When the world stands still and the soft winds blow In the beautiful land where the live oaks grow!  Although Chopin biographer Emily Toth suspects that the author inscribed more than one copy of this book, no others inscribed by her are known to survive, perhaps because the book was not made from sturdy materials.  In fact, LSU's copy is so fragile that the originals cannot safely be displayed.

Tractor gals	Spell, Viela	1920					Viela Spell lived and photographed scenes in Crowley, Louisiana, in Acadia Parish. When she began taking photographs in the 1920s the art of photography was no longer exclusive to professionals. Kodak had introduced the first disposable camera in the late 1880s with the advertising line, "You push the button, we do the rest." Anyone with enough money to buy a preloaded camera and pay for for printing could take up the hobby. Although not professional photographs, these images serve to document various aspects of Louisiana history that might otherwise have gone unrecorded.

He attended Cornell University and worked under Arthur A. Allen throughout the course of his graduate study. Tanner's master's thesis was titled "Sound Recording for a Natural History Museum." His Ph.D. dissertation, "Life History and Ecology of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker," was based on 21 months of field studies in the Singer tract in northeastern Louisiana, the last refuge for this nearly extinct species. In 1942 the National Audubon Society published Tanner's dissertation as "Research report number 1: The Ivory-billed Woodpecker."  The images presented here were taken by Tanner while on field study expeditions in Louisiana during the years 1935 to 1940.

Grew's first book on plant anatomy, The Anatomy of Vegetables Begun, was presented to the Royal Society of London in 1672. The Anatomy of Plants (1682), his best known work, is particularly remembered for its discussion of sexual reproduction in plants, which was a new idea at the time.  The book is illustrated with beautiful engravings that represent the three-dimensional, microscopic structure of plant tissues.		en		Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections	E.

Liriodendron tulipifera L., Tulip Poplar	Stones, Margaret	1976				Botanical illustration--Louisiana.;  Watercolor painting--Louisiana.;  Botanical artists--Australia.	The tulip poplar is widespread in the eastern United States and is used for interior finishing and cabinetry.  Pioneers used it for building, as well, despite the softness of the wood.  A handsome ornamental with attractive leaves and flowers, it is relatively fast growing and becomes a large tree in the right conditions.  The national champion of the species stands 124 feet high.	Specimen collected by Margaret Stones, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, 1976.<br><br>Acquisition of this drawing was sponsored by Mr. and Mrs. W. T. Hanna, Jr., in memory of Mr. and Mrs. W. T. Hanna and Mr. L. L. Morgan.<br><br>Margaret Stones is widely recognized as one of the foremost living botanical illustrators.  Born in 1920, in Melbourne, Australia, she moved to England in 1951 to study botanical illustration at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and in the course of a distinguished career became a principal illustrator for Kew Magazine and was selected as the artist for The Endemic Flora of Tasmania. Among numerous honors, she is a member of the Order of the British Empire and the Order of Australia; received from the Royal Horticultural Society the Veitch Silver Memorial Medal and the Veitch Gold Memorial Medal, and from the Garden Club of America the prestigious Eloise Payne Luquer Medal for special achievement in the field of botany; and holds honorary degrees from the University of Melbourne and LSU. <br><br>In 1976, Miss Stones was commissioned to create six watercolor drawings of Louisiana native flora to be a lasting legacy of LSU's bicentennial celebration. The LSU community was thrilled with the result, and the project soon blossomed with the support of people throughout Louisiana. By the time the project drew officially to a close in 1991, Miss Stones had created a major opus of more than 200 original watercolor drawings of Louisiana flora. The collection is unmatched in any other state.			Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections	E. A.

Transcript Crump 202A-B										Narrator: Maxine Crump 4700.0117 Interviewer: Pamela Dean Session I Transcriber: Barrett Campbell 8 July 1992 [Begin Tape 202, Side A. Continues to Side B. Entire Session I.] DEAN: [006] This is Pamela Dean. It's the eighth of July, 1992. I'm going to be interviewing Maxine Crump in her office. We're going to be talking about her life as the first black student to live in a dormitory at LSU. Let's go ahead and do it. If you'd start off just telling me, for the record, your name, when and where you were born, parents' names, and what they did for a living. Crump: Okay. DEAN: And then we'll go into the more general recollections. CRUMP: I'm Maxine Crump. I was born in Maringouin, Louisiana, in 1946. My parents are Pauline and Emmanuel Crump. My father worked for himself. He did various things. He was a barber; he owned a nightclub; he was a school bus driver; he was a politician; he was a landowner. My mother worked at home, a housewife. And I'm from a family of seven, and there were six of us growing up . . . the seventh child was born when I went to college. The earliest recollection I have of my life was between three and five years old. And I . . . it's a scene of me walking along a canal . . . in the canal . . . in the fall, just to hear dry leaves crunching under my feet. And I knew my family didn't know where I was, but I knew I was safe. It was a dry canal. It was near the house. It seemed far to me, but as I've gone back and looked at it now I realize I wasn't very far away from the house. But I liked being alone in the woods. I liked hearing the sticks and the leaves crack under my feet, and I liked taking long walks. I've done it for years. I still do it. We lived with my grandmother and my aunt. My grandfather was dead. DEAN: Is that on your mother's or your father's side? CRUMP: On my father's side -- my father's mother. I had a brother one year older than me, Eugene. DEAN: So you were the second? CRUMP: The second DEAN: And the first girl. CRUMP: Then the first girl. My grandmother was a slim woman who was . . . you could almost call her . . . What is that expression they use for people who are her kind of slim? She wasn't slim like you think of slim women. She was almost leathery . . . just very . . .  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A no fat on her. That stood out to me because she was so slim like that. She had long hair, mixed grey, even though she was, I guess, in her seventies. Her hair was not totally grey yet. My aunt was, in my opinion, in those days kind of fat . . . because my mother was slim, so my aunt seemed fat to them. My mother was very slim. And my dad was always busy. He was in and out. My brother and I played together very well when he let me play with him. Mostly he had his own thing. He liked to play with a little boy up the road -- there were no streets, there were roads in the country. He played with a little boy up the road who was his age. That was our cousin, and his sister was older than me so, at that time, I didn't play with her, because I was too little for her, I guess. But my mother commented how my brother and I played well together. We never fought or anything like that. DEAN: Well, good. Crump: [52] We moved from my grandmother's house when I was five. We moved to a three bedroom house, and just before we moved, my sister was born, that was two years younger than me. Then the twins were born, and I was sent away when the babies were born. I was sent away one other time when my youngest brother was born. DEAN: Where did you go when you were sent away? CRUMP: To my grandmother's. DEAN: To your grandmother's. CRUMP: Which was a happy time for me because my grandmother was very quiet and gentle, and she took me to visit. My mother didn't visit anyone, probably because she had so many children. So I loved visiting. I loved to hear people talk. I loved to hear old people talk, and in those days, they seemed to just sort of say things like, "Yeah, you know." That's how the conversation sounded to me as a child. "You don't say." "Well, I never!" [Crump and Dean laugh] I loved it. It was very expressive because by the tones with which they spoke I seemed to get the message of the conversation. Sometimes they would say things they would say, "Oh, watch," and it was like I thought I had intruded on something I wasn't supposed to hear, which I had no idea what that was. But they said I looked like I knew. DEAN: Oh. CRUMP: I had a knowing look. I used to hear that. I remember hearing people say I was smart. That started registering to me very early that I was smart and that I was finelooking -- not pretty, or not cute, but fine-looking. DEAN: What did that mean?  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A CRUMP: To me, it meant that I had a solid look that wasn't pretty, because I . . . it finally registered that pretty was what my sister was . . . dimples and curly hair and brown skin. I was sandy and light-eyed, which was unusual for blacks. So it was sort of pointed at like, "Well, her eyes . . . " It was just "her eyes". It wasn't really said what they were. Sometimes people would say, "Her eyes are pretty," but mostly it was a reaction to the color of my eyes being light, golden. They were lighter than they are now. So I would remember hearing being called "sandy" and that sort of thing. And . . . DEAN: Was this good or bad? Or just different? CRUMP: It was just different because no one said it really negatively. So I took it as just different, and I decided to like it. [Crump and Dean laugh] I was aware, though, that sometimes I wished that it would get me what my sister got me . . . picked up more. She got picked up and swung around and played more, and I felt like, I must look heavier and solid because I always had bigger feet and big legs. So I didn't look like I had the cute curly feet like little girls normally have and the slender little legs. I always had big legs for a little girl and big feet and hands. So I just felt like that didn't look like someone you pick up. Since then, I've been picked up many times and played . . . [Crump and Dean laugh] But I guess it was because something I wanted and finally met men who weren't afraid to pick up women with big legs. Maybe because I never really got heavy. I grew up to my legs. DEAN: You grew into them. CRUMP: That's it, I grew into my legs. I can remember the first year . . . Well, in the three room house . . . DEAN: Where was this you moved to? CRUMP: It was about a mile away from my grandmother, up the road, which was considered in the town. My grandmother was in the country; we moved to town . . . still on the bayou. And . . . DEAN: [101] Why was it you had made this move? Had your father taken on another job or something of this nature? CRUMP: Oh, good question. My mother really got sick, and her cousins who were twins and both nurses came to visit. They gave her a lot of books on health and raising children, and she did everything in the books. This was in the fifties when the . . . when the . . . DEAN: Right. CRUMP: . . . war, well, yes, late forties. World War II was over. They had all of these new ideas about how to take care of children. She went germ-free crazy. All the books  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A said, "boil everything", and my mother did all of this stuff perfectly and got very ill because she tried to de-germ everything in my grandmother's house for her babies. My grandmother wasn't raised in that germ-free era. Although my grandmother was clean, she didn't understand. "What is all of this boiling about?" My dad's cousin came to visit from Plaquemine, and she told my dad, she said, "Your wife is getting very, very ill, and if you want her you better take her away from here because it's killing her here." She didn't like my grandmother or my aunt, she said they were mean, thoughtless, and didn't help her, and didn't appreciate what she did. So Dad moved her. I think he had been trying to save enough money to build a house, but he decided to move into a house that the family owned already. Since it was just he and his sister and he was in charge of everything, he sort of took care of his mother and his sister. So that's when we moved. My mother . . . well, when we moved in the three room house, it was a . . . two bedrooms and a kitchen. So my sister and I slept in the room with my parents in a foldaway bed. It folded into a couch during the day. My brother . . . when the baby was born, he slept in a baby bed in that same room by the window. The twins slept in a roll-away bed in the back room with my oldest brother. Children can adjust to anything. DEAN: Yes. Yes. CRUMP: With the washing machine! DEAN: Oh, yes. Well. CRUMP: There was a hole in the floor, and a pipe was put through the floor to drain the water out. There was no actual plumbing in the house. There was plumbing in the kitchen for water, to the sink. And that was it. We had an outdoor toilet. When we took a bath, the water was drawn in the bathtub, and we all took a bath in that tub. DEAN: What was the order of bathing? Do you remember? CRUMP: I think from the oldest to the youngest. I think . . . I really . . . it didn't stand out to me. It was just always the way it was so I didn't notice. We took a bath in the kitchen. And then the water was, I think . . . when I got old enough, I would help my brother carry the tub out and dump it. It was what they called the number three tub. The number two tub was a foot tub, and the number three tub was a bathtub. Then there was the water bucket with the dipper, and that was for drinking. Then we had a refrigerator. In 1950, we got a refrigerator -- a General Electric. The radio was on top of the refrigerator. [Phone rings] DEAN: Do you want to get the phone? Do you want me to turn it off? CRUMP: Yes. [Break in Tape]  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A CRUMP: Our outdoor toilet, we would whitewash it with lime. It kept it from having a smell. It was what prideful people did. They whitewashed it. Because it looked nicer, and it showed something about quality . . . the image I picked up. DEAN: And it was more sanitary. CRUMP: It was. It was more sanitary. DEAN: Which your mother must have . . . CRUMP: She was Miss Germ-Free! [Crump laughs] DEAN: Hard to do without lots of running water and plumbing and so forth. CRUMP: She sacrificed greatly for it. We would . . . [coughs] At this time, my dad had a night club. And, so he would be gone about five o'clock in the evening. So we saw him late mornings because he slept late because he was up late. And then he was gone, because he also had gardens, and he was always gardening and that sort of thing. So he was in and out. We started collecting lumber to build our new house, and it looked like that went on for years. He was collecting the old rafters, so that it could be built with the most solid wood, that you no longer could buy, and beams and things like that. We would polish the furniture with lamp oil. We had to sweep everyday, and sometimes several times a day. My mother got us all involved in housecleaning. We even brought flowers in. We would pick wild flowers to put in . . . She would always say, "Now see, doesn't that look nice? Don't you like the way that looks?" I soon learned to wash dishes by standing on a chair. [Crump and Dean laugh] At the time, the road in front of our house was gravel, and they . . . somewhere in along there they started paving the road. Fortunately, they started in the summer so I could watch it every day. It was like my mission to get up and watch the road being paved. The school that I went to when I started school . . . I remember when my parents took me to school the first day. I got out the car and didn't look back. I just ran to see who I could go find to play with. That was my experience my first day of school. No separation anxiety whatsoever. I liked school very much. DEAN: Describe . . . How large a school was this? CRUMP: [184] It was a four-room tin building with a kitchen. Not a dining room, a kitchen. The desks, in the first grade, were wooden desks with the desktop. It wasn't movable -- the tops weren't movable. They were built almost like a shield that came out and around where you slid into your desk on the side, and then you had your table built in. But, I know they have now desks that you can open and move down. It wasn't  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A anything like it was made like that. You just had to slide in. My teachers, . . . Well, the rooms there was the first grade, the second grade, the third and fourth grade, which were in the same room. The fifth grade was at a community hall down the street, and the sixth grade was in a church up the street, a mile away. They would walk to lunch. Lunch was off the back of the first grade classroom -- how miserable. The first graders had to smell the lunch cooking, but we did get served first. DEAN: Well, there's something there. How many students were there in your class? How large do you think it was? CRUMP: I think twenty. DEAN: And this was a segregated school? CRUMP: Yes, all-black elementary school. The whites went to an elaborate, it looked elaborate to me, brick school, that started first grade and went through the twelfth grade. DEAN: Are we surprised? CRUMP: Big campus, huge trees, school buses. We didn't have school buses at that time. DEAN: And how far was this from your home? CRUMP: A mile. When I was in the first grade my parents drove us to school. I think first and second grade, my dad took us to school everyday, and after that we walked. I don't remember . . . the road was gravel when I first started walking, so the pavement wasn't up yet. Then when they did put the pavement it was only halfway. So once we left the pavement, we were on gravel again. My first grade teacher was very old. She wore a hairnet and cotton stockings and lace-up shoes and black dresses, mostly, with tiny little flowers in it, down nearly to her ankles. I think she had false teeth. They looked like false teeth. Her name was Miss Baptiste, and she wore spectacles. She was the original image of a teacher. She liked to drink RC Colas. DEAN: [Crump and Dean laugh] You painted a very vivid picture there. I can see it, starting from the feet up. CRUMP: [228] She taught the basics. She was very much for repetition and rote. I got my first image of my reading ability from her. She read a story to the class one day, and she said, "Who would like to tell me the story I just read?" I raised my hand. I came up, and I told the story. She was so proud. I had no idea I had done anything outstanding. She held me by my shoulders and stood behind me as if, "This is my prize. Now class, do you see how well she did that?"  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A Dean: Very nice. Crump: All of a sudden I thought, "Oh, I like this." I had a cousin who taught school. My cousin visited us one day, and my mother said . . . I suppose I told my mother about this. My mother said to show cousin Leona how well I could read. So I got my book, and I was reading for her. And my cousin Leona said something that just echoed in my head and imprinted as believability to me, because it felt good. When I finished reading she says, "Oh, my little cousin can really read!" I must have fluffed like a peacock. So I started getting the image that I read well. And, my, when I got . . . when, when . . . in the first grade . . . my brother had failed the first grade, or was . . . or that was the second . . . or she taught the second grade, too. I don't remember. I think he had failed the first grade, but he wasn't in my second grade . . . but he was in my class for a while. I'm vague on that. My second grade teacher appeared to be tall and slim. Bony almost, not skinny, though. She had something looked strong about her. She dressed a lot in beige three-quarter length dresses with belt of the same fabric as the dress. She had very pretty hair. It was always shiny. Sometimes she would pull it back into a bun, but she didn't look like an old teacher. She looked young with it back like that. Other times she would wear it wavy in the front but usually close to her head and smooth. She wore very nice shoes, high heeled pumps, and they would be reptiles and things like that. It's amazing that those teachers dressed so well in a four-room tin building. DEAN: Yes. CRUMP: Because a lot of them did, and there was no air conditioning. DEAN: That was my next question. It must have been very warm in there, too. CRUMP: Yes, and I notice that teachers now dress very casual, especially if they're going to be in any hot situation. But her clothes were dress clothes, I could tell. They weren't flashy, but they were professional clothes. She wore powder, and her blush appeared almost burgundy. Her lipstick too, was very dark, but very becoming on her. She had small lips, and she spoke very well. Everything was articulated perfectly. And she didn't have very much trouble disciplining her class because she was very strict. If she walked in and we were hanging off the rafters, she would simply say, "Sit down, and shut up." And everybody did. [Crump and Dean laugh] DEAN: What happened if you didn't? CRUMP: Everybody did! DEAN: The question never arose! CRUMP: That never came up. She did give whippings, in the hand. She didn't yell and scream because she didn't have to. She just said it very firmly and everyone followed. But  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A we got whippings for not doing our work. I remember getting a whipping once, and it was . . . I got a whipping with a string of kids. It hurt my feelings because I did not want to disappoint her, more than I cared about the pain in my hand. It was that I had met the discipline of what I knew better than to do. I followed the crowd. One other time I didn't do my homework because I had lost my pencil when I was playing at home one night. And my other brothers and sisters weren't in school. We had a three room house, and so I wanted to play. She asked me why didn't I do my homework. I had started and didn't finish . . . she said, "Why didn't you finish?" I said, "I lost my pencil." She said, "That is not an excuse." I had somehow knew she was right. It wasn't a good excuse. I was hoping she would buy it, but somehow I knew that not to ever sell that one to anybody. So I never tried anything like that again. [304] When I got to the third grade . . . Oh, in the second grade, I remembered, they gave us all . . . they gave us all blood tests for something they thought was going around. Somebody had something at the school, and I don't remember what it was, hepatitis or something, and they gave us all of the blood tests. They really did it awfully. I know that it was probably, probably the best they could do at that school. They set up the stations on the grounds, and it was like a series of tables, about four tables, and the kids were lined up in front of the tables to get the vaccinations. None of us could remember having had blood tests before. So we were all afraid. They described, "It's going to be . . ." They tried to be real . . . I guess . . . DEAN: Reassuring? CRUMP: Reassuring about it, thank you. Describing to us what it was going to feel like. It didn't help. It made it worse. So they were all crying and screaming, and one little boy, he had reared [up] and cried so they had actually scarred his arm with the needle. I saw him with marks on his arm, and I then became frightened. I wasn't frightened until I saw that. By the time they got to me, I was crying too. I remember the man said, "Are you going to stand right here in my ugly face and cry?" And I agreed, he was ugly. His teeth looked like they were decayed and had coffee stains. DEAN: Oh, dear. CRUMP: But now I realize they weren't decayed, they just were positioned badly in his mouth. It did distract me, though, because the blood test didn't hurt at all. DEAN: Good. CRUMP: I was really never afraid of shots before, but a blood test was different. I hadn't had one of those. I wasn't the type who cried when I got a shot. I thought to myself, "Why am I crying? Because everybody else is crying. This must be bad!" We used to get our . . . to get our . . . that's when they were giving measles shots and vaccinations and all that started coming in. My mother used to walk with us to the clinic, which was just a few blocks up the road, to get all of those shots, and I never cried. You know, kids would be falling out, and I was like,"It doesn't hurt."  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A In the third grade, I met a teacher who was twenty-four years old. She didn't look young to me. She had gold teeth. She had several gold crowns in the front of her mouth, and she grinned a lot. She didn't smile; she grinned. Because she was usually making fun of people, and she made fun of the kids a lot. She would walk in, if we were clowning in class, she would say, "Heathens! Heathens!" It may have quieted us, but it shamed us, too, and embarrassed us. At least that's how I felt. She taught the third and the fourth grade. So I had her for two years, and I was not someone she liked. It was the beginning of me losing my spirit, to me. I felt I had to defend my life from her. And I would tell my mother about it, and my mother didn't do anything about it. She didn't . . . She says, "Well, I'm not going to go down there and have them talking about me and saying that I'm causing trouble at the school." And I, that, that became very vague in my mind as to why my mother didn't come and stand up for me. I had no one to stand up for me. I thought that she was always on me. [357] She said I looked like death on a soda cracker. I don't know what that had to do with anything I did. I know I did nothing to get that name, but that's what she said to me one day. She whipped me all of the time for talking. The kids found out she liked whipping me. She would assign one of us to take names, so they always put my name down whether I talked or not. Once I discovered they were going to put my name down anyway, I talked all the time, and she whipped me all the time, and I had never cried. She said I took it like a soldier. But I just wasn't going to give her the pleasure of crying. Then she did the ultimate. They were going to have a school play. I didn't know what a school play was, but it sounded like fun to me. They described it. It was going to be Snow White. There were two girls in the class that were light-skinned, me and my cousin. My cousin was in the class ahead of me. So they wanted a girl that was light-skinned to play Snow White. They asked for me, and she said, "Oh no, she doesn't speak loud enough." I knew I could do it, and I wanted to say, "But I know I can do this." So they put my cousin Betty in the play, who really was more Snow White, she even had the black long hair. [Crump and Dean laugh] So I didn't get that part, and I knew she was wrong about me. It's like it stayed in my mind, that determination, because I knew I could do that. It wasn't until they built the new school, which was when I was going into the fifth grade . . . when I was in the third grade, it seemed, the fourth grade, they started building a new school. By the time I finished the fourth grade, I was so glad, because in my mind, somewhere along the line, I had wished I'd never have to go to the hall or the church. DEAN: Yes. CRUMP: That didn't seem like school to me. Something about that would have done something to me. I didn't ever want to do that. By the time I got ready to go into the fifth grade, they had the new school built. It was a brick school with corridors. It wasn't indoor halls, like the white school, but they were a much older school. We were built on a modern style, where you had the corridors outside. DEAN: So this must have been about what, '54? '55? Someplace in that?  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A CRUMP: Fifty-five. DEAN: Yes. CRUMP: So, in the fifth grade, I was in a new school, all new desks, everything was new but the books. There were no new books. I didn't know that there was such a thing as getting new school books. I didn't know that until I was in college. New school books? Our books were always recycled, always, always. My fifth grade teacher was a tall, slim, pretty woman, who wore skirts and blouses because that was popular in the fifties. The full skirts and blouses, and that's how she dressed. Very neat. It looked like she ironed every morning because she wore crisp cotton. It looked like she stayed fresh as a flower all day. And she wore the nicest cologne! I wish I could find it today. I've never smelled anything like she used to wear. I'm sure it was her chemistry that made it smell nice. DEAN: Probably even if you found it, it wouldn't smell the same as you remember it. CRUMP: That's true. DEAN: Nothing, never, ever comes close like that (?). CRUMP: Another thing that was fascinating about the school, the four-room school, that the principal that was in the four-room school decided not to remain as principal when we moved to the other school. DEAN: Was this a man or a woman? CRUMP: It was a woman. She was the most interesting woman. Her name was Geneva Mildred Williams, and we used to call her Mrs. G.M. She was short and foxy. She was curvy, and she had a curvy behind and curvy legs. She wore slip-in shoes . . . bare- back . . . sometimes they would have, she had some that . . . she wore a lot of black. Black knit. Knit dresses must have been rather expensive then because it wasn't a common fabric, but she wore knit dresses; fitting, scoop neck, low back, with cap sleeves, and big loop earrings that would almost touch her shoulders because she was short, and she had a short neck. She had very short red hair. She walked with her shoulders back, and she carried her head back. She wore orange lipstick, and she spoke extremely well, very articulate. All of the kids respected her. We were afraid of her, especially when she put her glasses on and put them down on her nose. It's not that she did very much whipping, she would just hit her strap on the wall and speak strongly, and everybody would just . . . but I, they would say, "Ooh, Miss Williams is tough." I was thinking, "Oh my God!" If I had to be in Miss Williams's class, I'd be afraid, but for a little kid, she frightened us a lot. But she laughed a lot when she would say mean things . . . but we still took her seriously. She was not nearly as mean as she sounded, but we thought she was kind of mean. Yet we liked her. It was a funny mix because if we would walk by, we would just walk by and say, "Hey Miss Williams," or "Hey Miss G.M.," and she'd always say, "Hey, baby." I  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A thought she was pretty. They used to wear the stockings with the seam, and hers were always straight. Those are the things that I noticed. DEAN: [451] Yes. So you were talking about moving to the new school, she didn't? CRUMP: She did not move on as principal. They brought in a principal . . . a man . . . a tall man who carried one shoulder up and one down. He always wore a suit, and he sort of walked to one side. He had big feet and big hands, and I can remember seeing that. I liked my fifth grade teacher. She seemed to be smart. She taught us a lot of things. She taught geography and reading, and she always put interesting things on the wall. This was new. We didn't have this the first four years. We had bulletin boards, but they didn't stand out as much because the rooms were not "stand-outs," but we had real things, and we would help put up the bulletin boards. I was very active in school. DEAN: Was she a new teacher? CRUMP: She was a new teacher. All of the teachers were new except the one that had taught me in the third and fourth. She was still there. Miss Baptiste had retired, and Miss Bell, the second grade teacher, moved on to the new school . . . still teaching second grade. The rest of the teachers were all new. DEAN: Do you have any sense of what their educational background was? CRUMP: Yes. They all had completed college. The substitute teachers . . . many of them had not. They couldn't find any. You know, they didn't have enough people. If you had had some college, you could do substitute teaching. The rumor was that Miss G.M. really didn't have a degree . . . that she had forged it. She had a shady lifestyle, which, which, which I, I, I am grateful for because she gave us a realistic image of life. She didn't have to be perfect to teach us. She was a good teacher. She really was very thorough. People used to . . . people today say they learned so much from her. She's dead now. They're all dead now, except Miss Hall, the one that I was telling you about in the fifth grade. Miss Hall's son was in my class, and he was a very cute boy. It used to hurt my feelings because she would whip him if he didn't do well. I felt like she whipped him because he embarrassed her because he wasn't smart and her daughter was. So I always felt sorry for Jerome. DEAN: When you say whip, precisely what do you mean? CRUMP: She whipped him in his hand . . . with a strap. DEAN: With a strap, okay. CRUMP: There were a couple of teachers who would hit kids about the shoulders, but they were considered the bad kids, and it was not a pretty scene. It felt like a lynching to me, when I saw kids getting whipped that way. I didn't like watching kids get whipped.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A DEAN: This was done in front of the class? CRUMP: [504] Yes. Sometimes outside, in front of the whole school, because kids would gather around. Mr. Williams, the principal, was that kind of man. He was crazy. The man should have been put away. No question. I remember one day a boy broke the fire alarm. He called the whole school out and made us stand in the heat, while he stood in the shade. He had two baseball bats in his hand, he said, "If I find out who did this, I'll bat their heads." We all knew who did it, but no one was going to tell because we weren't going to have the boy's head batted. Well, he wasn't going to do that, I'm sure, but he was . . . he would threaten us in those ways. But I saw him whip children in ways that you don't do. He should have been arrested. He had a teacher's meeting, and he held it a long time. And we had the most interesting boys in the class. They could get up and entertain us better than any stand-up comedians that I can think of. They were so funny. I would come home and tell my mother and father, and they would laugh. That's how funny these boys were. So they would get up and entertain us if the teachers were gone a long time. He came back, and they had windows on the outside that were really big windows, but then on the corridor side, there were windows up high, and they could pull in a draft across the room, which helped a lot. Well, these were open, and he could hear when he came down the hall this comedy show going on. So he listened for who all he thought it was, and then he walked in on them. He picked them up by their shirt and their pants, and he threw them outside. He pitched them. He pitched them like animals, which wouldn't be a good idea to do to animals . . . like sacks, he pitched them outside. Then he told them, he said, "I want . . . ", this is unbelievable . . . I can not believe he did this! He told them, "I want you to crawl from one end of the corridor to the other, and I mean crawl. Don't stop until I tell you!" While they were crawling, he was hitting them. It's, it's cruelty, abuse, battering. He did it, and the teachers stood by and nobody reported it. I would tell my parents, and they didn't do anything. Nobody did anything. This guy continued there until he started stealing, and they found out he was stealing. Then they got rid of him . . . he had finally broken a rule. You can beat the kids, but you can't steal. DEAN: Goodness. CRUMP: Yes, goodness. DEAN: Such a message. CRUMP: We were heathens. We were mosquito-bitten bayou heathens because the teachers were from the city. Only Miss Bell lived in the country, the second grade teacher, she lived up the street from us. Miss Hall moved out there for a while. DEAN: Now, were they from that area? CRUMP: No, they were all from the city. DEAN: They had all come, and . . .  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A CRUMP: None of them were from that area. DEAN: Being from the city means being from Baton Rouge? CRUMP: Baton Rouge. DEAN: So they really were urban, and they were outsiders? CRUMP: [569] Yes. They considered they had been sent to the country to save the heathens -- the mosquito-bitten heathens. Those from our area that had gone on and completed college, which I had a half-sister who had, had moved away. Yes, she taught in California. So no one had been educated there. In fact, my sister was the first graduate of the high school. What year did she graduate in? Fifty-something. The first graduate of the first black high school in my town graduated in the fifties. DEAN: I believe it. CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: I believe it. CRUMP: So the teachers had to come from somewhere else because there was no one there who had an education. Those who had been sent away to school to get an education stayed away. They didn't come back. What was there to come back to? Because we were taught to look down on the country. The country was the place to be embarrassed to be from. You always loved to look forward to your cousins who came to visit from the North or from California because they were the only ones who were anything. We weren't considered anything. We were . . . we were ashamed of ourselves, being from the country. DEAN: Those with, with get-up-and-go had gotten up and gone long before. CRUMP: [595] Yes. Gotten up and gone, yes. So my parents were determined that their children were going to "make something out of themselves," which was the country expression. "Yes, she sure is making something out of herself." So, yes the teachers were all from Baton Rouge and considered themselves well above us. When we didn't do our work, they would say . . . if we were making noise and they were writing assignments on the board or something, they'd say, "Look, let me tell you something. If you don't want to do your work, okay, because I have mine. I have my education. You've got yours to get." It wasn't very inspirational to me, though. Somehow that didn't make me feel -- I didn't connect with that. It just sounded like an insult. It didn't sound like a motivation. I remember they would do things like have what they called the "dumb row" which I didn't see it motivating kids, either. I saw it embarrassing them and shaming them. No one ever got off the dumb row. So it couldn't have been very motivational.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side A DEAN: No. CRUMP: It was just meant to punish and shame them, so forth. In the fifth grade, they started a school chorus, and I tried out for it. Only two of us in the fifth grade got selected for the school chorus. So I felt that there was some validation for me that the fourth grade teacher had said I couldn't do. It wasn't until the seventh grade when Miss Williams, who had stepped down as principal, was teaching the seventh grade still . . . the one that we were afraid to go to. By the time I got her in the seventh grade, she was no longer frightening to me. I wasn't a first grade kid thinking she was mean. She did tryouts for a play, for a Christmas play. The first time, because you see, until then, all of the kids were the same kids every year, and all the teachers were the same. They would just ask the next teacher, "Who was good in the last school play?", and they would just follow along. So you never had a chance, you had, your, your role was set. Well, Miss Williams did auditions, and I auditioned and got the part -- not the lead, but the next part. I went for the lead because I knew I could do that, but since I had never been in anything, I got the next part. DEAN: [654] Let me stop just a minute, I need to turn this.  [End Tape 202, Side A. Begin Tape 202, Side B.] CRUMP: [031] Okay. You want more coffee while I'm up? DEAN: No, I'm fine, thanks. It's very good coffee. CRUMP: I made it. DEAN: You did darn good. CRUMP: Thanks. So I was so excited about getting the part in the play . . . I did terrible in rehearsal, though. And when I was getting ready for the play . . . I was going to play a magistrate in the Christmas play, and I had to wear a towel on my head, but I had my mother to do my hair anyway. The towel was supposed to be the magistrate's headdress or part of the robe look. But the night of the play, I made not one mistake. I spoke loudly enough -- we had no microphones -- and I got laughs and applause. DEAN: Wow. CRUMP: And I helped the lead character with her lines. DEAN: Trying . . .  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B CRUMP: I was on my way. No one was ever going to say I couldn't do this again. I got put in plays after that, and I got asked to do readings after that. I was just known for that. I had proven, proven myself to me -- and everyone else. DEAN: Terrific. CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: So that overcame some of the negative kinds of messages you'd been getting in that context. CRUMP: Yes. Yes. I came out, I came out of flatness then. I started having friends. It seemed like in the third and fourth grade I was always battling for a place in line or something. Someone was always knocking me out of line or something. It was a big deal to get first in line after recess and that sort of thing. Someone was always elbowing me out of the line, and I was seen to be just this little ball that was trying to find my way. I was always getting at the end of the pop-tail, which was a game we used to play. The one at the end got whipped up the most, you know, got thrown a lot. Kept missing in jump rope, kept, kept getting my legs swatted with the rope when we would do hot-cuts. Until I got to the fifth grade, and all of a sudden it was like . . . I could do anything anybody else could do, except play softball. I was never any good at that. I couldn't catch, so I got selected last on the team all of the time as a result, which made me only a worse player. I play softball just fine now. But I started having friends, and we got into talking about records and movie stars and lipstick and things like that . . . I was good at all of that. And tv shows and who was cute and boys and books and things like that, and . . . DEAN: You had a television? CRUMP: [062] We had a television when I was in the sixth grade. In the fifth grade, we would watch television at my cousins' house. The reason we had a television is because my dad had a nightclub, and he had a television. So we got one at the house when I was eleven. That was fun. It was really, as I look back, it was great that we didn't have one before then because we were very creative in our play. We didn't have a lot of toys. We got toys at Christmas, and when they were gone, they were gone. We made up toys the rest of . . . we played hopscotch. We rolled tires. We shot marbles. We rode . . . we did have a bicycle until we broke it, but we'd fix it and ride it again. And we cooked grass. We made up ways to cook outside. We built houses from the lumber and the tin Dad collected to build the new house when we were in the old house. We would set up playhouses with that and use bricks. We did the nine yards, and we played in the bayou. Sometimes it would dry up, and we would play in the middle. It would create an island, and we would play in it. We'd wade through the mud. They had snakes in there, but we didn't notice them. DEAN: Woo!  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B CRUMP: Yes, I know, "Woo!" Cottonmouth moccasins were in that bayou. DEAN: Yes. CRUMP: My mother told us not to go in it, but we went anyway. She didn't know we were there. DEAN: Nobody ever got bit. CRUMP: No, no, not one even got their foot cut in the bayou. We got lots of injuries. I jumped up to get some elderberries once, and jumped down on a nail. Went into my heel, all the way in. I didn't go to the doctor. They put turpentine on it. Healed it. Oh I got more cuts and bruises, and scrapes and scars . . . it was just part of it to me. I would get my foot cut. I'd come in and get it treated and go back outside. No one ever got stitches. No one ever had an arm or leg broken. [088] My youngest brother had spinal meningitis when he was a baby, and we all had to take medicine because it was contagious. I remember we prayed every night for his recovery, by candlelight. The twins were three, and they were with us, too. I used to have to take my medicine to school. The teachers would give it to me. This is when I was . . . before the fifth grade . . . this was, I was still in the first when this happened. In those days, it was very rare that you recovered from spinal meningitis completely, but he did. He recovered completely, and the doctors said it was a miracle. I remember, my mother didn't go to the hospital with him . . . my dad . . . they went to the hospital in New Orleans because there was no Charity in our hometown and in Baton Rouge. It was only in New Orleans. It was a storm that night. It was the first storm I can remember. It was a storm brewing. It hadn't quite hit yet. And my dad and my uncle drove my brother to the hospital. There were no ambulances. The doctor had said, "Get him to a hospital right now." They drove so fast, they said they know the car left the ground several times . . . with the storm, and with the breeze, and all that. DEAN: Wow! CRUMP: My dad stayed with him, and my mother said she needed to stay with us. DEAN: Right. CRUMP: I think it needed to be the reverse, but they didn't think so. They gave him so many shots, he had a sore on his butt when they brought him home. DEAN: But it was a miracle. CRUMP: It was a miracle. He was fine. He went on to be a star football player. Now he has his own children, so yes . . . he did fine. He had no nothing, no deformities, no retardation, nothing. DEAN: Amazing.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B CRUMP: It was amazing. DEAN: [113] Was religion an important part of life? CRUMP: It was indeed. I remember making my first communion, and it was a big deal. In the summer, they had summer school for the Catholics. My brother was going off to summer school the first summer, and I wanted to go too, but I wasn't old enough to go yet. I went anyway because I insisted. I had heard my mother talking about the nuns so much, and they put me in a class with a lay teacher. I didn't want her. She couldn't know anything. I wanted a nun. But they said the nun was teaching the first graders, the second graders, because they were going to make their first communion. I insisted, and I cried. So they said, "We can't do anything with her. Sister, you come see." The nun came over, she says, "Well, let me see." So she asked me some questions from the catechism, and I knew all the answers. So she said, "Okay, come on in." She put me in the second grade class. DEAN: How had you learned the answers? CRUMP: I knew them from listening to my brother when he studied and my mother would teach him. When they gave out the first communion certificates, they called my name too because my name was on the list. My mother said, "Just go get it and give it back to them after church." So I was in the back of the church, and I remember I had on a hat. I walked from the back of the church to the front to get it. Priests never knew anything, they never knew kids' names. Nuns did, but to priests, children were just there. You didn't count. Maxine Crump . . . You've never seen me in the first communion line, but it didn't matter to them. They just did things by rote. I went up and got it and gave it back to him afterward. Yes, religion was very important. We had to say our prayers every night before we went to bed and every morning when we got up and grace before every meal. After we made our first communion, we went to church every Sunday, every Holy Day. We fasted on Friday. There was no meat on Friday. During Lent, it was one full meal a day. You could eat light meals the other two. We did all of that. DEAN: Was this an integrated church? CRUMP: Yes. It was integrated/segregated. It was the only Catholic church in town. The blacks sat on one side, and whites sat on the other side. DEAN: Was there a large Black-Catholic community? Or was this . . . CRUMP: Yes, it was large. It was just as large as the white community because in the town, there were more blacks than whites. DEAN: Were there Methodist, Baptist churches . . .  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: . . . that other blacks went to? CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: Was that a larger percentage of the black community? CRUMP: Yes. Yes, the larger percentage of the black community was Protestant, but there were quite a few Catholics. Yes, I would say it was just as many black Catholics as there were white. We sat on one side, and for a while, we had a third of the church. So it was a lot of standing, jammed up situations. Finally, it was moved to half. It wasn't integrated until I went to college, and it was integrated because I sat where I wanted to when I came home. Whites didn't sit on the side where blacks sat, but I sat over there. So did my whole family. They just didn't bother me. It just didn't make any sense to me. It still somewhat . . . DEAN: I sense you didn't have a lot to do with that kind of pattern. CRUMP: Didn't have a lot to do with it, yes, didn't. They still sit rather segregated in the church. It's kind of integrated, but it's still kind of segregated in the '90s. They all going to get to Heaven, I'm sure. They say, "If God would have meant us to be together, he'd have put us together." DEAN: Looks to me like he did! CRUMP: [168] Where did he put us? I remember asking my mother one day, "Mother, why don't white people like black people?" She said, "It's because they're ignorant." That's all she said. We lived next door to a Methodist church, and the family of the minister lived in the house next door to us. As the minister changed, then we got new neighbors. We always got along with them. We always liked them, but I always knew that they were Protestant which wasn't as good as Catholic . . . that God was going to let them in Heaven in spite of themselves, not because of themselves. I understood that. But we were nice to them, even if they were less than us. They were very nice Protestants. We lived on a corner, so the people across the street from us were our cousins. Cousin Corrine lived in an old Acadian- style house high up off the ground, high ceiling. We would love to go to her house, and she would always fix us Kool-Aid and cake or ice cream and cake. She had a tv before we did and a telephone. Not that we used it, we just liked to hear it ring. [Crump and Dean laugh] She was just real sweet to us, just real sweet. She was raising her brother's daughter. She was a little older than us, but she was very nice to us. So we just liked to go visit her and sit in the swing on the porch. It was great. Oh, I could swing all day. Then next to them was Mr. Buster, who had just moved there from the plantation. He had paid off his plantation dues, and finally was moving up to the city. He had sharecropped  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B until his debt was paid, and he had moved up to the city from the plantation. He brought his whole family, and we used to say they still lived plantation-style. They would walk to town with no shoes on, walking on the back of their shoes, slips hanging, hair not combed, and we used to think, "Oh, how awful." But it wasn't long before they figured out that that wasn't the way we lived in the city, and they changed. They started combing their hair, wearing shoes, and nice clothes. They had very pretty skin . . . smooth skin, all of them. And Mr. Buster started keeping his yard up immaculately. He was the janitor at the school, and he kept our school so clean. Our school was so clean. He was such a good janitor. He kept the schoolyard cut so beautifully. I never knew to appreciate him then, just took it for granted, but they were very nice neighbors. Next to him was a white family, and the man would speak to my dad. My dad said, "He speaks to me because he wants me to vote for him," because landowners could vote, and my dad was a landowner. Everybody couldn't vote, but landowners could. So Dad said, "He speaks to me because he wants my vote." He said,"But I don't vote for him because he hates black people, and I know it, and his family does." Well, they passed our . . . DEAN: [211] What was the position that he would have been running for? CRUMP: Alderman. DEAN: Alderman. CRUMP: City Council. His whole family -- he had two sons and a daughter -- and they passed our house every day, and did not even look in our yard. Did not even look in our yard. Mother said, "You think they'd look if the house was on fire?" We used to laugh and say, "No, they wouldn't." The oldest son was throwing rocks at my oldest brother one day, and my mother went out and stopped him, and he said, "He threw at us first." And Mother said, "He didn't. He wouldn't do that." She said, "Well, just don't do that again," and they didn't. So that was the only conversation I can remember between the rest of the family. But they never looked at us. The daughter was my age. Next to them was another white family, and they were very nice. They had moved there. They were not from there, and they would always say hello to us. Next to the church was another white family. They were very friendly. Behind us was a white family, they were considered poor whites. They walked around with dresses that didn't fit on the waist, bare-footed, kept a dirty house. I think the husband drank. Mother used to say, "You know they have nothing, and they are considered nothing among whites, but they know they're better than us." So I lived in an integrated community in a way. I had the experiences of whites in a way, and across the bayou was an affluent white family, and the man owned a store, and we used to go to his store because it was right up the street from us. So whenever we wanted . . . and he was very nice to us, and he always said we looked real nice. Occasionally, he would give us candy or something as we went there. He always said we were very nice, said, "You-all are very nice. You dress so nice." His wife had a drinking problem, but she would go on drinking bouts. She didn't drink all  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B of the time because she was a teacher. When she would go on drinking bouts, she would just take off sick leave and drink the whole time. Then she would get over it and go back to work. A woman worked for her, and she was young, a little younger than my mother, but she was single, which was rare. She was early thirties but single. Didn't happen in Maringouin. That was considered "Can't get anybody" Well, she wasn't considered attractive, so I suppose that was it. She lived in a little house on the premise. Since she was right across from us and she walked to work . . . or she would walk where she went otherwise because she didn't have a car. She and my mother visited a lot and they became very good friends. It was the first time my mother really started to recover. She had been sick a lot of years, and she became very happy. Those were happy days for me, and I'm convinced that when parents are happy, children are happy. Children really do feel their parents at a certain age. We just remember having very good times in the '50s. Times got very affluent. People bought cars. People bought new clothes for holidays. It just seemed to be a bustling time. [259] My dad had his nightclub. His business was going very well. He had a speaker on the outside of his place, and he would put money in the jukebox and keep it playing and people would think it was a lot of people there because they could hear the music, and they would come. So it worked . . . until they passed an ordinance that you couldn't have outside loud noises like that, but that was a long time. I remember we would sit outside at night. We would hear his music, sort of, just the background of it. Like now, when people drive down the street and you hear the boom boxes -- that's the way it sounded coming from his nightclub. DEAN: Bass. CRUMP: Yes. We would sit outside and build a smoke to fight the mosquitoes so that we could be outside. We smelled like smoke afterwards, but we could survive the mosquitoes. It was better than being in the house. But I remember the '50s as a lot of fun, a lot of good times. When every year the cars were totally different and my brother and I used to go up to the Chevrolet places to see what the new cars were like as soon as they came out. "Let's go see the new cars. The new cars are in today." DEAN: They kept getting longer, and . . . CRUMP: Yes, with more chrome, heavier bumpers. DEAN: Yes. Yes. CRUMP: So . . . DEAN: I need to take a short break and visit the restroom. CRUMP: Sure.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B DEAN: That's what coffee . . . [Break in tape] CRUMP: [279] My dad had a seventh grade education, and my mother had a fifth grade education, but they were very interested in education. My mother could have gone as far as she wanted in school. She could have even gone to college had she wanted to. UNKNOWN MAN: Thanks a lot, ma'am. CRUMP: You're welcome. She became ill, she said. She had to have her adenoids removed and things like that. She said she had dizzy spells, but the story doesn't wash with my sister and I. We believe she had all that, but we believe she didn't want to go to school because her eyes were crossed. We think that that was it, that she got teased and she never wanted to admit that that was it. She created the rest of this to get out of going to school . . . that was our belief. She has since had her eyes fixed, and they really weren't crossed that bad. She had what you call, I guess, a lazy eye or a wandering eye . . . wasn't exactly cross-eyed. DEAN: Right. Yes. Yes. Would there have been easily accessible high school for her? CRUMP: Oh, no, it wouldn't have been easily accessible, but her parents would have made sure she got there because her cousin who was her same age did get to high school and as a result, had lots of opportunities. If you were black and went to high school then, your opportunities were great . . . in the black community. DEAN: But you had to really be motivated. CRUMP: You had to be really motivated, and she was not. Teachers even lived at her home, and they could have taught her. They always rented rooms to teachers, so surely they could have helped. But she and my dad were always fascinated by people with educations. People would often ask them if they were teachers or ministers because with my dad owning his own business and being able to go places during the day, during the week. DEAN: Yes. CRUMP: Well, if you were a black man, and you were dressed, and you're speaking well during the day, you must be a teacher or a preacher. So they always would say, "Oh, well, are you a teacher or are you a preacher?" Always, always, always. He would get so tickled at that because every other able-bodied black man was working and he was not -where he could walk in town, especially to Baton Rouge. DEAN: Right.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B CRUMP: There were no others in town during the time when we would go. Sometimes I would get to go with my dad or something in the summer, and you just didn't see them. They were working. DEAN: Yes. Yes. CRUMP: So they were always fascinated by education and by teachers, and there was an encouragement to get an education. It was always there. It was always that as blacks you were going to need an education. I always knew that. Then they started saying that they didn't want us to just be teachers because everybody was a teacher. Surely there was something else we could be. That started coming in in the '50s, everybody thinks that you ought to be a teacher. Well, I knew by then I wasn't going to be a teacher because it seemed to be losing its credibility somehow. DEAN: Well that really had been the one option, really, for educated blacks. CRUMP: It had been. Yes. And my mother used to say "I wish you could . . . " DEAN: For women, for that matter. CRUMP: And for women that's exactly right. My mother used to say, "I wish that you could get a job like those ladies in the offices . . . one of those office jobs." Which there weren't, then. DEAN: Right. CRUMP: But I just remember her saying, "That looks like that would be a nice job . . . in one of those offices." My dad was always going in business offices or something. My mother would say, "Oh, that was such a nice looking lady. She had her makeup on and her hair done and her nails done. I mean she gets to go to work dressed up everyday." I was like, golly, sounds nice to me. So I remember hearing a lot of talk about people who were getting an education, who was getting to go to college . . . that got to be real big because then there was Southern . . . and I don't remember when Southern was there, I just remember hearing the talk of "going to Southern." People started getting an education, graduating from college, and this seemed to sort of get in there. By the time I was thirteen, I knew I was going to college. It was like I knew that . . . I was sure of it. DEAN: And the assumption at that point was that it would be Southern. CRUMP: Yes, there was no other alternative. DEAN: Right. Right. CRUMP: That assumption was all the way until I graduated from high school. It was assumed that I was going to Southern.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B DEAN: Right, right. Shall we move on to that moment of decision? CRUMP: It was a very simple moment. [Crump and Dean laugh] That's a very simple moment. DEAN: You graduated in the spring of `64, and it was in 1964 that a number of people had brought suit against Louisiana State University to have them admit undergraduates. Now they had been admitting, under court order only, a few blacks since the mid- fifties in the graduate program. CRUMP: In the graduate program, exactly. DEAN: And every step of the way had been resisted by the university, by the Board of Supervisors. Were you aware of any of this that was going on? CRUMP: None of it. I was unaware of all of it. I was aware of the civil rights movement, but I didn't know about LSU in particular. DEAN: [364] Well, let's stop a minute and talk about that. What about the civil rights movement were you aware of? CRUMP: I was aware that my dad had always talked about civil rights. It was just a natural part of what I knew. Men would come to the house and talk about it to my dad, and I would hear them. They were just always trying to get rights, just trying to get just ordinary rights. I remember seeing drinking fountains and restrooms, and my dad kept me away from all of that. We never went to anything that said "Colored Only". Never. If we couldn't use the one that said "White," we didn't use any. We never stopped anywhere that wouldn't serve blacks. We never went to the side window that was designated for blacks. We were not going to do that. That was out. I remember one day, we all wanted a hamburger, and Dad stopped the whole car. He says, "If they'll serve you at the front window, you can get it. If not, you get back in the car." I was designated, somehow. I was voted out among the backseat to go to the window. I knew why they voted me because my sister was brown, and she would have been recognized first. It was like, you know, among us kids it was like, who would have a better chance. It's night, and they might not know, and they'll serve at the front window. We'll get this hamburger, you know? All we wanted was a hamburger. We did not want to integrate, you understand. We did not want to make a civil rights statement here. We just wanted a hamburger. So, I went up to the window, and I was looking at the whites in the line, it was like, "Oh, please don't recognize that I'm black and start a mess out here." Because there were two windows at the front, so I went to the window that was behind one other person. At the side window, I was hoping that the blacks didn't see me and think I was causing trouble and making trouble for them or better than them. Oh, I was just in a dilemma. I just wanted a hamburger. DEAN: How old were you?  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B CRUMP: I think about nine or ten. So we got the burgers and got back in the car. DEAN: You did it. You did it. CRUMP: Yes. They just couldn't see that I was black because those Dairy Queen windows were . . . they had paper with all of the ice cream sales on the front, and they just raised the window and look out there. It was night, and I just kind of got away with them not knowing. But my dad felt triumphant that they had served us at the window. DEAN: That's a pretty heavy thing to put on a nine-year-old. CRUMP: Yes, yes . . . but he thought it was even heavier to make us go stand at the side window there . . . that it was more demeaning. DEAN: How did you feel at the time? Did you think he was right? CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: Or all you wanted was the hamburger? CRUMP: I really thought it was right. I think I'd have felt terrible standing at that side window. I really do. I knew I didn't want to do that either. I just didn't want any trouble at the front window. DEAN: How did you feel about how much that must have limited the things you could do if you couldn't acquiesce? CRUMP: I remember feeling the limit, and I felt the limit most of all when I got a tv, and I could see what was possible in the world. I wanted those possibilities, and I didn't like the limits. The older I got, going past from age eleven to twelve, the limits really started to bother me. I was limited by the fact that I couldn't buy hosiery to match my skin. That there was hosiery for black people, and the rest of the shades were white people. I wasn't the color that the stockings they had for black people. There was makeup for black people, and I wasn't that color. So it was "What is this?" DEAN: So you couldn't be wholly in either community? CRUMP: No. DEAN: You really were, by virtue of your skin color, in the middle. CRUMP: Yes, yes. The limits were there, but I didn't know whether there was going to be a change. I don't remember thinking of the possibilities for those limits, but I somehow wished for them . . . wished for more. DEAN: There were no civil rights demonstrations, sit-ins around that you were . . .  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B CRUMP: Not directly in the town at that time. Not until the sixties when we boycotted a store that had blacks only bagging groceries. The day of the demonstration, the day of the boycott, they put the bag boy on the register, and it was that way ever since. Now, the store manager is black. That same store. DEAN: When was this? When was this? CRUMP: [443] This was in sixty- . . . It may have not been until '65 because it seems like I wasn't living there at the time. It was after I went to LSU. Yes. The thing that my dad did, a lot of work was going on in Plaquemine, and that was still the same parish. The Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act passed, and that's when he started the campaign of just getting people to go vote. DEAN: He did? CRUMP: Yes. He did that every day. He spent every day talking to people about voting. They didn't want to. They resisted. They were saying, "What good is one vote going to do?" and, "Are they going to give me a test?" He says, "No, you don't have to take a test anymore. Just sign your name." Some of them couldn't sign their names. They didn't want to admit they couldn't sign their names. He would say, "You just put an X." It was a very, very hard task. It was very difficult for them to understand. A lot of people were very resistant, a lot of black people. DEAN: Was there any overt white effort to suppress that? CRUMP: Not that I was aware of. DEAN: No threats? I mean, he owned his own business. So he was less vulnerable than a lot of other people would have been. CRUMP: Yes. That's right, right. He and his cousin, who also worked for himself, themselves, were the major people in it. There were two other men in town, who also owned their owned their own business, and they were a paramount in it. It turns out, it ended up being a faction anyway, because there were these two blacks who were pushing for voters on one side, who were going to elect the white people they wanted, and Dad was pushing voters on his side to elect the white people he wanted. It wasn't to elect black people. It was to get the white people you wanted, the ones that were going to be more favorable. The two men that Dad felt were opposing him wanted the white people who were going to make sure they got kickback on money. Dad had wanted the white people who were going to do more for black people. So that was the push there. And that was the major . . . DEAN: One, one faction wanted to play politics Louisiana- style. CRUMP: [Crump and Dean laugh] And the other were real interested in civil rights. The one that the civil rights interest wasn't the money pay off. Because I remember a man  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B came down to the house one day and wanted to talk to Dad, and Dad said "You-all go inside." I thought, "I don't know why he wants me to go inside. I want to hear this." So I just went back to the window and listened to it. The man offered Dad some money to vote, and Dad said, "If you'll make out the check to the Community League ," he said, "then I'll accept it, but I will accept no money for me. And I will talk to them about endorsing you," (They had formed a community voting league.) "only if you will make these promises." When Dad finally did run on his own, and anyone questioned his integrity, I knew his integrity from having heard it when he didn't know I was listening. To this day he doesn't know that, I never told him. But I remember because I wanted to know what it was that Dad didn't want me to hear. I did ask him, finally, what didn't he want me to hear? He said, "Oh, sometimes those men use bad language." I'd think, "Well, what do you mean? I go to school, I hear all this all the time." It was simple as that, he didn't want us to hear bad language. But, you know, growing up in a town where the police are white. Everyone of any position was white. The mail carrier is white. The postal workers were white. The store owners were white. Everybody was white but the undertaker because whites didn't want to handle black bodies. And the nightclub owners, because they did not want to socialize with them. Other than that . . . and the hairdressers were black because they didn't want to do our hair. That's it. You could only have the jobs they didn't want. I remember my brother asserted his civil rights, he went into a store, and they didn't wait on him, and mother had sent him for something. He came back into the house, and he sat down. He did the defiance stance, sit, that I found out lately . . . He threw his leg over the arm of the couch, which is rebellion, and I didn't know that at the time . . . he was sitting like that. Mother said, "Where is what I sent you for?", whatever she said. He said, "I didn't get it." He was a little kid. He may have been seven. She says, "Why didn't you get it?" He said, "Because they waited on somebody ahead of me." She said . . . I don't know whether he said he told them and nothing happened, or whatever, but that's why he left because he was there first. [Crump and Dean laugh] He came home. So those are the kinds of stands we used to make sometimes. We were always afraid that they were going to pull that one on us because it used to get pulled on kids all the time. We knew that we could not come home and tell my dad that we had stood for that and did nothing. We somehow knew we were to stand up for ourselves. We were just hoping no one would pull it, so we wouldn't have to say, "I was next." DEAN: Did you ever have to do that? CRUMP: No, I didn't. I used to position myself to make sure I didn't have to. Just stand real close to the counter and look in their faces. They would have to say, "And what do you want, little girl?" [Crump and Dean laugh] "I'll take that, just don't skip me." But, the, the actual, the civil rights was just like that. I remember there were the Clouatres. They were white, and they used to sit on the black side, on the colored side, then, it was. They took a stand, and they would sit over there. We were in the choir, and so they joined the choir because the choir was all black. The  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B priest was black at the time, and so the altar boys had to be black and the choir was black because whites were not going to serve him. They took communion from him somehow though. DEAN: Sure. Well, he was a priest. CRUMP: He was a priest. Yes, he was a priest, but they were not going to have their children be altar boys of his, and they were not going to join his choir. He looked white. You would not have known he was black unless someone told you. DEAN: It was known. CRUMP: But they knew he was black. Yes. Occasionally they would have him in their homes. They really would. So it was . . . DEAN: For dinner? CRUMP: Yes, for dinner. They did. Oh, he was the priest. Some of them would; some of them would. DEAN: That's really a major factor, thing, isn't it? CRUMP: It was, yes. That's right. DEAN: Yes. CRUMP: I had never been in but one white person's home in that town . . . DEAN: Really? CRUMP: . . . the front of it. That was Miss Smith, who lived across the street who had the woman that worked for her. The reason I was in the front was when she was drunk, she would send for us to come in the front. She even let us play the piano when she was drunk. [Crump and Dean laugh] Other than that I could come in through the back and go in the kitchen. DEAN: Right. CRUMP: So that was a big deal, you know, that you went to the back. Now I don't go to the back of anybody's house. Some people say, "Oh, I thought you were ringing the back doorbell." Blacks, too, will say that. I say, "No, I thought maybe you'd be busy in the kitchen. I came to the front." I just don't like going to the back anymore. They don't understand they're just going to have to unlatch that front door because I'm coming to the front.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B DEAN: Of course, where I'm from in Maine, nobody uses the front door. CRUMP: Really? DEAN: Everybody goes in the back door, you just . . . CRUMP: It's considered sociable, right? DEAN: Frequently, frequently. Sure, I mean, frequently the front door sort of hangs there in midair without really stairs or steps to let you in that way. CRUMP: And really . . . that's why people use the back now, it's just informal. DEAN: It's just, I mean, everybody does that. CRUMP: Yes. Yes. I just don't have the old . . . DEAN: I'd think you were rather strange if you came to the front door. CRUMP: Yes, well, they do think I'm rather strange. DEAN: The significance there is different. It's quite different. CRUMP: Yes. Yes. Well it's, you know, it is now, and people think I'm still a little strange coming to the front door. "Oh, gee, I heard the bell and thought you were at the back." "Well, no, I thought maybe you were busy in the back." I'm out of coffee. [611] But the actual decision to go to LSU just came one day when I was outside, and my dad says, "well, you know LSU's integrated now, and would you be interested in going to LSU?" I said, "Yeah, I would." Just like that. DEAN: Now you had gone to segregated schools all the way through high school? CRUMP: Yes, yes. One of the things that had happened, though, that made the decision that simple for me, is my mother used to hassle me, at least it seemed to me, I would hear her talking about girls who had gone to college and came home pregnant and how wild she had heard it was at Southern. She had heard that some of the teachers weren't competent, and that your education really wasn't valued once you got out of there. That had started happening in the '60s. It wasn't valued by white companies, and people were starting to try to apply to white companies. So those were images that I had heard about Southern. I felt that if I was going there I was going to get less than a valued education. That had been in there, sort of sitting, but I didn't have another option. So when he said LSU, I knew the credibility it had. So it was a sort of easy decision for me. The desegregation part of it, I felt like, "What could be any harder than what I had already gone through in the church, in the town, going to back doors? How could LSU be any harder than that?"  Crump, Maxine - Tape 202, Side B DEAN: Despite the fact that you knew you were going to be one of a very, very small minority in . . . CRUMP: Yes. Yes. I thought, "So what? I've been a minority all my life!" It was nothing. I didn't see where it was going to be anything hard about it for me. As far as there being all white -- that hardly bothered me. I had been treated black all my life. I had been treated less than. If I could get a good education out of it, that's all that mattered to me. I didn't care about the fact they weren't going to like me. I decided I'd like them. I never disliked white people, no matter what they did. I didn't see where they had done anything for me to dislike. I just saw them making ignorant decisions. My mother told me it was ignorant early on. So I didn't know what there wasn't to like. I didn't like what they did, but I didn't dislike them. My mother had told me that my heritage was white, that my great-grandfathers on both sides were white. It made it kind of hard for me to dislike them. DEAN: Let's put a new tape in here. CRUMP: [665] Okay.  [End Tape 202, Side B. Begin Tape 203, Side A.] DEAN: [005] Alright. We're back again. CRUMP: My dad do and say things like when he had his nightclub, he would have his deliveries made at the house. Because a lot of the nightclubs in town were also stores, and so they were open all day. So they made deliveries there. Dad's was only a straight nightclub, and it was open only in the evenings. So his deliveries would be made at the house. We would sign for products and things like that, and all of us were designated to do that. Dad would tell us how to behave with them, you know that we were to be polite, we and we were not to accept any mistreatment. Well, none of them mistreated us. They were all very nice to us. But I remember they would say things to him, like they would call him "Hoss". He would just call them "Hoss" back. I never understood what the "Hoss" was, but he said it was something white men did to black men is call you "Hoss". So he called them "Hoss" back. I remember there was a man next door that was knocking on the neighbor's door. He asked Dad, "Do you know if Willie Hall is home?" And Dad says, "No, but his wife is there." He said, "But I don't know her name." And Dad said, "Her name is Mrs. Hall." Those are the kinds of things he used to have to think to do. The man looked really baffled. He's like, "I'm not going to call this black woman Mrs. Hall, excuse me." So he just left. He just walked away. My mother never told them her first name, so they would just say good evening. She wasn't going to have them calling her Pauline. Anyone else, but not . . . it was for the reason that they wanted to use her first name. DEAN: Right, right.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 203, Side A CRUMP: So those are the kinds of little things I used to see my parents having to do, and Dad never said "Mr." anyone. He just say, "I don't 'Mister' no white man." Because it was required to say, "Yes sir" and "Mister," and he wasn't going to do those things. So he didn't "Mister" anybody. Everybody was whatever their first name was. Of course, they first named him, but he first named them, too. Unless they called him "Hoss," then he called them "Hoss", too. [Crump and Dean laugh] It's only funny now. It's really terribly stupid, you know, that that kind of oppression was even leveed on anyone for whatever reason. So after living through all of that and seeing all of the things that I saw, what could LSU do to me? DEAN: You didn't think it would be more fun to be in a group of . . . CRUMP: Black kids? No. DEAN: Black kids like yourself where you . . . CRUMP: [044] No. No, because my mother was probably going to send me away with so many restrictions. They weren't going to let me live on campus at Southern because they didn't trust the dormitories there. At LSU, they were going to let me live on campus. I was looking at the advantages. I'm going to be away from home, be living on campus. At Southern, I'd have to commute. The thought of commuting just . . . I could imagine myself being tired because I was anemic. So tired was something that I got very easily. The thought of traveling back and forth in the car to school everyday was just tiring. To think of coming home and studying college work in the midst of my brothers and sisters who were in high school and elementary school . . . DEAN: Had your father gotten the house built by then? CRUMP: Yes, the house was built in '57. DEAN: So you did at least have a little more room? CRUMP: Yes, I had more room, but still not enough for college work. I just felt like college needed to be totally separate. Something in me . . . DEAN: Not with six kids in the family. CRUMP: [052] Yes, yes, I wanted to be away from there. I had had it. I was done with that. My brothers were wild. The fact that I was going . . . When Dad took me to LSU and I saw the campus and I saw how pretty it was, I wanted to go there. I didn't think about how I was going to be treated because that . . . I saw what I was going to like about it. I saw a pretty campus with good buildings, and I saw the dormitories. They looked good and clean and solid, and I was going to have my own room. That's all I thought about. I was going to be going to a school that's credible and one that where my mother trusted me to live on campus without the restrictions. When I was in high school, I didn't get to hang out with my friends anyway, except at school.  Crump, Maxine - Tape 203, Side A DEAN: Oh really? CRUMP: Yes, so I wasn't used to a big social life anyway. DEAN: [065] Had you done any dating in high school? CRUMP: Very little. Very, very little. There, I think boys had come to the house, and I had gone to the prom. I'd get to go to some games and see them there. No one had picked me up and took me to the game. Once, in [my] senior year, when our class gave a supper, I got to go for a ride in the car with my boyfriend and my girlfriend's boyfriend, and we had more fun! Just fun, you know, it was like, "What does my mother think is so bad about this?" [Crump and Dean laugh] And I got to go on the senior class trip but not with my boyfriend, I had to ride the bus with the rest of the kids while he drove in the car because my mother didn't trust me to ride with him. DEAN: Where was the trip to? CRUMP: A beach not very far from us. It was a day's bus ride. It was nothing. It wasn't even a nice beach. It was a made up beach. DEAN: Well, there aren't any beaches in Louisiana. CRUMP: Yes. It was the only beach the blacks could go to. We couldn't go to the other beaches in Louisiana that were also made up. This one was even worse made up, but we enjoyed it. DEAN: Well, we've been going for quite a while now. Do you want to stop now and set up another time? CRUMP: Sure, we can do that. DEAN: To, to go on with the LSU, per se? CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: Is that all right with you? CRUMP: Yes, that would be fine. DEAN: [083] Good. Good. [End Tape 203, Side A.

Transcript Crump 203A										Narrator: Maxine Crump 4700.0117 Interviewer: Pamela Dean Session I Transcriber: Barrett Campbell 8 July 1992 Maxine Crump 4700.0117 Tape 203 Side A DEAN: [005] Alright. We're back again. CRUMP: My dad do and say things like when he had his nightclub, he would have his deliveries made at the house. Because a lot of the nightclubs in town were also stores, and so they were open all day. So they made deliveries there. Dad's was only a straight nightclub, and it was open only in the evenings. So his deliveries would be made at the house. We would sign for products and things like that, and all of us were designated to do that. Dad would tell us how to behave with them, you know that we were to be polite, we and we were not to accept any mistreatment. Well, none of them mistreated us. They were all very nice to us. But I remember they would say things to him, like they would call him "Hoss". He would just call them "Hoss" back. I never understood what the "Hoss" was, but he said it was something white men did to black men is call you "Hoss". So he called them "Hoss" back. I remember there was a man next door that was knocking on the neighbor's door. He asked Dad, "Do you know if Willie Hall is home?" And Dad says, "No, but his wife is there." He said, "But I don't know her name." And Dad said, "Her name is Mrs. Hall." Those are the kinds of things he used to have to think to do. The man looked really baffled. He's like, "I'm not going to call this black woman Mrs. Hall, excuse me." So he just left. He just walked away. My mother never told them her first name, so they would just say good evening. She wasn't going to have them calling her Pauline. Anyone else, but not . . . it was for the reason that they wanted to use her first name. DEAN: Right, right. CRUMP: So those are the kinds of little things I used to see my parents having to do, and Dad never said "Mr." anyone. He just say, "I don't 'Mister' no white man." Because it was required to say, "Yes sir" and "Mister," and he wasn't going to do those things. So he didn't "Mister" anybody. Everybody was whatever their first name was. Of course, they first named him, but he first named them, too. Unless they called him "Hoss," then he called them "Hoss", too. [Crump and Dean laugh] It's only funny now. It's really terribly stupid, you know, that that kind of oppression was even leveed on anyone for whatever reason. So after living through all of that and seeing all of the things that I saw, what could LSU do to me?  Crump, Maxine - Tape 203, Side A DEAN: You didn't think it would be more fun to be in a group of . . . CRUMP: Black kids? No. DEAN: Black kids like yourself where you . . . CRUMP: [044] No. No, because my mother was probably going to send me away with so many restrictions. They weren't going to let me live on campus at Southern because they didn't trust the dormitories there. At LSU, they were going to let me live on campus. I was looking at the advantages. I'm going to be away from home, be living on campus. At Southern, I'd have to commute. The thought of commuting just . . . I could imagine myself being tired because I was anemic. So tired was something that I got very easily. The thought of traveling back and forth in the car to school everyday was just tiring. To think of coming home and studying college work in the midst of my brothers and sisters who were in high school and elementary school . . . DEAN: Had your father gotten the house built by then? CRUMP: Yes, the house was built in '57. DEAN: So you did at least have a little more room? CRUMP: Yes, I had more room, but still not enough for college work. I just felt like college needed to be totally separate. Something in me . . . DEAN: Not with six kids in the family. CRUMP: [052] Yes, yes, I wanted to be away from there. I had had it. I was done with that. My brothers were wild. The fact that I was going . . . When Dad took me to LSU and I saw the campus and I saw how pretty it was, I wanted to go there. I didn't think about how I was going to be treated because that . . . I saw what I was going to like about it. I saw a pretty campus with good buildings, and I saw the dormitories. They looked good and clean and solid, and I was going to have my own room. That's all I thought about. I was going to be going to a school that's credible and one that where my mother trusted me to live on campus without the restrictions. When I was in high school, I didn't get to hang out with my friends anyway, except at school. DEAN: Oh really? CRUMP: Yes, so I wasn't used to a big social life anyway. DEAN: [065] Had you done any dating in high school? CRUMP: Very little. Very, very little. There, I think boys had come to the house, and I had gone to the prom. I'd get to go to some games and see them there. No one had picked me up and took me to the game. Once, in [my] senior year, when our class gave a supper, 2  Crump, Maxine - Tape 203, Side A I got to go for a ride in the car with my boyfriend and my girlfriend's boyfriend, and we had more fun! Just fun, you know, it was like, "What does my mother think is so bad about this?" [Crump and Dean laugh] And I got to go on the senior class trip but not with my boyfriend, I had to ride the bus with the rest of the kids while he drove in the car because my mother didn't trust me to ride with him. DEAN: Where was the trip to? CRUMP: A beach not very far from us. It was a day's bus ride. It was nothing. It wasn't even a nice beach. It was a made up beach. DEAN: Well, there aren't any beaches in Louisiana. CRUMP: Yes. It was the only beach the blacks could go to. We couldn't go to the other beaches in Louisiana that were also made up. This one was even worse made up, but we enjoyed it. DEAN: Well, we've been going for quite a while now. Do you want to stop now and set up another time? CRUMP: Sure, we can do that. DEAN: To, to go on with the LSU, per se? CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: Is that all right with you? CRUMP: Yes, that would be fine. DEAN: [083] Good. Good. [End Tape 203, Side A.

Transcript Crump 204A-B										Narrator: Maxine Crump 4700.0117 Interviewer: Pamela Dean Session II Transcriber: Barrett Campbell 14 July 1992 [Begin Tape 204, Side A. Begin Session II.] DEAN: All right. We had gotten you to the point last week of your father had suggested to you you might want to go to LSU rather than Southern, and you thought it sounded like a good idea. Now I know that the university and the board and the state legislature had all been consistently resisting integration and only doing it under court order. This process had been going on over the last eight to ten years before you arrived there. And undergraduate enrollment had been opened up under court order again. You, as you told me, were the only woman who was not from Baton Rouge who came that year. Is that right? CRUMP: No, I was the only one who lived on campus. DEAN: The only one who lived on campus. Okay. I know when the first black student came to register that the president of the university and somebody from the state police, I think, accompanied him. CRUMP: He came in the summer. DEAN: In the summer and registered. How did you go about registering? CRUMP: By the fall, that had changed because I met some other black students when I came there, and they talked to me more about the university than about what it was like being black there. They just were asking questions about what classes to take and that sort of thing. I was almost oblivious, at that point, of what my presence there was meaning as far as the university. I had a hard time keeping focus on being black because having gone to an all black high school, you didn't have to think about being black all the time. Fortunately, I was still in that mode. I mean, I thought of myself as Maxine, a freshman going to college. I saw white people all around me, but since I didn't see a contrast -- I saw very few blacks--I didn't think of myself . . . it's not that I didn't know I was black, but it wasn't any more conscious of me that I was black than it was of the white students that they were white. I was just Maxine. So registration just was normal. I didn't notice anything. Noticed nothing. DEAN: No. You didn't hear any expression of resentment that you were there? No sense that anybody was trying to make this difficult? CRUMP: Nothing. DEAN: Suggesting you shouldn't be here?  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A CRUMP: [25] That's right, and my parents never spoke to me that I might encounter anything like that. I talked with J. K. Haynes who was instrumental in helping me get a small scholarship to go there, and I think he was also instrumental in helping the other students go there. DEAN: Now, who was he? CRUMP: J. K. Haynes, at the time, was head of Urban League [Louisiana Education Association], I believe . . . I think, I'm not sure. He was some civil rights activist at the very sophisticated level. He's a very classy, sophisticated man till the day. He's just one of these designers of the culture. Going to his office, he treated me with a lot of quality, and he treated me like I was special, and, and like I, I was . . . it was an honor for me to be able to go to LSU. I heard all of that and it felt nice, but I didn't feel any burden with it. DEAN: No sense that you were a pioneer, breaking new ground and had a mission? CRUMP: It was like I knew it. Right. It was like I knew it, but I had no perspective on what that really meant. I couldn't relate it to anything. I just heard it and took it as it was and just did what I did. Felt good with it, didn't quite know what it meant, but was willing to participate in it. Wasn't frightened, because I didn't know what to be frightened of. No one told me what to be frightened of. I think that was very fortunate that no one warned me about LSU -- not a single soul. If they did, I never heard them. I heard no warnings. I think, perhaps, my Dad protected me from it because he told me not to tell anyone until I actually got there, until we were actually going. I think that may have been his way of protecting me from hearing any negatives, so I had no negatives going in. Registration was just as tough as registration could be for me, coming from a small town. DEAN: Was it one of these, you know, you have to go to the gym and stand in long lines, and go through all of that sort of thing? CRUMP: Oh, yes, it was horrendous, yes. As far as it was for me, I seemed to be going to the wrong places, and oh I was just miserable. People would say, "Ha! I got registered in two hours." It was like, "How? It took me all day!" I was just in pain at the end of the day, but very willing, very willing. I had moved on campus, of course, I think a week ahead and had the orientation and all that. DEAN: Let's go back and talk about that . . . Let's talk about arriving on campus, and your impression of the place, and moving into the dorm and so forth. CRUMP: [51] Oh, I thought it was the most beautiful world I had stepped into. The main thing I noticed was the tower and the trees. I thought they were the most beautiful trees I had ever seen. I thought, "Surely there can't be a more pretty campus anywhere." When I got to the dorm, I had no idea that I was getting in this dorm because I was black, and it was a place to put me where I wouldn't be with the other students. I never was aware of that, and my parents said nothing about it. They knew, but they said nothing. It was a  2  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A little dorm called Louise Garig. If you ask most people on campus, they don't know where Louise Garig is. It's in the horseshoe area, and it was connected to a large dorm called Highland, which was connected to another large dorm called Evangeline. I forget what the other one was across the horseshoe. Instead of me going through the big door, Highland was the door that everyone went through, even if you lived in Louise Garig. But the day I moved in, the door to Louise Garig was open. The only day it had been open that I knew of was so that we could bring our things in. So I was just busy packing things in my room, and then said goodbye to my parents who looked very sad. I couldn't understand . . . why are they looking like that? I thought they'd be glad to be rid of me. Then I just went about packing my room and reading the material they had left in there for me, seeing what was the next scheduled thing that I had to do and just getting ready to be really excited about college life. DEAN: Where was your room in the dormitory? CRUMP: That's another thing. It was at a perfect spot. I didn't have to pass anybody's room to get to my room. It was at the very . . . soon as I climbed the stairs, I walked right into my door. So I didn't have to pass anyone else's door. They had to pass mine, but they didn't have to see me walking in the hall. DEAN: Was this a dorm room that had its own bathroom, or was there a shared bathroom for all the floor? How was that laid out? CRUMP: It had its own bathroom. It had a suite, but no one was in the suite. So I had my own bathroom. Oh, I was a special student. I was laid out. DEAN: Did you become aware that your housing situation was any different than anybody else's? CRUMP: Yes, yes, about halfway through the year. It took me until about halfway through when everybody had a roommate, and I kept thinking, "Surely I'm going to get one, too. She's just not here yet." Some of the girls commented, "You're lucky. I have to go down the hall to the bathroom." I'm thinking, "Yes, I am. I really like having this bathroom, you know." I met a Latin American student, and we became friends. She said that she liked talking to me because I understood her accent. I understood her English through her accent, and she said, "The other Americans say they can't understand me." She said, "And I can understand you because you speak slowly enough." I speak rather rapidly, but I think she understood me for a different reason. It couldn't have been because I spoke slowly, because normally I don't. We became friends, and she wanted to room with me. I didn't really want a roommate at that point, and I didn't tell her no. But she went over to the housing and asked. She came back and she told me, she said that they told her that it wouldn't be proper. They said, "Are you aware that she's black?" She said, "Of Course!" I felt hurt and shocked, and it was an awakening that I had. But then, it was like, well, I didn't, didn't really want a roommate, and she, and she was not really . . . well, who I  3  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A wanted as a friend. I felt like we were not well matched as friends. I liked her, but I didn't want to have her as a roommate. If I'd had her as a roommate and not a friend, it would work, but a friend and a roommate with us being unmatched as friends, I didn't think would work. I don't know if I thought it out quite that sophisticatedly then, but it soon passed because I enjoyed having a room to myself. My dad gave me a special treat and paid for linen service for me so I didn't have to worry with laundering sheets and towels and stuff. I had that every how ever often we got it, and that was fun. DEAN: Nice little luxury. CRUMP: It was. DEAN: Tell me about some of the other friends that you made. CRUMP: [105] Okay. On my floor was about two or three other rooms -- some of the neatest women probably ever at that university. I didn't know at the time, but they chose them based on their willingness to live in the dorm with a black student. I had no idea. One of them was from New York and an actress. One of them was from Panama. I don't remember the others, but they were very nice. I think the university set it up that way. I think they consciously did it. So they would come to my room and sit on the floor and talk, and I'd go to theirs. We'd answer each other's phones. Oh, there was another student on that floor who was an actress, too, and both of the actress women were the most interesting women I have ever met. I mean, they seemed older than me because they knew so much, and they were from northern cities. The North will accept her. The South won't. There were no Southerners on that floor. In fact, I'm almost just really realizing this now, but I've tried to remember that other woman's name. I used to go to both their plays because they were in plays immediately at LSU, and I used to go see them in plays. Which I loved plays, and they would get me tickets and get me in and stuff. Kay Hodges was more of the Janis Joplin type. She was always having some dramatic panic. The other one had the appearance of calm and control, but it was still in drama. They were just fascinating. I could tell that my race really was irrelevant to them, and I enjoyed them because they were . . . I was so fascinated by them than anything. I wanted to dress like the students on campus, not because they were white, but because I was on campus, and I wanted to look like everybody . . . I just wanted to blend in at that point. So I told my parents that everyone was wearing gored skirts, and penny loafers, and oxford shirts-long sleeved, and blush. They wore blush. So, my poor dad, he's so funny. He went out and bought me the best blush you can buy. I had better blush than any of them. I had Revlon. He had heard Revlon. That's it. I'll get her Revlon. So I got nice gored skirts and oxford shirts and penny loafers. I just felt like, "Oh, I know I look like an LSU student." That's all I could see is that I looked like an LSU student. So I walked with the same brisk pace that they all walked with. Because at our school everyone sort of, you sort of shuffled down the halls slightly, you know, but at LSU, everyone had a quick pace. So it was like, I can get this pace, too. I can do that.  4  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A As a result of going to the cafeteria every day, I got to . . . I didn't have private dining, however . . . I went to the communal cafeteria. DEAN: That's a very important question. CRUMP: [141] Yes, yes it was. All of the, listen to this, all of the cooks were black, of course, and I would say hello to all of them as I went through. They loved it. They loved it. At first, they were a little skeptical, come to think of it. One of them was friendly right off, and the head cook, and one down on the other end of the line was friendly, but the others were kind of standoffish waiting, you know. "If she's at LSU, she must think she's better than us." Something in there was there. It hadn't dawned on me to think of myself as better than anyone, and so I would say hello to them because they just . . . it was just, you just always said hello to other blacks, when you were . . . oppression breeds this, you know, especially when they're in a setting where there are few of you. You acknowledge that you know something here, and the hello is just part of that. Eventually, they all became friendly to me. Invariably, someone always sat with me. I was never left alone. DEAN: Really? CRUMP: They always joined me. Sure did. We had male students who worked there. The second semester, I applied for a job on campus, and that's where they put me. In that cafeteria, I loved it. What did I do over there? I think I used to check people in as they came through the line or something. The people who worked there would always sit with me. Some of the male students would sit with me. DEAN: White? CRUMP: Yes, they were all white. Everybody was white except the cooks. And so . . . DEAN: There were, that first year you were there, someplace around twenty-five black undergraduates that I'm aware of. Most of them freshmen. Most of them coming in as you were. CRUMP: [164] I saw them when I went to the Union only. None of them were in any of my classes. They were always studying higher careers than I was. I was studying office administration, studying to be a secretary. It was the only career I knew. I didn't know anything, and I had taken typing in high school. They finally introduced typing in my high school in my senior year, and I had done very well in it. So I thought, "Well this is what I'll take in college." I didn't know anything else. I mean, the other subjects didn't, I didn't know any careers linked to them, like history, English, math, science. I didn't know any careers linked to them. The only careers I knew were teaching, and secretary was kind of a new thought for black women. I didn't know any black secretaries then, but I knew that the field just seemed to be right, because I knew how to type. I went into that study. A very boring field, by the way. Some of the freshman courses were interesting, but when I actually got into the study of secretarial, it was so boring. But I didn't know, I  5  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A just thought I was lazy maybe. I did. How unfortunate. I didn't know how to think very well anyway. I didn't know that I did know how to think but just hadn't had it fostered. And so I didn't see any of the students. I remember meeting a student in the restroom one day, and she said that she heard that I was taking Spanish. I said "Yes, I am." She said, "Well, I'm having an awful time in it. Can you help me out?" And I'm thinking there's nothing you can do to help somebody in a foreign language, and there isn't. There's nothing you can help them with. They've got to do it. But anyway, we ended up talking and I invited her to my dorm room and everything, and we became friends. She told me, she said, "You know, the other students are saying you don't want to associate with them." I said, "Why do they say that? What are they talking about?" She says, "Because you never come to the Union." I said, "Well, I come back to my room between classes." She said, "Well, you know, you could at least drop by the Union." I said, "Why? Just to keep them from talking about me?" I said, "I won't do that." I said, "I'll go to the Union if I want to but not just because they're talking about me." So I went to the Union one day with her, and one of the students in there said, "Well, it's the first time I've seen you in the Union." I thought, "This is the first time I've seen you at all." You know, "What are you talking about? How do you talk to me this way?" So I didn't have much to say to her. I didn't like that, so she and I didn't become friends at all. So of the twenty-five students there, I had one friend. DEAN: Who was it? CRUMP: Her name was Yolanda Laws at the time, and she was from Baton Rouge. She drove to school everyday, and she worked part-time. DEAN: Most of these other students were from Baton Rouge, so they had probably gone to high school together they knew each other already. CRUMP: I think some of them had gone to high school together, yes. I didn't know where a lot of them were from. I really didn't get to know them, but many of them were from Baton Rouge. And I think several of them were from the same schools. Because they hung out in the Union between classes, because where else you going to go between classes. DEAN: Your coffee machine's talking back. CRUMP: [204] Yes, getting in on this. They got to know each other very well and sort of formed a camaraderie which I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to go and isolate myself into a little safe corner of let's be black together. I knew I didn't want to do that because I wanted the university experience. I came there to have the full college experience. I just felt like that's what I had dreamed about, really being fully a college student, and I didn't want to miss anything. I felt like I would have been missing something if I had hung out in safety numbers. That's another thing I learned from my dad, he never hung out in safety numbers. If he went to a large function, I remember he would come back home and say, and he'd been at some function, political function, he'd  6  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A say, "All of those fellows all sat together, but I went and sat over with the white guys." So I guess I learned not to do that thing, not to isolate myself. Even today, I just talked to my vet yesterday, and he was saying, "Well, you know, people always separated themselves in groups, you know, blacks did it." And I thought, blacks didn't do it for the same reason other groups. Other groups did it because they didn't want to associate with them. Blacks did it because no one wanted to associate with them, or they feared no one did. So that's totally different. I don't know what blacks would do if they really had been allowed to choose in this country, so you can't say. So, I knew I wanted to have a full university experience, and I did everything I could to have it. I was Catholic. So I joined the Newman Club right away, and that gave me lots of people to associate with, at least as Catholics. I had that in common with them. I was looking for what I had in common that could get me into the university experience. What I saw from the blacks, they offered me nothing to get me into the university experience because they hung out in the Union all conglomerated together and whatever they did. The girls in the dorm, I had that in common with them, I sat around and talked about the same things they did. I don't remember what it was, now, I guess everything. Mostly light conversation, mostly play and fun. And I listened to them talk about their boyfriends, I didn't have a boyfriend. I had had a boyfriend in high school, but we weren't in contact with each other. [229] He had moved to California. And I met one friend, I think I met her in the cafeteria. She came and sat with me one day. Her name was Donna Howell. I met her very early on. She was from New Mexico, and I really identified with her. We looked related, almost. She was very dark and had dark long hair. But she looked like my relatives, so that's why she looked related to me. We dressed very similar, except she had nicer clothes, but our taste was very similar. She had a low, modulated voice like mine, but she was a singer. She sang very, very well. She was in choirs. The university choir. She was Baptist, so she was in the Baptist student choir and just an incredibly pretty woman. They used to have what they used to call the Bengal Belle of the Week, and she was the first Bengal Belle of the week on campus the semester I came. DEAN: Was this something in the Reveille? CRUMP: The Reveille, yes. They would come out with the Bengal Belle of the Week. I guess we got rid of that in the sixties. You know in the late sixties. DEAN: Right. CRUMP: We're not going to be belles, southern belles, Bengal Belles, or any other kind of belles. Donna and I did everything together. I never remember her looking like someone was going to say she was with a black person. I started becoming aware of who was comfortable being where with me. There were some people who were very comfortable with me in the cafeteria, very comfortable with me in the dorm, but out on campus in the Union, they'd pass me like they'd never seen me before. So I started becoming aware that there was a difference that I had to select who were my friends. I started to learn very fast how to recognize who was my friends. Really my self-esteem  7  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A started to suffer some because some of the people that I really thought were my friends, I didn't want to think that they didn't fully embrace me as a friend. And that would hurt a lot. But it hurt in a way, unfortunately, that made me feel like there was something wrong with me, something wrong with being black, but it was never spoken. You know, people think, it's funny, whites often think that the worst thing that can happen to a black is to be yelled a racial slur at. PLEASE give me racial slurs. You know, just don't give me a friend who ignores me in public. You know, a friend who embraced me intimately and then get in public and she's never seen me before. Give me racial slurs over that. I think that that's probably true for most blacks. We don't care that Ross Perot said "You people" it doesn't mean anything, you know, that's nothing. So . . . DEAN: Was this the first time you had had to deal with this kind of racial prejudice? CRUMP: Yes, it was, it was, because when, yes, it was in that way . . . the only other racial prejudice I had dealt with was white people at home who just didn't speak to you at all, who kept their distance from you. That was it. Or you saw "White Only" signs, or that sort of thing, but directly where people just . . . I had never seen people who look at you like you didn't exist once they've known you. These people at home had done this across the board, but I had never known anyone who could sit and talk with you and the next time they see you, look right through you. Blacks don't do that. They may now, but from when I was coming up, there was no such thing. If blacks didn't like you, they wanted you to know they didn't like you, and they would give you a sign and turn their heads. You know, they would obviously let you know, "I'm angry with you. I don't like you." They made a statement out of it which is great because then you know where they're coming from. But I wasn't used to people who could look like they had not even registered your presence. I had never seen that before. That was the coldest, most painful thing that I had ever experienced. I knew that I could never learn it, and was sure that I didn't want to, but kind of wondered if I didn't need it. I finally met some friends from New Orleans, the Barberito sisters, Janel and Mary Barberito, and they were very, very nice to me and very helpful. Didn't treat me like a black friend, you know. We went everywhere together, mostly Janel and I, because Mary lived further away, I think. Mary came the second semester, I believe, but anyway. DEAN: Was Janel in your dormitory or one of your classes? How did you meet her? CRUMP: I don't remember how I met Janel, but I think she was in a nearby dorm in that horseshoe. Yes, she was. So I don't remember how I met her. DEAN: [299] Were they your first white, southern friends? CRUMP: Well, Donna Howell was. DEAN: No, she's New Mexico. She's not southern.  8  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A CRUMP: Oh, southern, yes. Yes, the Barberitos. That's right. They were from New Orleans. Then I met a friend from Mississippi named Becky, and I don't remember Becky's last name. But Becky was friends with Donna, and that's how I met Becky. When Donna told me she wanted me to meet Becky, and Becky was from Mississippi, I said, "I don't think I want to meet her, Donna." She says, "Oh, no, Becky's really nice." When I met Becky, Becky says, "Look." Becky was the first person who spoke directly to me about race. From Mississippi! She says, "I hate Mississippi and all that it stands for." I thought, "Really?" She was blonde! She wasn't very pretty, though. Becky wasn't very pretty. She was kind of gawky and tall. DEAN: Didn't qualify for southern belle? CRUMP: Right, right. I met no southern belles. I met no southern belles. They did not associate with me. They said, "Hi, how are you," type thing and kept going, or they would give me a quick smile. But there was no relationship with them, ever. They never connected with me. Can't think of one. I had Jewish friends, New Orleanians are a little different sometimes. By the way these two New Orleanians, the Barberitos, you can tell by their name, they were Italians. I didn't meet any WASPS. I didn't meet any WASPS. They definitely kept their distance, but they kept it in a way that I was almost unaware that they were keeping their distance because like I said, I wasn't used to really being around people who looked like they had never seen you. I thought if they looked like they hadn't seen me it was because they didn't for a long time, until I had people that I had been friendly with that when I saw them out changed on me. I didn't, still didn't, connect those people who were not looking at me as people who hadn't seen me. I thought they didn't see me. So I didn't even get the invisible syndrome -- which is what I think you get when people ignore you -- because I didn't know they were ignoring me. I thought they didn't see me. You know, well, there's lots of people around they just don't see me. DEAN: You really took it at face value. CRUMP: [322] Yes, I did. I didn't examine it. It was so unfamiliar to me. Then the Newman Club, everybody was nice. I don't remember knowing where everybody was from, but I remember being asked thousands of times a day, "Where are you from?" I heard that more times than I ever thought I could hear it in my life, "Where are you from?" "Oh, you're from here!" That was the reaction. "Oh, you're from Louisiana!" I finally realized it was because I lived on campus it was like, if you live on campus you must not live nearby where you can drive here, because otherwise you wouldn't live in this dorm. So they would ask me all the time, "Where are you from?" All the time. I felt like a lot of the treatment I got was because I was the only one. I felt like if there had been one other black student on campus, especially in my dorm area, I would have been forced with her, and then they would have shut us both out. Whereas when there's one, I just think it's easier. I think it's best to have a large enough group or one. Two or three is devastating to any type of mixing, so they almost, I guess, thought they were doing me a favor sometimes which is fine. Do me a favor. Be my friend. I need somebody to talk to. I used to go home about every two weeks. Some weekends I'd stay  9  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A on campus and go to the Newman Club. I used to have to work for friendship there. I had never worked for friendship before. It just sort of, you know, I had grown up with all these people. I actually had to go up and say hello to people and ask them questions. It took a little work. I didn't mind it. I saw that I had to work a little harder than other people to make friends. Some people who reached out to me in the Newman Club were doing the, "I'm going to reach out to you because you're black," and those friendships weren't friendships. I had nothing in common with these people. They said nothing I could relate to. They didn't try to get to know me. They just had me as "black." And so I didn't have much in common with them, so that didn't go very far. Finally, I would meet some people in the Newman Club that I could be friends with, that would talk to Maxine. One of them was in the choir, and I said, "Well, I used to be in the church choir at home." They said, "Well, come join us." So I joined the student center choir, and I enjoyed that because anyway I had another group to be in. I went to the LSU games, even by myself. DEAN: You did go by yourself? CRUMP: [371] Yes, sure did. I went by myself up until I think, the second semester. I had met Pat Kennison, who was from Gonzales. Was not a southern belle, by far, although her family is more the French-Cajun type. She was very different. She was boyish and laughed aloud and clowned and cut up. Then I met Marie Biendeau and her sister, I've forgotten her sister's name right now. Of course, they're Italians, too, and they were from Baton Rouge. These were my friends. The Biendeaus had a Jeep that we would go riding in, a convertible Jeep, which was fun. So I got to do those kind of wild college things. It was like, "Ooh, this is being in college!" Riding in a Jeep with the top off of it. Going to get malts, I had never gone to go get malts. My mother was always, "I don't want you hanging around the malt shop. People are going to say I'm just letting you run wild." It was like, "I'm running wild. I'm having a malt!" DEAN: Where did you go for malts? CRUMP: At the pharmacist right off of campus. It was a Rex- All drug store, it was called Tigertown Pharmacy. And I remember there seemed to have been a time where there was a question about whether I could sit at the counter, but I did. But they didn't know I was black because the Italian girls were dark, too. So they didn't know. I did a lot of things that way with my dark white friends because they were almost my color. We would go in places where they didn't know I was black, and they would say, "They don't know you're black!" So a lot of the places I went were like that. A lot. DEAN: How did you feel about that? CRUMP: I felt that if I had been discovered, I would have been embarrassed. If they had said, you know, "You can't because you're black." I just felt like I would have been embarrassed to be thrown out. DEAN: Did you think about it at the time?  10  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A CRUMP: Yes. Yes I did. Yes, but it didn't stop me from having a good time. I thought about it, and I went on and had a good time. But I was aware of it. DEAN: [407] Did you have any sense that passing that way was in any sense a betrayal of your race or that you should have been confronting this rather than just getting away with it, so to speak? Did you feel that way at all? Did that ever occur to you? CRUMP: I knew that I didn't have what it takes to confront it then. I knew that in a way I was passing, but I knew that I wasn't choosing to pass. I was letting it pass. I wasn't saying, "I'm going to go in here and pretend to be white." If anyone had asked me, I would have acknowledged being black, absolutely, I knew that. I knew I'd be honest about it, and I knew that the other blacks on campus would have scoffed at it, totally. I knew that from my friend Yolanda. That they would have said that I wanted this. But what I wanted was the full college experience, and if it meant going in those places they went, then I wanted to go in those places because they were college students, not because they were white. About two years after being there at the university, after they had a large onslaught of blacks come in, and blacks couldn't go in all those places right off campus, then the university issued a statement that said: "You will serve all LSU students, or you will move your business." Then we could go in everywhere, but I was thrown out of one place when I went with some other blacks to a place I had gone to when they didn't know. I went in that same place, and it was the Bengal, no, the Pastime. They came over immediately and said, "We don't serve coloreds here." DEAN: Was this part of a deliberate attempt to desegregate these places? CRUMP: It was. I knew what I was doing. I knew that they didn't accept blacks. DEAN: Was there a larger movement among the students to do sit-ins, to picket, to . . . CRUMP: Yes, I think there was . . . DEAN: . . . force desegregation . . . CRUMP: Yes, there was at that time. DEAN: So you were an active part of that. CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: And this would have been, what? Sixty-six, sixty-seven, someplace around there. CRUMP: [447] More like sixty-seven, yes. Yes, because it was really two years later when a lot of blacks came from Shreveport and Bogalusa where the blacks were more active in their own hometowns. Those from Baton Rouge and Plaquemine and where I 11  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A came from, we didn't come from strongly activist communities. But when they started coming in from Bogalusa and Shreveport and New Orleans, then we had activism among the blacks on campus, and we started forming organizations and making a difference. The university started listening to us a little more. DEAN: Yes, it was sixty-seven, sixty-eight that we start getting Black Power and then of course, with Martin Luther King's assassination in the spring of sixty-eight, I think it was. DEAN: Yes, and so things started to change on campus, and then I had some black friends, finally. It was difficult because I had black friends, and I still had white friends. I almost had to sort of associate with them alternately, separately. DEAN: Was there pressure from your black friends, from the black student community as a whole to be militant and not associate with . . . CRUMP: That's right. There was, but I had found that I was learning a lot from whites about how life works in this society. I knew how life worked in the black community, but I did not know how life worked in the society. I found out that there were things I had to know, things I had to be connected to if I ever wanted to go anywhere in this society. I couldn't just be black, I knew that, and just do what the black culture did because I wanted the opportunities that everybody else had. I always felt I was entitled to them because my parents said I was. They didn't say it with any if and's about it. I believed that, and it just made sense to me that I had rights to all of this, and I didn't feel like a militant for feeling that way. It just felt normal to me that I should be able to get any opportunity that anybody else could get. I didn't see enough difference. I didn't see where because I was black I shouldn't be able to do it. I just didn't get that. I didn't get it. I saw that they had the edge. They were on the inside, and I wanted to be on the inside and learn from them. I used to go to the coffee houses with them, so I was a part of both movements. I was a part of the Black Power movement, the black civil rights movement, and I was also a part of the peace movement. I had no interest in getting to know the southern belles in the sororities. That seemed to be going nowhere to me. That was another way of belonging in the society that was very big and very important, but it didn't fit me. I knew that if I had to do that to fit in, forget it. I'll dig holes and live underground first. I was totally turned off by the ribbons, and the matching socks and the plaid shorts. Well, they weren't shorts then. They were skirts. We didn't get to the pants until sixty-seven. DEAN: Women were still not allowed to wear slacks on campus until then. CRUMP: No, that's right, sixty-seven, yes. DEAN: Dress codes. CRUMP: Yes. Dress codes were a big deal.  12  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side A DEAN: Let me turn this tape over.  [End Tape 204 Side A. Begin Tape 204, Side B.] DEAN: [20] I'd like to go back later on and talk a little bit more about some of those rules for women and so forth that we all lived under in that period, but I want to pick up on something you were saying about being part of the peace movement as well as the Black Power movement. The Catholic Student Center was, and, and the priests at the, at the Catholic church or chapel, whatever it was on campus, were very active in both civil rights and the peace movements. CRUMP: Yes, there were some terrific priests there. DEAN: Can you, can you tell me a little bit about that aspect of the, of the Catholic Student Center and those priests. CRUMP: The priest that was there when I came there was your traditional Catholic priest, reminded me very much of our hometown priest. But within a year . . . DEAN: Now your hometown priest, you said, had been black, is that right? CRUMP: Yes, one of them. DEAN: Ok. CRUMP: But traditional as a priest. DEAN: Do, do you remember his name? CRUMP: The black priest? DEAN: No, the, the one on campus. CRUMP: Father Brew(?) DEAN: Father . . . CRUMP: Brew(?) DEAN: Brew(?) CRUMP: [30] I don't remember any others until Michael Cody came, and he was the most phenomenal priest I had ever met because he talked about real life practical things. 13  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B He wore cool robes. I mean, they had a flair to them. They looked like they were designed for his personality. He didn't wear the traditional thing. His was an all-in-one robe. They used to have the layers. They'd have the white thing under with a belt tied on and then the other thing over it. Well he just wore this one robe with a hood on it and a belt. It looked good on him. He was a good looking man. Young, strong neck, looked like he worked out, and you could see his neck because it wasn't all bailed up. I thought, "This is neat. This is so down." In the sixties, we were really getting into letting go of the establishment tightness. DEAN: Right. CRUMP: And so here was a priest who, who walked down off the altar and sort of swayed around when he talked and wore this real cool robe and was good-looking and young, and who said these things that with, with no fear that, that really connected with us. We got rid of the choir loft, and we started the guitar singing. We brought it down into the chapel and started singing cool songs in church, and girls became ushers and altar servers. It was wonderful. I thought, "This is the way Catholics should be." I thought, "Gee, my parents would love this." Well they . . . it was like, "Not really. Okay fine, you do your thing, this is what I like." I was having a lot of fun with it, and it seemed like I knew that anytime I went in that church that anyone I sat next to welcomed me. I knew that there was no such thing as, "I better check and see if I can sit next to this person," because it seemed like only cool people came there. They were involved in the peace movement. The Newman Center invited students from Southern to do programs and social things with them and that sort of thing. DEAN: Were there any of the faculty that were involved in, who came to the church, were involved in any of the peace activities? CRUMP: Not that I was aware of. DEAN: So it was the priest, Father Cody, and the students. CRUMP: [57] And the students. We started a coffee house. We put parachutes in the top of the hall, and we would just come over there and drink coffee and talk about life, you know, and situations and issues and the world. I would listen to all these people with these thoughts and these opinions and plans, and it was like I was in the middle of life happening. I was no longer on the outside looking in, hoping to be in. I had found a way in. Part of the was that I found to be in was to listen, to be friendly, and pick my battles. There were things I stood on. There were lots of things I let pass. It was like, "I don't know why they're saying this," because then I started to find that even the people in the peace movement had little idea of what black was like. You don't know unless you're black, and it still remains. They meant well, but they had little idea. I was very surprised at that. Then there were those that I would actually talk to who would tell me I was wrong. Whites would tell me that I was wrong about what blackness is. And I'm thinking . . . "Could I be?" Really! I would think, "Could I be?" because they seemed so smart and so knowledgeable, and they could put it in such logical terms to show me where it really  14  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B didn't make any difference, you know. People would talk about disliking a person because of the color of their skin, and I used to think, "It's more than skin color that they don't like." That may be what is the most obvious distinction, but the dislike list is a lot longer than color. But no one ever spoke it, and I used to think, "Well, maybe it's just you, Maxine, maybe you just think this." It's like, no, no, which one of them would choose my hair. None. It wasn't until years later that I asked someone that, you know. You say you'd love to be my color because I always get people who say, "Ooh, I'd love to be your color. I'd love to get a tan." I'd say, "Yes, but you wouldn't like to be black. You'd just like your white skin to be my color because you wouldn't choose my hair. Maybe some other things about me that looks black you wouldn't want it. You don't want to look black because you don't want the problem." And I understand that. So as a result, they would think that I didn't want the problem, but they were wrong. I didn't want to be white. I just wanted to have everything whites had. I was walking with a friend one day, and she told me that she would (Years later, she told me that she told this to every class she taught. She was a teacher, Miss Pat Kennison from Gonzales.) She was short, shorter than me, and had short legs. I'm not very tall, but my legs are long. We were walking. She had on heels, and I didn't. So you can imagine I was out- striding her. And she would say, "Slow down, Max." I'd slow down, and after a while, I had left her again. And she'd say, "Slow down!" After a while it happened again, and she stopped, and she says, "Max, if you don't . . .," because we were walking on Highland, where cars were passing and things, she said, "If you don't slow down, people are going to think I don't want to walk with you." She tells this, I had totally forgotten it, she said, "And you stopped and turned around and put one hand on your hip and you said, 'They might think I don't want to walk with you.'" She said, "Boy, was I humbled." So I really did see myself, I was perfectly fine with my color. [94] There were times when I had a little difficulty explaining my hair because at the time I didn't have a permanent relaxer in it. I used to get my hair hot combed, and in swimming I wore a cap. Well, all of us had to wear caps in swimming, but we still got our hair wet anyway, and afterward they had blowers in the, in the gym. The girls would all go and blow their hair under these dryers, and I would think, "This doesn't quite serve me, because when I blow mine it's going to just be wild." I would dry it some, and I found that I could get it to work some because unless I really washed it with soap it didn't lose all of its straightening. But it didn't look like theirs. I was a little conscious that they may have been criticizing my hair. No one ever seemed to, but that they may have been thinking it was odd. I remember one day I said to Pat that I needed to get my hair done, and she said . . . no, she said . . . something, it was something came up about the hair . . . and I said . . . needing to get it done or something, and she said, "Well, I've got conditioner. Doesn't it just need conditioning?" I said, "No!" I said, "I straighten my hair!" She says, "Why would you straighten your hair? It doesn't look curly to me." I said, "It's not curly. It's kinky." "You don't have kinky hair." I said, "That's because it's straightened now." They just couldn't understand that, and that was uncomfortable for me to have to explain. I didn't want to have to explain my hair. I wasn't comfortable with that. And, that sort of thing. Then I remember thinking, "Well, gee, if I was dark, I would have to explain why my makeup color was different than theirs." Because really they  15  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B could borrow my makeup, some of them, you know, and that sort of thing, and they did. I could use theirs sometimes if they weren't really fair, and so that made it easy for me, in a way. They just couldn't understand my hair. DEAN: We were all spending so much time getting ours curled. CRUMP: Yes, and I used to . . . DEAN: Or by then, I guess, maybe we were in to ironing it CRUMP: Yes, you were in to ironing it. That's right. I remember asking one white friend, "Why is it I know so much about you, and you know so little about me?" I didn't know at the time that it is the nature of oppression, you know. All blacks knew whites better that whites knew blacks. Whites had no reason to get to know blacks other than the way they needed to know. But as friends, they had never had a need to really relate oneon- one. I met a friend named Ciel the next semester, Ceil Brown, and we became good friends. Ceil asked me to spend the night at her house. It was between semesters, and my dad brought me to campus because Dad didn't know where they lived, and my dad brought me to campus and her dad picked me up. We went out to the house, and they were so impressed to show their friends that their daughter had a black friend visiting. I didn't know that was such a big deal because I had lived with Ceil on campus, but in the home it was different. To have a black friend sleeping overnight in your home was a big deal. I didn't know that. I found out then, and I kind of enjoyed that part of the specialness. In my family's home, we didn't think of it as a big deal, you know. Ceil had asked me to come stay at her house, and my parents thought, "Well, isn't that nice?" but that was about it. But her family brought in friends to introduce and they were just, "Well, hi!" you know, it's like, "Hi." Amazing to me. But I learned so much, there [at LSU], things I never, never knew that I came there to learn . . . never knew. Our dorm mother was named Mrs. MacDougal. [137] She was an old southern white lady, surely and old southern belle, but she treated me so well. As I look back, I think part of it was Miss Mac was old enough not to care about all of that. She didn't have to worry about it. She treated me just fine. And I really liked her, and all the girls liked Miss Mac. I just remember my parents liked her too because she always spoke so well of me when they came. Oh, that's what they wanted to hear. "Maxine never gives me any trouble." They felt safe having me there. And I was also so very impressed with how well LSU had prepared for their students to live compared to Southern. I had been in the dorms at Southern because I had been there for an overnight program of some type when I was in high school. The dorms, I thought, were horrendous. Just horrendous! The rooms were just so ill-prepared and ill-equipped and poorly laid out, just such ugly dorms. I didn't really want to live there. And a phone in the hall. Things like that. We had this solidly built dorm, built out of the best of things in this beautiful setting among trees and magnolias and azaleas and camellias, crepe myrtles, all of that in this one area. Wellheated, well-lighted. We didn't have air conditioning then, but it was designed for great  16  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B air flow. So I was basically very comfortable there even in the summer because of all the trees and the big windows they had. And a phone in my room. My own phone. "How can they afford this?" I wondered. So I was very, very pleased with how well- equipped we were, how fine the cafeterias were, how the meals were always exactly on time. We had everything. They served us everything. I thought the food was delicious. The other girls used to say it was horrible food. It took me about two semesters to decide cafeteria food's at least tiring, but at first it was exciting to get up in the morning and have breakfast done. It's not that I didn't have that at home, because my mother did but certainly not that kind of layout. I gained seventeen pounds my first year, eating three full meals a day with all . . . with desserts every meal or something with sugar in it every meal. But then the next year, I got it off real fast because after I started taking swimming . . . two semesters of swimming. And I got back down, I lost . . . well, no, I lost only seven of those pounds because I came in very underweight. I needed to gain about ten pounds. Then I lost seven, and I stayed at that weight. At that time, it was a beautiful weight for me, and it looked, it looked really good. Because I was working out, because I remember some of the white students used to say, "Your legs are so firm!" You know, "How do you do that?" And I said, "Well, I take swimming" and everything, but it wasn't just that . . . it was kind of genetic, you know, the firmness was. But I had never noticed that, I thought, "Geez, you all have everything, what could I have that you don't have?" Then they started noticing things that I had that they liked, like eyebrows. At that time, that needed no pencil, eyelashes that needed no mascara, things that they didn't have they started to admire on me. I thought, "This is exciting! I've got something white people want!" And I had a behind . . . DEAN: Including a perfect tan. CRUMP: Yes, they liked my perfect tan. They liked the fact that I had a behind, and they liked my eyelashes and my eyebrows, that sort of thing. Things I hadn't thought much about, they liked. Yes, it felt pretty good. DEAN: [187] Let's talk for a minute about all those - -since we're on sort of feminine topics right at the moment -- all of those rules, checking in and out and, and so forth that you had to live with. CRUMP: It's the reason that I was able to live on campus because my parents liked them. So at first, they were a blessing to me because they gave me the opportunity to live on campus. DEAN: What were the closing hours? Do you remember? CRUMP: Something like ten during the week and twelve on Fridays and maybe onethirty on Saturdays. I'm not sure if that was that freshman year or the next year . . . may have been the next year. They were pretty strict closing hours, and you got in trouble if you didn't . . . you got demerits, you couldn't leave the dorm if you had blown those. I think I may have done that a couple of times, ended up having . . . or either I knew  17  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B someone who did, and I ended up staying in with them . . . I think I had to stay in a couple of times. DEAN: Who set these penalties? Do you remember? Who set and enforced those kind of things? CRUMP: The house mother enforced them, but they were set by the university housing. DEAN: This was an administrative thing. CRUMP: Yes, and they got to be . . . if you signed out, if you were going to go out of town, you had to get permission from your parents, so I knew that was out. I never even asked for permission from my parents. But when my sister came two years later, she would sign out and just go. They didn't know where she was. She'd go to New Orleans or whatever. She wasn't about to ask parents, and I never even thought of that. Never even thought of breaking that rule. I thought my parents might look for me or ask . . . I never would have been comfortable being in New Orleans having just signed out regular when I didn't have . . . because I was given limited permission. There were those who had what they called general permission, and they could go out of town on the weekend, but I couldn't unless my parents signed. I think I kept limited permission that whole year. I don't know if I had it the next year when they moved me to the French House, which is another exclusive dorm. And I was given another private room. DEAN: [216] Tell me about the French House. CRUMP: It was a lovely place, just lovely, small amount of students so I got to know them all . . . that's where I met Ceil Brown. DEAN: Now, where these local students or foreign students, mostly in the French House? CRUMP: Local. I think at one time it used to be for foreign students, but it wasn't. DEAN: Was it a co-ed dorm at this point? CRUMP: No, no. There were no co-ed dorms when I was there. DEAN: I know at one point French House was co-educational and primarily international students. CRUMP: Oh, I see. But I think because this was baby boom, they had to just use every available space they could, yet I had a private room. A little cubby hole at the top of the stairs, once again. I walked those stairs and walked into my room, and it was like a little loft. It had a little portal window. The only room like it in the whole dorm because all the rooms were different in the French House. I was given this little loft, and the bathroom  18  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B was directly around the corner. I mean I'd just walk out of the room, and it was right there. I think I must have shared it. I'm not sure. DEAN: Do you remember if there were other rooms on that floor? CRUMP: Yes, there was one in the corner, but I don't remember those people. There was one other room up there, and I don't remember who stayed there. They must not have made an impression on me. DEAN: Was there still dining in the French House, or did you still go . . . ? CRUMP: No, I had to go to the cafeteria. We went to another cafeteria, then. The upperclass cafeteria. DEAN: So this was your sophomore or junior year? CRUMP: Sophomore. DEAN: Sophomore year. Did you live on campus the whole four years? CRUMP: No, I lived on campus until my sister and I moved into an apartment. DEAN: I have to take a break. CRUMP: Oh, indeed. DEAN: It's, it's the coffee . . . again. CRUMP: [241] Well, you were asking me about the strict codes, and one of the strict codes were that you had to wear dresses everywhere . . . to class. I mean, you could wear slacks in the game room. DEAN: This is in the dormitory, is it, or? CRUMP: No, at the Union. DEAN: At the Union. CRUMP: And that was, I believe, on weekends. I don't remember how we got to the game room in these slacks. I guess we could walk across campus in them, but we could not be seen out of the game room. It was like you wore pants, you went to the game room, you came home, you changed. I believe that's the way it was. But you could not wear them to class. Just out in the Union and everything. I guess I just kind of accepted it as a university rule until the students started to complain about it and how inconvenient it was for us. Then it started to make sense to me that this rule doesn't make any sense. When they decided, they had dorm meetings, which was another exciting thing about 19  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B being in the dorm because the dorm girls would get together and do things like rally around candidates at election. They would decorate at homecoming, and they would just get together and talk about things on campus and the way the university worked, and there was really not much of a forum for that if you lived off campus. DEAN: Was there a house committee or something? Did that body make any kind of rules for the dormitory? Was there any scope for that sort of thing in that system? CRUMP: I don't know that it made rules for the dormitory, but it planned things to happen at the dormitory. We agreed to participate in certain things and support certain things, but for the actual inside of the dorm, we had enough rules already -- didn't need to make any new ones. We used to have room check after closing hours. DEAN: Who did that? CRUMP: One of the students. She would be like a hall monitor or something and she would just come in and say, "Room check." She may open your door, or she just may yell in. They got to where if they knew you well enough they just yelled in and you answered back. DEAN: Making sure everybody was in. CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: Was there somebody checking you in when you came in in the evening? CRUMP: No, you just signed in, but then they did room check afterwards. But anyway, when they decided the deal about wearing the pants on campus, we all met in different dorms, and they came around and made speeches to us. I don't remember where house mothers were. I don't remember whether they agreed to let us gather in the lobby to talk about this or whether we just did it because it was students talking to us. DEAN: Were they official representatives of student government or anything like that? CRUMP: No, no. Just concerned women students. DEAN: That started raising this issue. CRUMP: That's right, just rebel-rousers, I suppose. They said, "What will the university do if we all just show up in pants at the Union tomorrow?" Oh, that sounded exciting, and so I was going to be with that group! So we did, and of course then the rule was changed instantly. We just converged on them. It was one of the best movements that happened on campus while I was there. Because many times there were movements attempted on campus that the university just put down, and I saw the power of the university then. I thought, "How can these wonderful ideas that I see these students have ever become a  20  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B part of society or ever make a rule change at this university because then the semester ends and any movement is killed." The administration knew how to wait us out. DEAN: Is there an example you can think of of one of these cases where you tried to do something and you couldn't? CRUMP: Let's see, there was something we wanted on campus, what was it that we fought for? We held a vigil. I wasn't actually in that, but there was something that students actually went and sat outside the administrative offices and things like that. The university just didn't budge and didn't have to, and at the end of the semester, it was over. It was something, some sort of activism that we wanted. It was during the sixties movement, type thing, and I'm sorry I can't remember what it was. But I know that whatever it was, the university just waited us out. Thanks to David Duke, who used to stand on the steps of the Union and hold arguments with people until crowds would gather around him, espousing his beliefs on white supremacy. It drew a lot of attention from black students arguing with him, white liberals arguing with him. The university was very embarrassed by this, and they couldn't stop him, though. David Duke knew they could do nothing about this. The Union was public, and the first amendment was on his side. So the university answered that by designating Free Speech Alley. When I told them that at Channel Nine, when I said when David Duke ran, I said, "Well, David Duke started with the reason Free Speech Alley was started." They said, "No one ever said this. I didn't know this." I said, "They weren't at the university, maybe. You're talking to someone who was there. I know he did." They checked it out and found out it was true and used that in their news story on him. The only station that did because they were the only ones who had Maxine Crump. But anyway, yes, that's how that started. I started to really like the activism, and by then I was starting to understand what activism was about. I was starting to understand what civil rights were about. I was starting to understand some women's rights, in a little way, not as strongly as I was civil rights. It seemed to be the bigger issue at the time. Then when the women's movement started, some of the men said, black men in particular, said that the women's movement was started to dismantle the civil rights movement. I don't think it's true. I think they went hand-in-hand, and they needed to stay hand-in-hand because they couldn't stay hand-inhand, both were disbanded. Even though activism made sense to me and I was a part of activism, I ran into trouble with blacks because I didn't wear dashiki. I didn't like the way they looked, so I didn't wear them. I didn't like the way they looked on me. I liked seeing other people wear them, and I liked the thought of them. But on me, I just didn't like them. DEAN: How about an Afro? CRUMP: I didn't wear an Afro because it looked like a boring haircut to me. I couldn't style it. It's just one shape, and so that's why I didn't wear that. To be honest, I also knew that I would lose some of my white friends if I wore an Afro because they would have a  21  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B hard time with it. They would have taken it as a radical statement against them. However, if I had been stronger, I would have worn it and just let them go if that was what the friendship meant. But it was like I thought I needed that connection. Then basically, though, I still was aware that I didn't like the Afro because even later, when I wasn't friends with as many whites, wasn't as in contact with them, I still didn't want to wear one. I saw it was damaging to the hair, and I already had very fine hair, easily damaged. So I didn't want to wear it for that reason, too. I didn't feel that that was how I needed to express my activism, necessarily. I thought it was fine for those who did. I was glad people felt free to wear their hair in a natural because they didn't call them Afros at first, they called them naturals. Afro was a name given to them by whites. So I never wore an Afro, but I was involved in activism. But I wanted to be in real activism. I didn't just want to be radical or militant. DEAN: Was there any particular activities that you were involved in? Incidents that you think of being involved in? CRUMP: [355] I was in Harambe, which was a black student group on campus. DEAN: How did that come about? CRUMP: It was a group of male students, and I don't remember quite how they formed. But I remember being contacted immediately. One of the students that was there was Rap Brown's brother, Lance Brown, and he was one of the originators of Harambe. DEAN: Was that a group unique to LSU or was that something . . . CRUMP: Yes, it wasn't nationwide. They formed it there, and we met in the Union in one of the, I guess, community meeting rooms. We talked about issues. I don't really remember exactly what issues we talked about. There was so much going on then. There were so many issues everywhere . . . I just don't remember. DEAN: Well, some of the things I know that came up at various times in sixty-seven, sixty-eight, was the issue of recruiting black athletes, recruiting black faculty, do you remember any specific efforts in that direction? CRUMP: They were talking about how to get the black students participating in more of the functions on campus. That was one of the discussions. It wasn't so much recruiting black students for things and recruiting black faculty, but how could we be involved in more campus functions, and that sort of thing. Because actually, we weren't involved. I had been involved in more than any of the students had been because I had been in the dorm and in the Newman Center and there early on campus and I had infiltrated, so to speak, a lot of things that they wouldn't have allowed me if I had been more obviously black and if it had been more blacks. Then I started to really realize how the other black students were being shut out and how I had now truly experienced how black students were being treated on campus fully. Then I started to become aware that I wanted to make a difference in that area. I didn't want to just enjoy the privileges and be able to get  22  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B away with the lighter color. That I wanted the university to really change, to really take responsibility for its students, all of its students and not have this separating idea. Also, the jobs on campus, certain jobs we didn't get on campus. If you were a black student, you got relegated to filing books in the back room. You never got any out-front jobs. I was in the cafeteria, and I was in the speech department, but I was always in a closed-away office. DEAN: Interesting. CRUMP: Yes, and they had some nice jobs on campus for students. There was no chance of me getting it, but I didn't know that at the time. Yes, I didn't know why I wasn't getting the good jobs on campus. I never gave it a thought until we started having Harambe and discussing those type things. DEAN: So your consciousness was being raised. CRUMP: [407] Very definitely. Finally, we elected the first black student government president, Kerry Pourciau. You'll probably interview him. As I look back, I can say he was a safe bet. He was selected by the whites to be an okay black. DEAN: In what sense was . . . CRUMP: He didn't cause any trouble. He proved that there were some better black people that were deserving of being with white people . . . barf. DEAN: What had he done to demonstrate that he was a safe . . . CRUMP: He made good grades, and he got along well with whites. He didn't say anything antagonistic. DEAN: Was he a member of Harambe or anything like that? CRUMP: Not that I recall. I don't think he was, but he was a very bright, optimistic student. He had a very positive attitude. But I think he had been programmed, like a lot of us were when we first came there, to show whites that all blacks are not bad. That's shifted for me. I recognize that I didn't have to prove anything. They needed to prove to me that all whites weren't bad, you know, if we are going to do any proving here. Who are they that I should prove anything to them, and so I felt that he had not unlearned that. He still did that, and he did it very well, to the point of acceptance, and I found out that there are several ways of getting into the system. In a way, I had participated like he did by being the right kind of black, but I wasn't aware of being it because I needed white endorsement. I was aware of it from him. I saw myself as needing to be on the inside to get the full university experience. Maybe he was doing the same thing I was doing, but it looked to me that he was trying to impress white people that this is how some blacks are, and I'm not like the others. So they said, "Great! We'll, we'll reward you. We need, we  23  Crump, Maxine - Tape 204, Side B need to run you for SGA president because we need to make a statement to the university." There were some liberal students who needed a black student to make that statement with, and they did have to choose one that whites would vote for. They were able to make it Kerry, and it was very popular at the time for the university to show itself in that way. They did, and they voted for him. I mean, they wouldn't have voted for Lance Brown. [Laughs] DEAN: [458] You were at LSU when Martin Luther King was assassinated. Tell me, do you remember about that? Hearing about it, and, and what the student response and administration response to that was? CRUMP: I think the actual date that he was killed, I wasn't on campus because I had flunked out. I think I wasn't there because I know I would remember more of what actually happened on campus. I remember sitting in the dorm, in my junior year or earlier, watching a program on tv with Martin Luther King, and I was the only one watching it. I don't remember what that occasion was, but I remember feeling a little uncomfortable, at first, and then discomfort doesn't matter here, this is important to me. People passing didn't even say hello. It was like it wasn't, it wasn't even okay to associate with me if I was going to watch that. I was just aware of almost being in a time warp with that. That stands out more to me than actually what was going on in the program, is how I was being treated for sitting in a lobby actually watching it. So in order to ignore the program there, they ignored me, too. No one even said hello. DEAN: That was too militant? CRUMP: I think it was. DEAN: Well, let's see . . . what else . . . CRUMP: Well, the class work. The class work was unlike high school in every way, and I don't know if it was that unlike it for other students. I think partly because I came from a small town, partly because I was from an all-black high school, and partly because just college is different. I didn't know which was which, but I found that the professors extremely knowledgeable and interesting, but I didn't quite understand them. DEAN: Let me just . . .  24	Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections			Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )									Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

Transcript Crump 205A										Narrator: Maxine Crump 4700.0117 Interviewer: Pamela Dean Session II Transcriber: Barrett Campbell 14 July 1992 [End Tape 204, Side B. Begin Tape 205, Side A.] DEAN: [005] Okay. CRUMP: I didn't have a clue as to how to study in college. It was different than what I needed to study in high school. It was different in how I needed to prepare for tests. Because in high school, we were usually asked a lot of multiple choice questions, it seemed, and we rarely had to write out an answer to a question. When we did, it was a fact we had to answer. It wasn't very much thinking involved, as I recall it. I got to the university, and we had to think. Well, I wasn't used to that. I didn't know how to do that, quite, so I didn't know how to prepare for tests. I did not do well in Spanish because I had never taken a foreign language. But my instructor was fascinated with my ability to pronounce the words, and she said, "You pronounce the words so well, and you hear the sounds so well." She says, "If you'll will come to my office twenty minutes before class, I will tutor you." I did, and I don't even think I came very long, and my grades turned around totally. I mean, I went from an "F" to an "A", so I got a "B" out of the course. DEAN: Who was the professor, do you remember? CRUMP: I don't remember her name . . . I sure don't. Lovely woman. DEAN: Do you recall was she a full professor or instructor or graduate student, or . . . CRUMP: She was not a graduate student. She was either instructor or full professor, and she was a very, very heavy woman. Soft skin that looked peachy, northern accent. DEAN: Did you sense that she was taking an interest in you because you were black, and she wanted to encourage you? CRUMP: No. DEAN: Or simply that you had the potential. CRUMP: Didn't sense it at all. Yes. If it was because I was black, I'm glad, but I didn't know that. I thought she just sensed the potential, and she was right. I had that same potential for every class I took, but I did not have another professor like her. Had I had a little bit more of the tutoring that she gave I would have, then I would have made very good grades and would have graduated in four years, but I didn't. I was lost a lot of times. Totally lost. How I got out of most of my classes, I don't know. I must have been just naturally smart in some things because I just didn't know the system. I didn't know in  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A flunking a course to drop it. I didn't know if I got really behind to drop. I didn't know any of that. It seemed like there was no one there who knew to tell me that. My counselors were useless as far as I was concerned. They offered me nothing, nothing useful. DEAN: These were faculty advisors who were supposed to give you some clue . . . CRUMP: Right, yes. They gave me no clues. I got no help from them. They just sat there and listened to me and gave me nothing back. I didn't have anywhere to go. My parents didn't know anything about college, and so I flunked out, not knowing how not to flunk out. I had no idea. DEAN: What year was this? CRUMP: It was the end of the summer of my first year I flunked out, and I sat out for a semester. Then I came back and I was in for a year and a half, and I flunked out again. Then I came back and stayed until my fourth year and got hired because in the seventies, this was in seventy, they were hiring blacks. In this town, if you were black with clerical skills, you had it because they were putting all the blacks out front they could and all the blacks in offices they could. It was very hard to find any with clerical skills. We had not been to the vo-tech schools because there weren't any black secretaries. No one had the foresight to do this. I just imagined it. I didn't know that it was going to become possible. Southern's secretarial training was horrible. Horrible! I was so much more advanced than those students at Southern. I had done so much more than they had done. There's no way they could have beat me out for the job. DEAN: Tell me about some of the classes that you did take, both the ones you flunked and the ones you passed. CRUMP: I flunked math . . . that's, that's the one. I flunked it twice, and that was really my holdup. I needed a tutor, and I didn't know that, and no one knew because I did not understand the approach he was using in math. I thought I was just dumb in math. I wasn't. I wasn't. DEAN: What math class was this, Algebra? CRUMP: General math. I flunked general math. I was afraid of math in the first place because I never thought of myself as good at it because I made "C's" in it in high school, but I never flunked anything. This flunking business I didn't understand. DEAN: English? CRUMP: [53] English? I did well in it, for me. I got "C's" because we had to think. We had to write about what we read. Well, I had never done that. But I remember, this one professor told me, he said, he would be discussing the works that we had read. He would look at me and he said, "You look like you've got a thought on this." I would say, "No, I don't." I don't know if I did or not, but he would say this to me lots. He'd say, "You look  2  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A like you have a thought on this." He asked me to come to his office a couple of times, and I did, but I felt he was inappropriate with me. He sat too close to me. He asked me questions about fishing in my hometown, and if he came out to my hometown would my dad show him fishing areas, no, would I show him the fishing areas, and I said, "Well, my dad would show you." You know, and things like that, and so I felt he was inappropriate so I didn't like . . . DEAN: A little too personal? CRUMP: Yes, a little too personal. His knees touched mine a couple of times, too. DEAN: Oh. CRUMP: Yes, so. That was the only experience I had like that. I had heard of experiences like that, more than that. Actually if he had made more of an advance on me I would have had a hard time with it because I wouldn't have quite known what to do at that time, being my professor, you know. DEAN: This idea of sexual harassment was not something we knew about, right? CRUMP: No, no. It was that if he did it, it was your fault. You must have been sitting provocatively, had on too much makeup or something. He considered me as a thinker, but I wasn't. If I was, I wasn't aware of thinking. I was listening because I was fascinated at other people thinking and other people responding. I was lost, but I managed to get a "C". There were many classes that I was lost in that I got a "B" or a "C" in. How, I don't know. I had never felt that way before, lost. One of my favorite professors was Mark Carleton, a history professor. [71] DEAN: I know him well. CRUMP: Yes. He made history so interesting. I never knew history was so interesting. When Mark talked about it, and he was entertaining in the way he talked about it. You could tell he enjoyed it, and therefore I did. Even though it was a very large class, I wouldn't think of missing Mark's class. I think I got a "C" out of that, but for me, that was good! That was really good. I may have gotten a "B" out of that. I'm not sure. DEAN: Was this U.S. history or Louisiana history? CRUMP: U.S. DEAN: U.S. history. Did you take any other history classes? CRUMP: No. DEAN: Did you hear about T. Harry Williams?  3  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: Did you hear anything? What did you hear about him? I collect T. Harry stories. CRUMP: Now I can't remember, but I know that . . . I think he . . . was he . . . he was there then, because I remember some of the girls going to his house trick-or-treating. You know, they were saying, you know, "I trick-or-treated T. Harry Williams's." He was teaching there then? DEAN: Yes. CRUMP: Yes, because there were people who took his class. I didn't know to take his class. I didn't know about him, but they said it was wonderful. But since I . . . it just kind of went here for me, I didn't . . . this was about thinking, you see, and I didn't know about thinking. I didn't know about really, really getting into history. I didn't know about thinking about what Maxine wanted, you know, in a conscious process. I knew about it in spurts. I knew how to think in segments, but I didn't know how to flow into this will lead to this type thinking. I was just learning that. I was just watching people who could do that and I had no concept of what that was like. I really walked through in my sleep a lot there, not knowing I was, but I was absorbing nonetheless. I was absorbing. DEAN: Was Mark Carleton's class your best class? Or were there other classes that you did well and liked? CRUMP: Well, actually, Spanish was, I did the best in because I had been tutored. I understood how to study it and I understood how to listen in class for what I needed. That was fun. It may have helped me to understand some of my other classes better and what to listen for to be prepared for the test. Accounting is another one that destroyed me. That was when I flunked out the next time because I still had this fear of math. I had a very BORING instructor. He just didn't care. It was like he put the information out there. If you got it, you got it. If you didn't, you didn't. It fell out of his mouth and, I almost went to sleep in his class. He just didn't bother. He was extremely boring. I used to have nightmares about that class. I really did. Whenever I had a professor who took one moment to connect with me individually, I did well in that class. Swimming was one of those classes. [103] I got a "B" in swimming because I went in there frightened. I had taken first swimming class and had a very good instructor then, a woman, I don't remember her name, but she told me at the end of the class, she said, "You just started to really learn at the end of this class." She said, "I don't want you to stop now." She said, "I want to sign you up for the next class." So I went the next semester, and there was already a card in there for me for the thing, I said, "Oh, I guess I got to take this." So I went in there, they had boys and girls and it was like, "Oh, God!" So I went up to the coach, and I said, "Coach, I've finished beginning, but I didn't do very well in beginning class. These kids are already swimming, and I'm not going to be able to do this well starting out." He said, "I'm not going to judge you by the way they swim. I'll judge your progress." That was what he did, and I made a higher grade than  4  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A some of them who came in swimming. He had the right attitude for me. When he saw that I had some struggles at the very beginning, he put one of the lifeguards with me to work on my skills to get them up. Once I understood what the stroke was supposed to do, then I got it. I think I had been taught such backward ways, in a ways, such backward ways of learning. Sorry, but that was the way it was for my teachers. That I had had some screwed up styles taught to me, until I had to unlearn them at LSU and . . . I used to have to figure things out for myself, it seemed like, from the other teachers. So once I got it, I had it. Anything that, once you helped me understand what it is I'm doing here, then I could do it. In every situation where I had somebody work with me, then I got it. Not one math teacher, not one accounting teacher, not one physics teacher was that way. So those were the classes that killed me. Those were the only ones I couldn't pass. Because there was something in the concept that I never got. There was economics, everything that had numbers. Economics was a nightmare for me, too. I never understood the first thing. I didn't know what he was talking about. All of those professors seemed to not care, but it could have also been that I never connected with them, that I never went to them and said I didn't know or didn't understand. My understanding of it was so far away I didn't even know what to ask them. Only thing I could have gone to them and said, "I am totally lost. I haven't the faintest idea what you are talking about." But I decided that my education there may not have come at the academic level that I might have liked or my parents might have liked, but the education was no less invaluable. Invaluable to me. I admired those students, particularly those black students, who came in and just went right through with high grades and everything. [131] But they came out of good schools in Baton Rouge, for one thing, you know. I wasn't a dumb student, so I certainly can't say that it was because . . . you know that I'm excusing why they . . . but the schools in Baton Rouge were better. I mean, there were some really good schools because when we used to have to go to state competitions and things like that and compete with some of these Baton Rouge schools, we never beat them out. We had a couple of genius students at our school, and those are the only students that ever beat anybody out in competition at the other schools, but they were just geniuses. So I knew that there were some inadequacies in the schools that I went to. So many of these students, in fact, all of the black students who came the first year were, were the tops in their class, including me, but I was tops in the class of a school that was somewhat deprived. So I think I did well for what I came from, although I blamed myself at many points. I felt that maybe I wasn't working hard enough, didn't have good study habits, and that may have been true, too. I had some poor study habits at times. In a way, I thought that some of my poor study habits was because I didn't have a social life. I had so much time on my hands. I really had time to study. I just didn't feel like studying because something else was flat there. I started to miss a full social life. I was deprived of black students for the benefits I thought I got from associating with the white students to get the future that I thought I wanted. Because they it was limited where I went with them in terms of, I don't know, it just seemed to be some functions I was left  5  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A out of. Like I was never invited to a fraternity party, and that's what they had on weekends. You didn't have to be in a fraternity to go, but certainly no one was going to take me there because the sororities and fraternities were not going to accept me there at all. I would have been thrown out on my face, in the mud, probably. I mean, it was that serious. So, there were a lot of things like that I didn't get to go. When I went places with my friends, we went to a play at LSU, to a movie, to the game room, to bowling allies in town, to each other's dorms, or somebody's apartment. I could go to foreign students' parties. I became friends with a lot of foreign students, and I went to their parties in their apartments and stuff. I got to do that, but . . . DEAN: [158] Did you date at all? CRUMP: I had one date my first semester and one date my second. One date my first year and one date my second year. It wasn't until the summer of my third year that I started to date. DEAN: Who did you date those first two dates? CRUMP: There was, the first two, the first two dates were with the same guy, a friend of mine, my cousin's wife introduced me to him because he lived next door to her and he went to school at Southern. Bill Heidel. DEAN: So it was not an LSU student? CRUMP: No. He had his own car, a '65 Mustang, which was cool. That was the car to have. He was his mother's only son, and his mother was very, very snobbish about her son. DEAN: Did she approve of you? CRUMP: No. "I'm sorry, Bill's asleep." "That's okay, Mama I'll take it." Gee! DEAN: What didn't she approve of in you? CRUMP: I don't know, anybody with her son, probably. DEAN: I see. But later on, you did begin to date? CRUMP: Yes. DEAN: LSU students? Were they or no? CRUMP: No, he was from Southern, too. DEAN: He was from Southern.  6  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A CRUMP: I didn't date an LSU student . . . well, after that . . . after that guy, I dated an LSU student. Ralph Tyson, who is now a judge. We dated for the duration of the time I was there. DEAN: Were there campus-wide dances that you went to or anything like that? CRUMP: Yes, there were, sure did. People would ask me to dance, whites, foreign students. Jambalaya Jamboree. Especially in the late sixties, it was popular to dance with a black student then. It was just definitely popular because chances are she could dance. And I could. That got to be popular and so, yes, at big party functions and . . . just not fraternity and sorority, forget it. DEAN: They didn't start the black fraternities and sororities until after you had left, is that right? CRUMP: Right. It was in seventy-two, three, or four, somewhere in there. But I wouldn't have joined anyway. I had a friend, Sing Lee, Chinese, who was raised by southern whites, and he had a southern accent. I used to say, "Sing, I just can't get over your accent!" He could not understand what was funny about his accent. I said, "Surely, Sing, you have got to realize how funny it is for me to look at your Chinese face and hear this southern accent coming out of it!" He, he didn't think it was so funny! [194] And then I had a friend who, who tried to . . . my friend from New Orleans, Janel, told me of a guy who had been black-balled from a fraternity. I said, "What's that?" She said, "You don't know what a black-ball is?" I said, "No." And I thought, "Oh, oh, I guess I'm getting ready to feel stupid here, something I'm supposed to know that I don't know." I said, "No, I don't." Se said, "They've kicked him out of the fraternity." I says, "Why?" She said, "Pshhh"--That was Janel, she was always, "Come on." I said, "I don't know, Janel." She says, "Maxine, isn't it obvious?" I said, "No, it isn't, Janel." She says, "It's because he associates with me, and I'm your friend." I was stopped in my track. It was like you know this music they use on tv when the point is made, it's like, you know, this boom. Loud music in my head, it was like, "What?" My world blanked out for a minute, there I just . . . my stomach turned, that was just . . . the most devastating experience for me. I was angry. I was everything. What were these people doing? Who were they to do that? I became angry, I mean, I wanted to do something. I really wanted to do something then. You know, and Janel, "Oh come on. Don't worry about it. ?ho needs those people?" It was like, "This is bigger than that, Janel. This is bigger than that." "Pshhh, why worry about it?" She could say that. Then I met Chris. What was Chris' last name? Marcuson, Chris Marcuson, from Slidell, who was also considered a misfit by the university. She only dated Latin guys. She used to ask me why was I so angry because by then I was angry about all of that, and I kept it inside because none of my white friends would let me talk about it. They were all, "Eh." You know they want just enjoy being with us, do what we do. We'll take care of you type thing. Don't worry about all of that stuff. So no one would let me talk about being black, and that just got to be something inside of me that was building up. I was very angry by then. I had flunked out twice. My self-esteem had been lowered or at least threatened by  7  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A then, and there were a lot of things that happened to me that I had no outlet for, no explanation for. Nothing had happened to me directly. It's like being anemic, you're not sick enough to be in bed, and no one can see you're sick walking around, and yet you're sick, very very sick. That's the way I was, I was walking around anemic. I was in trouble. I was hurting. I had no one. No one understood. No one knew. I had no real peer group. I didn't really belong anywhere. I had priced myself out of the market in every way. And . . . DEAN:[230] You didn't have a group of black friends to share this with? CRUMP: Oh, no, they were, you know, they, what could I share with them? I would have had to limit what I tell them because, you know, I still had white friends, and they didn't think much of that. Yolanda was okay with it, but it was still, I would, I could tell her some, but I really had no one that I could share the full experience with. Priests, nuns. I never went to Michael Cody. I probably could have shared the full experience with him. But for some reason, he seemed to be dealing with bigger things than what I could go to him with. So that just didn't seem to fit. The nuns, I thought, "What do they know?" "What do they know? Their clothes cover their whole lives." So I just didn't have anyone. I kept it inside and I lashed out in ways that would make . . . white girls had this way of being able to giggle about anything. They learned a one emotion to everything, up, upbeat and above everything, nothing touched them until they cried about something that seemed irrelevant to me. When they said they were angry, it didn't look like anger to me. They would go "Eh, this makes me so mad." I'm thinking, "You're angry? You should see me when I'm angry." I never saw real expression. They didn't seem to have real deep feelings, and I started to get a little tired of this superficial way of relating. So I had a lot of problems within myself that didn't show on the outside to anyone that I could understand except the girls who would go, "Ahh, Maxine, why does that make you angry? Come on!" So it was like, "You don't understand." That part of the experience was tough. So, I started to become unhappy and just wish that college would just be over. When I had an opportunity to get out, I was ready to go. I couldn't have taken another semester. DEAN:[258] So you didn't graduate? CRUMP: No. DEAN: Didn't go back ever and finish it? CRUMP: No. For a long time, I couldn't go back. It was too sore. I was too sore inside. I needed to heal. Then it was like, "Go back for what? I'm in a whole new career now." By then I was in radio. I knew secretarial wasn't what I wanted, but I didn't know anything else there that I wanted. It never came a time when I could look back at LSU and say, "What curriculum do I really want?" It was like, "None!" So, when I got in broadcasting. Probably if had it been available then, I still wouldn't have taken it because I didn't think it was easy. The kids at school used to say, "You should take journalism. It's easy." I used to think, "Writing. I can't write. I can't think, let alone write. You've got to think to write."  8  Crump, Maxine - Tape 205, Side A I was glad to get out into the boring plants. Then, I couldn't take that because I realized this is not for me. The first three years in that company, I was happy because it was a brand new company going on line so I got the . . . DEAN: What company was this? CRUMP:[272] Ciba-Geigy. A European based company. They had a lot of exciting things to it, and I got to use my skills there because it was brand new. I walked into an office with a desk and file cabinets and not the first paper. I had to put everything together. That was fun. Not very many college students get that opportunity. You go in there, and you take what they already have set up. I had a young boss, who was thirtyfour years old, and he was open to me bringing in my new ideas and doing them. So I had quite a privilege there. But after three years, that was not my career. Everywhere I went, having been to LSU meant something, and that was good. It was worth having gone. It has never not been worth it for me. I wouldn't have made another decision. I never regretted going to LSU. In fact, I always have been very happy about having gone there. It had a lot of happy moments for me and a lot of very tough moments. But I attribute it to a lot of my ability to think and move through society as it is, on its terms. DEAN: Well, that sounds to me like a closure point. CRUMP: [291] Okay. [End Tape 205, Side A.

Recreation and Park Commission.; Civil rights movements--Louisiana--Baton Rouge.; Louisiana--Race relations.; Public welfare--Louisiana--Baton Rouge.	In February 1964, the Supreme Court overturned a Louisiana law requiring segregation of public park facilities. In May of that year, U.S. District Judge E. Gordon West ordered the integration of the Recreation and Parks Commission facilities, which included the public pools. The commission decided to fill in the pool at City Park instead.  In 1966, the other public pools in the city were still closed, as Burns writes.    <br><br>  The Baton Rouge Council on Human Relations was established in 1965 to foster community awareness of racial discriminatory practices and policies. To ensure compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Council monitored local restaurants, public parks, doctors’ offices, and other community facilities, such as public parks.		en		Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections	Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Manuscript Collection	Baton Rouge Council on Human Relations Records, Mss. 4813	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Text	JPEG2000							Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

Marsh Transcription										LSU Libraries Special Collections  Note from the curator: Transcription reflects spelling as it appears in the original.  Edward N. Marsh Civil War Letter Baton Rouge December 18th 1862  Dear Brother and Sister it is with great pleasure I now seat myself to write you a few lines to let you know that I am pretty well and hope that these few lines will find you the same. We left New Orleans the 16th for this place and sailed up the river with our little expedition. I don't know how many thousand there is here. They have not all go here yet. The Iron Clad Esex [Essex] came up ahead and 4 or 5 other gun Boats followed her. We got here at 9 o'clock in the morn and they fired 13 shots into the City and they sent a flag down to the Boat and left as soon as possible and then we sent a boat with some men to the Capital of the place and put up the flag of our union and then the troops began to land and the Confederates left the place. As soon as possible we came up into the City and pitched our tent and we went into the houses and brought out chairs and books and every thing that we could get that we could use. I got this paper out of an account book. There was a report today our men had drove the Rebels out of Vicksburg and that they were coming down this way. There was twenty thousand of them above here about 14 miles1. We have to sleep with cartridges [cartridge] boxes and belts on and lay on our guns and have them loaded with 4 rounds and cartridges in our boxes and we keep out pickets now.... The inhabitants have most all left the place when we fired into the City. They killed two Boys. They were helping the Rebels to get their cannons away from here.... There was 50 Negroes ran from their master and came here for protection today. 19th There was 32 more come today with their Budgets(?) with them. They say that they have not had any shoes for one year and they are barefooted almost. Their clothes are awful ragged. The inhabitants are starving. They cannot get salt hardly. It is 75 cents a lb and a girl told me yesterday that her Master was dead and she hired her time of her Mistress. She pays her three dollars a week for time. She said she had to work tremendous hard to live. Flour is forty dollars a barrel in United States money and 80 dollars in Confederate money....We expect an attack any time. (I think) we shall have a hard fight here or at that fort above here about 15 miles before long. This city looks hard. There is a great many houses Burnt to the ground. Our officers have a nice house to stay in. It is lighted up with gas and a pretty one. I most close now so good bye from Edward N. Marsh 1  He is referring to Port Hudson.  1	Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections			Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )									Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

"A 15th Representation of Krewe of Proteus, Subject: Dumb Society," Carnival Edition of the Picayune.  New Orleans, February 17, 1896.	Since 1986 the LSU Libraries' Special Collections division has been actively involved with the United States Newspaper Program, which seeks to preserve and make accessible newspapers printed in the fifty states and in the trust territories.  <br><br>Two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities have made it possible for Louisiana Newspaper Project staff working for the LSU Libraries to cataloged all extant Louisiana newspapers they could locate in the state.  That cataloging information is available via the Internet using the OCLC Union List system. In addition, records for Louisiana newspapers held by the LSU Libraries can be found in the Libraries' online catalog.<br><br>Since the 1950s, LSU Libraries staff have been microfilming Louisiana newspapers of record in order to preserve their historical content for future generations.  We continue to do this today, filming between 90 and 100 titles (approximately 70,000+ pages) each year, providing the film to our patrons, to parish libraries, and via interlibrary loan to people throughout the country. We also preserve historic newspapers pre-dating 1870, as well as special editions such as this lively Mardi Gras poster issued by the Times-Picayune.

Lloyd's Steamboat Directory and Disasters on the Western Waters	Lloyd, James T.	1856		Philadelphia; Cincinnati, J.T. Lloyd		Steamboat disasters.; Steam-navigation--Mississippi River Valley.; Railroads--United States--History.; Mississippi River Valley--Description and travel.; Mississippi River--Description and travel.; Ohio River--Description and travel.	In 1856 Lloyd's Steamboat Directory and Disasters on the Western Waters details more than a hundred steamboat disasters, including explosions, collisions, sinkings, and capsizes.  The illustration showing the explosion of the steamship Louisiana docked in New Orleans is shown.	Early European explorers faced many challenges, including unfamiliar and sometimes dangerous flora and fauna, as well as the hostility of the human inhabitants whose homelands they sought to take for themselves.  Under French government policy, the native population was soon decimated by systematic extermination and disease.  Later settlers found diseases such as yellow fever and typhoid a threat during the summer months. Along with the multitude of natural hazards that new populations faced, sometimes transportation was a source of danger in itself.	en		Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections	Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Book Collection		Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	iv, 223 p. illus.

France et Espagne	Canonge, Louis Placide	1850		Nouvelle-Orleans, 1850.			France et Espagne (1850) is about the Revolution of 1768, but in it Canonge was less concerned with following history than he was with creating a dramatic effect.  He introduced romantic characters to heighten the drama. The play was based on the novel Louisiana, written by Garreau and published in La Revue Louisianaise in 1845.	Born in Louisiana to French parents, Louis Placide Canonge (1822-1893) exemplifies the continuing tradition of Louisiana literature written in French. As a young man, Canonge frequently visited Paris, where he developed a deep love for the arts and literature, as well as a taste for being culturally au courant. According to the Cambridge History of English and American Literature, he was the best dramatist produced by Louisiana.... He was a director of opera and a journalist of some note; he edited La Lorgnette, L'Entracte, Courrier, L'Impartial, Le Courrier Français, Le Sud, La Renaissance, L'Epoque, and L'Abeille, the last-named, founded in 1827, being the first French daily newspaper published in the United States. His plays followed the French romantic tradition, and were extremely popular because of their gaiety and enthusiasm.	fr		Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections	Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Book Collection	PQ2203 .C47 F7 CAGE	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	66 p. 23 cm.

Western meadowlark drawing, printed proof, and image from book	Audubon, John James	c. 1835	1830; 1831; 1832; 1833; 1834; 1835; 1836; 1837; 1838; 1839; 1840			Birds--North America.	Audubon observed new birds on his travels in the western U.S. during the 1830s and added them to the petite édition.  The Western Meadowlark is one of the additions.  Shown here is Audubon’s original pencil drawing, an uncolored proof of the lithograph, and the finished, colored lithograph as it was published in the first edition.	John James Audubon’s engraved, hand-colored elephant folio edition of the Birds, published 1827-1838, was a critical success, but proceeds from its sale were exhausted by the time it was finished.  Audubon, always a financial ne’er-do-well, was determined to capitalize on his rising reputation in order to support his family.  Returning to the United States, he began publication of a seven-volume royal octavo edition of the Birds that he dubbed his petite édition.  Sold by subscription, it cost $100 in contrast to the folio engraved edition, which had cost $1,000.    <br><br>  For the petite édition Audubon used lithography – literally “writing on stone” – instead of engraving.  Developed at the end of the 18th century by Alois Senefelder, lithography had come into its own in the 19th century.  As art historian Ron Tyler explains  <br><br>  Lithography is often explained in simple terms, but it is a deceptively complex process….  It requires a soft, porous stone, the best of which is still quarried near Solenhofen, Bavaria.  The stones are cut into various sizes and thicknesses, depending upon the size of the press and the image to be reproduced, and then ground … until the desired texture, or grain, is obtained.  The lithographic artist, who does not need the special skills of the engraver, then draws on the stone with special greasy or waxy crayons.  When the drawing is complete, the stone is bathed with gum Arabic and nitric acid to “fix” the drawing.  A greasy, sticky ink is then applied to the stone with a roller. It adheres to the drawing but is repelled by the wet stone.  The printer then lays a piece of paper on the stone, applies pressure, and “pulls” the print from the stone. (p. 53)  <br><br>  As Tyler further notes, “In preparing the reductions of Audubon’s images, [the lithographer] faced a daunting task: to copy, in a greatly reduced format, one of the most beautiful books ever produced.”  <br><br>  In some cases, Audubon’s son John Woodhouse Audubon and other artists used a camera lucida (which used a lens and a prism to project a reduced image onto paper) to produce outline drawings of an appropriate size to be transferred to litho stones.  In other cases, Audubon himself created the drawings.  LSU holds a small archive of drawings of both types, including 13 drawings attributed to Audubon.  <br><br>  To complete the transfer to the litho stone, the drawings would be covered with a sheet of tracing paper held in place with wax, then traced over in red or brown crayon.  In some instances, the crayon was applied directly to the drawing.  Examples of both are displayed.  On Audubon’s drawing for the downy woodpecker, small pieces of tracing paper still adhere to the red wax.    <br><br>  Crayon was applied directly to the drawing for the hemlock warbler, which was done using a grid and camera lucida.

Magruder Diary Transcription										LSU Libraries Special Collections  Eliza Magruder Diary [January] 19th, [1846] Rained incessantly all day, the wind blowing pretty fresh most of the time from N.E. which prevented Uncle Dunbar from going to the Plains to survey. I read a half hour this evening, with that exception, I knit all day. 20th Rained early this morning, about eight o clock the wind got round to S.W. and there was every appearance of its clearing up, but in a few hours it clouded up again it has been misting all the afternoon. Uncle Dunbar has been writing in the Office nearly all day, Mr. Archer dined here, he has just recovered from an attack of ague and fever, Mr. Johnston rode up to the gate this afternoon and told Uncle Dunbar of his carriage horses having been stolen out of the stable last Sunday night, and of his haveing found them in Natchez, the next day. Aunt Olivia had Alfred and Jim setting out evergreens in the yard this morning. I wrote two letters this morning one to Lucy the other to Lloyd, and this evening knit a pair of dolls socks. Cousin Susan is still with us and recruiting(?). 21st Cloud this morning, cleared about noon. Uncle Dunbar went to the Plains to survey, did not return tonight. Aunt Olivia has been out a good deal to day seeing to the setting out of evergreens in the yard, had the rose hedge at the end of the store room cut up. She read four homilies to Cousin Susan and I to night. I mended a coat for Uncle Dunbar to day and commenced a coarse mit to night for one of the negro men. 22nd A little cloudy and very cold.

Duplantier Letters Transcripts										LSU Libraries Special Collections  Armand Duplantier Letters January 10, 1796 [Duplicate] Finally, my good friend, they have just published La Paix for us here on the first day of the year, which we were awaiting with much impatience. I hope, dear brother, that now I will receive your dear news a little more often. For more than three years, I have not received a single word from any of my relatives. I do not know what has become of you during all that trouble. I am undergoing the greatest impatience to receive some word and fear at the same time learning anything that will perhaps be too troublesome for me. Write me, then, by all routes. That of Spain will be, I think, the most prompt. I sent you this by the American route. I hope also that French ships will come to us and that they will bring me your news. I have written to you and to my father every year by the American route, asking you to give me your news by that route, but I have not received any. I hope that you have received some of mine. I was giving you all the details on what I had done with my uncle's succession. I believe that this year the greatest portion of the funds will be returned, that I will have ready first orders that I will receive from my relatives. The plantation is not sold. The times have been so critical and so unfavorable that I have not aimed to sell it. I have successfully made the sale of slaves. Otherwise, there would have surely been a great deal of compromise due to an insurrection of Negroes that almost occurred last spring in this colony and that had to start at Pointe Coupe. Happily, the thing was discovered in time. They sentenced fifty of them and some leaders, who were all Creoles or Negroes of talent, which stopped their scheme. Despite that, we were not at ease until the moment when they informed us through La Paix. The example of St. Domingue still troubles us. I have much regret over having bought a number of them. If they regain a little value, I would not delay in ridding myself of them. I wait for your news to know the part I must take. Indigo, despite La Paix, is not worth much here. They tell us that it is the same in Europe. Mark exactly from me what it is. My intention being to send some, inform yourself of the prices of different qualities at Bordeaux and Le Havre de Grace if one can hope that it will be worth something. Having no or very little resource here for the education of my children, I was 1  LSU Libraries Special Collections  determined to send my two oldest ones to North America, where there are good colleges, but today, being able to send them to France, I am just waiting to receive your news. I have the greatest regret over seeing these dear children losing their time. They are vigorous and well constituted. They learn with ease everything that people want to teach them. My dear wife is now in a little better health than she has been for the last few years. Despite that, we have not had a child in four years. I still have my three sons, who are well. The last one caused us much anxiety in the first two years of his life when he fell ill to cruel diseases. Presently, he is well! How happy I would be, my dear friend, to learn that you all also are enjoying good health. How much satisfaction I would have in learning that you have passed this storm without accident! Embrace my father and my mother most tenderly for us. Tell them the most respectful and tender things, to think sometimes of their children here, who love them with all their hearts, to maintain their affection. We never cease praying for their preservation. We speak of them continually, and of all of you others. You are the subject of our most tender and pleasant conversations. My wife and I embrace you and our dear sister with our whole heart. Your little nephews do as much and ask for your affection. Remember me to all our relatives and friends. Tell them the most honorable and amicable things for me. I would like sometimes to imagine that maybe I will see you here, but I see that that is impossible. The great age of my father and my mother does not permit that you leave them for an instant. I rejoice sometimes that the will of my uncle that you must have found (as I mentioned it to you all) in the clerk's office of the late public notary is in favor of my mother and that you could well come yourself to look for her benefit. How much pleasure I would have, my good friend, to see you here! I think that you would bring your sister and your little nephews, and I would not delay in following you after having collected my little fortune, whatever it would be. Do not neglect to send some procurations or someone as soon as possible. Goodbye, my good friend. Love a brother who will love you all the days of his life, and believe me your sincere friend. Duplantier When you write me by the way of Spain, do not speak to me of politics or the revolution if you want your letters to arrive.  2  LSU Libraries Special Collections  As surely some French ships will come to us, address your letters to Messieurs Merci at Bordeaux and put them under the envelope of Mr. Sarpy, merchant, New Orleans, who is in correspondence with that house, an old friend of my uncle and mine. My mother must have received a letter from my wife that she wrote her a little while after my uncle's death, having found one from her to my wife in the papers that he had guarded for her. If the French ships come to us, send me some garden seeds, above all some white beets and beets of all types, cabbage, carrots, yellow turnips, and others in quantity, plain celery, lettuce, and some flower bulbs and seeds.

Letter, Armand Duplantier to his brother, January 10, 1796	Duplantier, Armand	1796				Emigration and immigration--Louisiana.; Plantation life--Louisiana--Pointe Coupee Parish.; Louisiana--History--1803-1865.; New Orleans (La.)--History--19th century.	Armand Duplantier was born in Voiron, France, in 1753.  He served as General Lafayette's aide-de-camp during the Revolutionary War and in 1782 came to Louisiana to assist his maternal uncle, Claude Trenonay, with his plantation in Pointe Coupee.  Through his marriage to Constance Rochon, he acquired Magnolia Mound Plantation, located on Nicholson Drive.  In this letter to his brother living in France during the French Revolution, Duplantier relates settling the estate of his uncle, the discovery of a planned slave insurrection in Pointe Coupeé Parish and the unease it has caused because of the fresh memory of the slave revolt in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), and his desire to send his children to America or France for an education because of the lack of opportunity in Louisiana  His letter also illustrates the difficulty Louisiana colonists had in maintaining communications with their families in France.

Perrault Transcription										Note from the curator: Transcription reflects spelling as it appears in the original. Guillaume-Michel Perrault Letter New Orleans, this 30th of April, 1788 Mrs. Widow Perrault, at Qubec in Canada Madam and Dear Sister: I inform you with pleasure of the receipt of your two kind letters of July 3 and November 8 last. They have given me still more pleasure as they confirm to me the continuation of your good health and that of the whole family, which I love as I love you and whom I embrace from the bottom of my heart. Dear sister, while you notify me in your last letter of the receipt of my letter of March 1, to which I am still referring, I cannot but be very moved by the proof you give me of looking forward to the moment of my arrival in your midst. Dear sister, you should not doubt the reciprocity of the good wishes that I have constantly formed to be able to join you, but a number of obstacles seem to arrive to make this impossible until this moment. Dear sister, we have just suffered most cruelly from all that might have happened through the general fire (excepting only a few houses) of our city, which was reduced to ashes in less than two hours by flames carried by the wind to the four corners of this unfortunate city. In this deadly desolation, I had only the time to save myself from my house and to have poor Mrs. [Demieux ?] taken from her bed there (stricken as she was for the past six months with a gangrenous and deadly dysentery), which despicable acts and my embarrassment at being obliged to put this dear niece in the middle of a field during a most ghastly night without covering or mattress for her or shelter determined my taking her to the German Parish, to one of the settlers who is a friend, and it is there that in spite of all possible care, God put an end to the great pain and suffering of this dear niece for whom I cannot but feel the deepest sorrow. After my last attentions to her, I returned to this deserted city to come to the aid of poor Laveau, the most friendly but also the most unfortunate man in this general disaster, from which he has not succeeded in saving even a garment. You can judge how badly I felt when I saw him, his wife, and three children all by themselves, forced to stay in a thatch roof while waiting for a small house (which I am having built for them and which I will let them use freely) to be finished so that they may  lodge there. In this general misfortune, dear sister, I have lost 10,000 piastres1 consisting of three houses and a small shop where there were lots of goods, nice furniture, and all kinds of useful articles, as well as about three thousand piastres in paper money that I absentmindedly had put in a corner of my armoire, believing that I had placed them safely in a small money box where I kept my other important papers and that I only hurriedly had been able to take with me. This loss of ten thousand piastres I just suffered was, dear sister, all the profits (after expenses) that my toil and work had acquired for me since my arrival in this colony, together with the small capital you know about, which I had brought with me and which remains mine, as I almost always had them invested in annuities well secured by good land and notes endorsed by credible people. This is my position concerning what I have left. Moreover, I remain the guardian and caretaker of the two children of the poor deceased, the ones remaining of the five she had at the time of her troubles with her husband, who is a bandit and whom I had thrown out of my place six years ago, all this taken together with having to observe the sad situation of Laveau and his family, left with no other resources but his income from his work, which will never again cover his losses.... Your affectionate brother and servant, M. Perrault 1- dollars.

Special Delivery Cameras										Special Collections Cameras Detailed information about each camera in the photo from left to right. (far left) Camera: Rainbow Hawkeye Vest Pocket Type: Folding bellows camera Model: None Date: 1930s Manufacturer: Eastman Kodak Format/Film: 127 rollfilm Lens: 4 stops via rotating slide f11 Shutter: T/I Notes: This line came in various colors, including rose and green. Camera: Stereo Graphic Type: 35mm viewfinder stereo camera Model: NA Date: Introduced in 1956 Manufacturer: Graflex Inc., Rochester, New York Format/Film 35mm Lens: Graflex Graflar f4/35mm Shutter: Guillotine Type: shutter between lenses. Speeds of B and 1/50 Notes: As early as 1841, photographers experimented with stereographs, using cameras with two lenses to record images at slightly different angles. When seen in a stereo viewer, the two images are seen as a three-dimensional picture. Interest in stereographic photography has waxed and waned, with periods of popularity in the 1850/60s, the early 1900s, and late 1940s/early 50s. Representing this latest period was the Stereo Graphic, a fixed-focus camera using lenses focused to different distances.  Camera: Mycro Type: Miniature Model: I Date: 1938-40 Manufacturer: Sanwa Co. Ltd., Japan Format/Film: 16mm Lens: Mycro UNA f4.5/20mm Shutter: Behind-the-lens shutter. Speeds of B, 1/24, 1/50, and 1/100sec Notes: This camera is an early example of miniature 16mm format cameras that became popular from the late 1940s through the 60s. The Mycro was produced from 1938 through the 1950s.  1  (far right) Camera: No. 1 Brownie Type: Box Model: NA Date: Introduced in 1901 Manufacturer: Eastman Kodak, Rochester, New York Format/Film: 117 rollfilm Lens: Meniscus Shutter: Eastman rotary. Speeds of T and I Notes: One of several models produced through 1916 based on the original Kodak Brownie box camera first manufactured in 1900. These cameras had a wood reinforced cardboard body and slip-in film back. 117 rollfilm produced six 2 1/4 by 1  in. exposures. The name "Brownie" may have come from popular illustrated poems and stories by Palmer Cox using figures called "brownies."  2														Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections, LOUISiana Digital Library, Baton Rouge, La.

Transcript Hamilton 453A										Narrator: Leo Hamilton 4700.0322 Interviewer: Mary Hebert Session I Transcriber: Robin Cate 21 August 1993 [Begin Tape 453, Side A. Begin Session I.] MARY HEBERT: [001] This is Mary Hebert. Today is August twenty-first, 1993, and I am going to be talking to Leo Hamilton. And we're at Hill Memorial Library on LSU's campus. Okay, first we're going to start out just me asking you just a few questions about your background, and then we'll stop the machine and make sure that the sound quality is okay. LEO HAMILTON: Okay. HEBERT: Okay, first, I'd like for you to just tell me your first name. HAMILTON: Leo. HEBERT: Your full name. Your full name. HAMILTON: My full name, Leo Charles Hamilton. HEBERT: And when and where were you born? HAMILTON: June twenty-third, 1951, in Baton Rouge. HEBERT: And what was your father's name? HAMILTON: Leo Hamilton. HEBERT: So you're Leo Hamilton, Junior? HAMILTON: No. I'm Leo Charles. My, I'm the second of six kids, and my mother thought if there was to be a junior it should be the first. And she has eight sisters and one brother, and her brother's name is Charles. So, I'm Leo Charles. HEBERT: So you're Leo Charles. HAMILTON: Right. HEBERT: And what about, what was your mother's first and maiden name? HAMILTON: Myrtle Franklin. [break in tape]  1  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A HEBERT: What did your father do for a living? HAMILTON: He was a machinist. Well, he, yes, he's retired now. He was a machinist with Holsum Bakery here in Baton Rouge. HEBERT: Did your mother work? HAMILTON: Off and on. She worked as a domestic, really, for most of my life, and then she did . . . Well, all her life she wanted to be a nurse and did not get the opportunity to go to school to do so. And actually, I guess it must have been in about 1971 she decided to go to one of these schools, small business colleges around town, and now, she's a nurses' aide. She just decided it was time to do something about it, and so she's a nurses' aide. She does home health care. HEBERT: Did she not have the opportunity to go to college or to go to a nursing school? Was that . . . HAMILTON: Well, no. What happened was she got married, I guess, gosh, right after my dad got out of the service and had children and at the time could not afford it. There really weren't a whole bunch of opportunities available, and, as I mentioned earlier, there are six of us. So, with six kids, she just didn't have the time. HEBERT: That's true. HAMILTON: And at about '71, and I say '71 or '72, I can't remember exactly, but the three boys are a year apart. All of us attended LSU and my brother Gregory was in his second year here in '71 and that was the time at which she decided, my sisters are younger than us, and she just felt she had the time so she went to school part time, got her . . . I remember helping her, that's how I can remember we were in school, and I remember helping her study. So at that time, she got her degree, and now, she's a nurses' aide. HEBERT: What was their level of education, your parents? HAMILTON: High school. HEBERT: High school. HAMILTON: They both finished high school. HEBERT: Here in Baton Rouge. They're both from Baton Rouge? HAMILTON: Actually, they're from Pointe Coupee Parish. My dad's from Morganza and my mom's from Bachelor. And they did finish school here in Baton Rouge at McKinley High School. But you have to remember when they were in school there,  2  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A McKinley High School was the only black high school for the three or four-parish area. So they rode a bus from Bachelor and Morganza to school at McKinley. HEBERT: So they met at McKinley High? HAMILTON: Yes. HEBERT: You said you had six brothers and sisters. Well, there are six of you. HAMILTON: Right. HEBERT: Could you give me your brother and sister's names and the order of their birth? HAMILTON: Larry is the oldest. Gregory is the . . . well, I'm the second. Gregory is third and he's a year younger. Oh gosh, Glenda. Glenda is the oldest girl. And, I guess Glenda is three years younger than Gregory. And Sheila, Sheila Gayle, is two years younger than Glenda. And Sandra is three years younger than Sheila. I have to put it that way. HEBERT: And what was their level of education? You said your brothers all came to LSU, did your sisters? HAMILTON: Yes, my brother Larry started LSU, quit, after his freshman year, I guess really after the first semester of his sophomore year. Went to the Marine Corps, was in the Marine Corps for nine and a half years. Came back from the Marine Corps and graduated from Southern. My brother Gregory graduated from LSU, as I did. Glenda came to LSU, left, I guess Glenda left here after her . . . I think Glenda left after her first semester of her sophomore year and went to work, got married, and completed school, eventually, in Atlanta at Clark, a small college, in Atlanta. Sheila left LSU after her junior year and she eventually completed school in Washington. I've forgotten the name of the school, small college in Washington, D.C. And my sister Sandra left after her sophomore year, mid-semester second semester, got married and just left, and she's working now, here in Baton Rouge. HEBERT: Did your parents encourage you to come to college? Was . . . HAMILTON: Oh, yes. HEBERT: Was that expected? HAMILTON: Well, it was desired. My parents, my mother, I guess more than anyone else, always wanted us to go to college and wanted us to go to LSU. I mean you have to remember, I grew up in south Baton Rouge. I was born in south Baton Rouge about six blocks from the campus. So we grew up listening to the LSU football games on my front door step and coming to and from the campus. In between, I guess, my mom's different 3  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A jobs, one of the jobs she had was working here on the campus for a while. And, because, I said, she was a domestic, but she did some other things as well. But, she worked on the campus, and I guess there was always this thing that that school's right there. She always wanted us to go to college, and it was right there. It was always like "If you can go to LSU, why don't you go to LSU?" So we always had this thing about LSU, it was kind of like it was right there, it was a neighborhood school. So it was, and, and my dad was a big civil rights person, I mean really into this integration thing, really into getting his kids involved in it, and it was, it was a, it was a goal that his kids were not going have to go across town . . . HEBERT: To Southern? HAMILTON: Not that we have anything against Southern, but it's the idea that you had to go. And that that school is right there and they're going to go to school right there. And we were fortunate enough to be able to do that. HEBERT: Did your father take part in any of the civil rights activities in Baton Rouge, such as the bus boycott? HAMILTON: Oh yes. Dad did all, he did all that stuff. My dad did all that kind of things. He was a, a, he's kind of hot- headed and he got involved in a lot of that. Not as a leader as much as one of these people who did a lot of leg work. He marched and did that kind of stuff, but, as much as he could and keep jobs. You know, you hack people off you lose your job. So as much as he could and keep his job. And he was more involved in voting rights than anything else. HEBERT: Registering people to vote. That kind of thing. HAMILTON: Right. He really was much more concerned about that. That was a big thing with him and my mom. HEBERT: Was he, were they involved in any of the national organizations such as . . . HAMILTON: NAACP. But that's, you know, I mean, I don't think anybody of their age group who did anything wasn't involved in the NAACP. So, in that sense, yes. HEBERT: So you grew up in a home that it was expected . . . that civil rights was a part of it. HAMILTON: Well, that you get an education, that you understand what the civil rights movement was about, and that you did better than the people who came before you and that you moved outside of a segregated environment. HEBERT: Did your parents ever lose jobs because of their involvement in the movement? 4  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A HAMILTON: My dad lost two. I mean, I know he lost a job at Sunbeam Bakery and one other. But like I said, my dad's got kind of a hot temper and he has a habit of stating his opinion about a lot of things. Not that I always agree with my dad, but I mean he . . . and we have arguments about a lot, so I know he lost some jobs on that but that's part of what you're doing. So they had, they were involved in it and had some struggles but they did okay. HEBERT: [115] Did you-all ever have any contact with people such as Reverend Jemison or Johnnie Jones? HAMILTON: Oh Johnnie Jones and Joe Dubb [?] and all those people because we're all in the neighborhood here in Baton Rouge and Rev. Jemison, too. But my parents, my dad probably, my dad's Baptist, and my mom's Methodist, so that has something to do with whether or not they would move in those circles with Rev. Jemison. My mom would tell you more about Reverend Haynes, who was a Methodist minister. HEBERT: Is that J. K. Haynes? No. HAMILTON: L. L. Haynes . . . HEBERT: L. L. Haynes. Okay. HAMILTON: . . . was the, was involved in those days. J. K. Haynes is education at Southern and L.E.A. and all that sort of thing. But they were religious, much more so than, and much more involved in that than any other groups. Because those groups, because those groups are more geared towards teachers and, and academicians or people who were more involved in the educational system. HEBERT: So your parents were more involved in, in, well, the religious . . . well, the not, not too much education. HAMILTON: Yes, through the church. Yes, through the church because grass roots were through the church, and they were really more grass roots than the leadership level. HEBERT: [130] Let's get back to talking about your childhood. What kind of chores were you expected to do as a child around the house? HAMILTON: Oh wow! Gee, around the house, I mean you did all the chores everybody else does around the house. You did the housework. Because our parents were working all the time. HEBERT: So the children were responsible for keeping up the house and the yard. HAMILTON: Oh, and the older kids kept the younger kids, and you kept the house up. During summers when we weren't in school and weren't able to or weren't required to do 5  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A those sort of things, my dad did other jobs, odd job type things, because he's kind of . . . My parents were from the farm, so they had sort of like other, I mentioned they do one thing but they did other things as part-time work, too, because you got six kids, you got to do a bunch of things. So, my dad used to work with construction jobs, too, like on the weekends, and I've done everything from cleaning bricks to mixing cement, carpenter's helper, you know, all kinds of manual type stuff, labor like that. My brothers and I, we, if Daddy was working on a on a project with some folks and they needed some helpers, we went out and did what was required. We carried wheelbarrows and helped people with bricks and wood and whatever the devil else they need you to do. HEBERT: Did you ever have a job on your own, like not through your father? HAMILTON: Oh yes. I guess my first job was when I was in high school, a sophomore in high school. And my brother, Larry, had the job first, then he got me the job, then Gregory got the job. But we were delivering groceries on a bike. City Grocery, on the corner of North Boulevard and 12th Street here in Baton Rouge, was one. And, oh God, let's see, I've done hamburger work, you know working . . . not, but it's not here anymore, Burger Cream Town, used to be a hamburger place in South Baton Rouge. It's been closed for years. I worked over there . . . Everything else, I would guess, would be after college. Because after I got into college, worked on the campus through student aid, and I worked in, in the library over there, in Middleton Library. Actually, my first job as a student was with the Louisiana Higher Education Facilities Commission. The commission was doing a facilities study, campus facilities studies, throughout the state of all the campuses. And what we did was measure space in all the buildings on the campus for utilization, buildings and structures, because, I mean, we even did the darn farms. But, we were doing a spatialization study. Then after that, I worked at the library, and then I had some off-campus jobs. Around-the-Corner restaurant was one. HEBERT: That just closed recently didn't it? HAMILTON: Yes, it did, just closed . . . It's the pizza place now, Pizza Hut. And I think it was something else even before that. Then, I mean, I was a bartender at the Catholic Life Center, at, you know, parties and things like that. All kinds of work things. HEBERT: So you had to work to put yourself through, to pay your way through college? HAMILTON: Oh yes! Yes. I mean I had, I did get loans but mostly it was work study, work study and loans. And, I mean, that gets you your books and it gets your tuition but . .. HEBERT: It doesn't give you any living expenses. HAMILTON: No. And I also worked at, the best job I had, I guess, when I was in college was with the Baton Rouge Consumer Protection Center. I worked at Consumer  6  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A Protection Center, I guess, from 1972 through about 1975, I think, I think it was about '75. But that was a good job, an interesting job. I liked it. And it was geared . . . At the time, I knew I was going to be going to law school. I'd already made up my mind to do so, and it made that job better because I was working in, as an investigator, resolving consumer complaints, doing studies. So it was, it was helpful, and it was more hands-on, practical-look- at problems and problem solving. So I, it was a good job, I liked that job. HEBERT: Let's go back a little and go back to your early education. Where'd you go to elementary school? HAMILTON: Buchanan Elementary. HEBERT: Buchanan? HAMILTON: Here in Baton Rouge. HEBERT: And it was segregated at the time. HAMILTON: Oh yes. HEBERT: You did, you did go to integrated high schools didn't you? HAMILTON: Yes. But I went to segregated elementary and junior high school. McKinley Junior High School, which is McKinley Middle now. And there's a middle magnet. My daughters, both, my older, my two older daughters both went to McKinley Middle. So it's interesting to me now to see that that school is a middle magnet school and is, I mean, one of the most, one the best schools in town, and one of the most desirous. I mean, it's interesting to even talk with people that I work around now who try to get their kids into McKinley Middle. When I was at McKinley Middle, I don't think anybody was fighting to get their kids in McKinley Middle. But . . . I mean, I enjoyed it. It was a good school. and then after that I went to Robert E. Lee High School. HEBERT: How large was Buchanan Elementary? HAMILTON: Oh God. HEBERT: Did it serve just South Baton Rouge? What I'm asking is . . . HAMILTON: Well, when I started Buchanan, it was the only elementary school in South Baton Rouge. By, I would say, my, oh gosh, I guess it must have been about my fourth grade year, Polk Elementary was built so there were two. But before that it was the only one. For this . . . lower part of South Baton Rouge. There's Park Elementary for the upper part of Baton Rouge, and then there was South Boulevard. But there weren't a great many, so it was a pretty big school. 7  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A HEBERT: Let's talk about Lee High a little bit. Did you have to apply to go to Lee High, or had they desegregated to the point where you could just enter it? HAMILTON: [222] No. When I started Lee High School it was, what, let's see, I guess that was in '65, '66, oh gosh I've got to think now. I guess it must've been '65, '66 . . . '66'67, '67-'68, '68-'69, so it was '66-'67 school year. And actually, they had gone through their second integration plan. My brother, Larry, was at Baton Rouge High School which was in the first integration plan, and the zones changed in each plan. He was at Baton Rouge High, and graduated from Baton Rouge High. I was at Lee High because the zone changed. And it was a choice plan. You had the option of Baton Rouge High or McKinley when he was eligible to go to high school. And it was Lee High or McKinley when I was eligible to go. You had these two schools within a zone, you had a choice. And my parents opted to send us to the integrated school. HEBERT: Did you have any problem getting in? I talked to someone who applied to Baton Rouge High and they, he was, his application was turned down. HAMILTON: No, I didn't have any problems at all. And neither did Larry getting into Baton Rouge High. HEBERT: How were . . . HAMILTON: We had good grades, I don't know whether there was any problem or, we got in. It wasn't any problem in getting in. No. HEBERT: How were you treated once you got there? Was there a large group of black students? HAMILTON: Like shit. HEBERT: You were treated very badly. HAMILTON: Yes. HEBERT: How did that affect you? I mean, did it hurt your grades? HAMILTON: Well, it was really interesting because . . . Well, first of all, we're from an area in South Baton Rouge that it is today, much worse than it was then, but then people kind of thought it was a bad part of town. But it wasn't as really bad as it appeared. But, I, obviously there were people who were going to go the other way. Our parents were more concerned with keeping us away from an element. Given the option, "No, you're not going to go to school and hang around those people and keep them as your friends. You're going to go here." So, there was this big effort to do that. Now that created a problem, not just at the school, because, I mean, obviously, we were at a school where people didn't want us there. But, you had a problem in the 8  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A neighborhood because you didn't go to school with these people anymore, and there was a group of people, a small group of people, who resented the fact that you didn't go to school, not just that you didn't go to school with them, but you were at school with those white folk. You know. "What, you want to be white? You can't come to school with us?" So, you had to deal with these, you know, idiots at school. Then, you have to come home to deal with all these other idiots who were against you because you weren't in school with them, and you were all of a sudden trying to be white. So, it was really kind of an unusual paradox. It was an unusual situation. And I guess, oh, it was maybe my senior year in high school before I felt comfortable with that, I mean, to where it wasn't a real problem because it got to where you weren't able to relax, you couldn't go home and relax. I mean you developed three or four friends who would still be your friends, but mostly you'd have to deal with people you went to school with, who may or may not have lived in your neighborhood, immediate neighborhood. I went to school with black kids who didn't live in my immediate neighborhood. We were friends because, and associated because we all rode the bus together. But, I lived on West Johnson. They may have lived on Louise Street, which is eight or nine blocks from me, which means, you know, they're not the neighborhood. There was no one in my neighborhood who went to Lee High School, in my immediate neighborhood, the people I grew up with, played ball with, that sort of thing. So, I'd have to go outside of that immediate neighborhood to deal with friends that I could deal with everyday, or even talk with, or go, you know, that sort of thing. I mean, there were two or three guys who eventually come back and say, "Hey man, you know, we're sorry these people are doing this to you." But as a general rule most of the people in the neighborhood decided you were like, isolated, you just, because you didn't go to school with them anymore. So you couldn't hang out. So it was kind of weird. And you couldn't hang out with the white kids! HEBERT: No. HAMILTON: No. So it was kind of weird. HEBERT: Did you start, in the second integration plan, was it all through high school? Did you start out as a freshman at Lee High? HAMILTON: Actually as a sophomore. McKinley went to ninth grade, so actually I started in tenth grade and stayed at Lee High throughout. HEBERT: Now, the first integration plan was started with seniors, did it not? HAMILTON: [224] Well, it started with high school. Well, the first one, yes, started with the seniors, but as that plan developed it moved from seniors to freshmen, you know, seniors, juniors, sophomores, freshmen, but the zones changed, was the key thing. I mean, your home may have been in, like I mentioned earlier in Baton Rouge High School's, attendance zone in the first plan, when the change, the plans changed, you weren't. And so, that was a bigger problem for us because actually our zones changed  9  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A three times. I mean, once you were in you were there. They didn't say, "Oh, my goodness, you got to move now. Go to your respective school." But my brother, Gregory, would have been, I'm trying to remember which school, but he wouldn't be in Lee High zone again. And he was only a year behind me. But his attendance zone was McKinley and, God, I forget, I can't remember what it was, but it was weird, because he opted to go to McKinley. I mean all three of us went to different high schools, and one of the reasons he opted to go because it was like, "Hey, why should we all be at three different schools? No. And just stop." Then, plus, he didn't like the experience that we were going through, and he wasn't going to go through it. He just told my parents, "No." He wasn't going to do that. HEBERT: And your parents allowed him to choose McKinley? HAMILTON: Right. By that time they were at least sympathetic to the fact that it wasn't pleasant. You had to go to school everyday. So it was like hey, you know, it was like, "Okay, okay, they're not having a good time with it but they're going to stay. You can go to McKinley." HEBERT: You describe the bussing. It was segregated bussing. HAMILTON: Oh yes. HEBERT: How were you treated at school? You say you were treated very badly. What were some, can you give me some examples of things people did? HAMILTON: Oh God. Outside from being isolated, I mean, you were taunted all the time. I'll give you an example. There was a joke that white kids used to play, it used to piss me off, I mean the absolute worst one I ever . . . I'll always remember this thing because it was like the first winter we were there. And you know how cold, phlegm, they'd spit in the ceiling, and then call you over to talk so it'd drop on your head. Okay? Now I saw it done to, it never happened to me, but I saw it done to two people. It really pissed me off, okay. And I remember the first rainy day in P.E. and there was this game, battle ball, because when it was raining you're indoors and you had to be in the gym. Coach Fairchild had this game, battle ball, which apparently they'd played before. I'd never seen battle ball, but it's like dodge ball, except the idea is you get the juniors and the seniors on one team, and it's the guys, and the freshmen and the sophomores on one team. The girls are all sitting, and you push the bleachers in, the girls sit around the top of the bleachers or on the side lines. And there are nine volleyballs placed in the middle of the floor and the bleachers on one side, the freshmen and the sophomores, the bleachers on the other side, juniors and seniors. The object is to hit each other with the balls, it's like dodge ball. And obviously, you know, you scramble for the balls and you, and then, there's like a barrier, a line at which you're not supposed to cross, like that chair, between that chair and the bleachers. At some point everyone all had, one team has all the balls, and you're backed  10  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A against the bleachers, and the other guys are taking shots at you. And the deal was to get all, everybody out and save the black guys for last, you know. First of all, it's embarrassing because all these girls are up there, you know, looking at you. You couldn't, you couldn't fake getting hit or try to get hit, you know. The coach would make you go back in. "No no no, you have to go back in." So it would always be the situation where they save the black guys for last. And so there are like six or seven of us and all these guys with these balls staring down at you. You know with these volleyballs, and, you know, you're raring back to take somebody's head off. It was one the most degrading, and embarrassing and, I mean, I was the most hacked off person. I hated that game, okay. Absolutely. Never liked it, never, can't believe that they allow people to do that. I just thought that was asinine, I mean, it really pissed me off. But, I mean, just, that's nothing compared to some of the real stuff, I mean these people were assholes. Okay? I mean I'm talking, every damn minute of the day you had to deal with some idiot, you know, not just calling you "nigger" or, or, or, tripping you or pushing you or doing some crap to you, you know, and some teacher saying, "Well, well you're just going to have to take that." And you can't argue, or you can't do . . . You know, that is what pissed me off about the first year. The second year it got a little better because you'd been around them a lot, and some people felt like, "Well gee, that's wrong." You know, some, maybe five per cent. Most people just didn't care or they were against you. It's interesting to me that my ten-year class reunion, high school class reunion, I didn't want to go. My wife made me go, "Leo, come on, go." I guess in my class let's see, in my graduating class, there were, gee, I can't remember how many of us there were. But it was less than thirty, it was less than thirty, it was . . . only five of us went. I was not willing to see any of those damn people anymore. I was like, "Good, gone, screw them." It was interesting to me when I did go how little they remembered, how little they remembered how mean they were. I was really . . . It was obvious the ones who did, because of how reluctant they were to deal with, because they didn't know how you felt or did you remember, but it was an eerie uncomfortable feeling because so many people didn't remember. I mean, what, would walk up to you as if you'd been old buddies, you know. Somebody you want to punch out. HEBERT: They blocked out what they had done. HAMILTON: [304] You know, "I remember you." You know, "What are you talking to me for now? You'd better get away. Or I might just punch your ass out." I was really that upset about it. I didn't have a good ten-year one. Twenty-year class reunion was better. Primarily because, I think, everyone was more satisfied with themselves. People did remember and, I think, were more resigned to who they were and were ready to deal with who they had been. Actually, I enjoyed my twenty-year class reunion. Actually, the same five of us went too, but it was better. It was much more relaxed, and . . . Of course, over the course of the twenty years, I'd seen some of these people in and out of careers, lives, businesses, the whole thing. So, I mean, we were more at ease with each other and the ones who had been my friends, if you can say friends, because I guess I did have some friends, five or six, who I consider friends, and the ones who I think were amiable were,  11  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A were closer because they were amiable in high school, some of them I even went to college with, so we we're friends now. HEBERT: Now, these are white students? HAMILTON: Oh yes. Oh yes! HEBERT: I was confused for a second. HAMILTON: Yes. No, no, no, I mean, black students, there's a camaraderie there. I mean, even though there were some of us who had never been friends, before or after, but there's a camaraderie. You didn't have this . . . If, if, if one thing that experience did, it was make a camaraderie with people you might not otherwise have been comrades or friends, or you might not even want to be around. Because, I mean, some of those people I probably wouldn't have liked. Period. We just weren't compatible, but, you know. You're sort of forced into a position where you're all facing the same thing, and you understand each other. So, you have to develop a camaraderie, so, there was a camaraderie involved there. And . . . but I'm talking white kids when I say all these things, I mean they were they were really mean. Okay? HEBERT: Right. Well, I understood that. But I wasn't clear on the friends. Your white friends. How were . . . did you-all hang out together at school? Did you ever hang out with a few white friends? You said you had a few of them that you're still friends with now. HAMILTON: Hang out, no. But, I mean, when I say friends, there were . . . I can name them. I can name Ogden. I can name Needa . . . I was in the choir. I was in the a capella choir which develops a camaraderie. I mean, there were people that when I say friends, I mean, as much as you can be friends in high school. People that would talk with you because you were in the choir together or P.E. together that you could talk. Otherwise, they didn't talk. So, there were people who were amiable with you. I consider them at least, I mean, I'm talking about white kids here, as close as you're going to get as a friend in high school. Other people just wouldn't talk to you at all. So no, it was not a question of "hanging out," it was a question of whether they talked. HEBERT: Okay. HAMILTON: [349] Okay, it's like, you're not there, and "If I am going to talk at you, it's going to be telling you that you ought not be here and you ought to get your, get the hell on out of here." You know, so no, there wasn't any that "hang out" type thing. Oh no. Even though, I will say that as I became a senior, I did notice that say, in the freshmen class there were people who began to hang out, so you could see a change. HEBERT: So you were a senior right around like 1968? HAMILTON: Sixty-nine. HEBERT: Sixty-nine.  12  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A HAMILTON: So, I could see it changing. But not my class. I mean, by the time I was a senior, I guess there were a few people who would hang out, in a sense. They'd talk to you, but that's not hanging out. HEBERT: No, that's . . . HAMILTON: They'd talk to you. They'd carry on a conversation. I mean, I'm talking about, you sit in a class and nobody talks to you, you know, or you walk the halls and nobody talks to you, or, you know, you're in P.E. . . . HEBERT: And no one talks to you. HAMILTON: They talk at you but they're not talking to you. No. HEBERT: What about the teachers? How did the teachers treat you? HAMILTON: A couple of them were horrible and obviously racist and obviously unfair. HEBERT: In giving out grades and . . . HAMILTON: Oh yes, because . . . I had a teacher give me an "F" once on a paper because she said, "You can't write that good, and I know you didn't do this. And you're going to have to do this again." And I did it again and I got a "D." Okay? So, I mean, I had teachers who did that to me, and I had teachers who would side with the students, who would almost egg on the students to do things to you. Then, you had teachers who just ignored things. Maybe one or two teachers who were, I thought, good teachers. I mean, I did have two or three good teachers who decided their job was to teach and they weren't going to care who you were. But there were others, those other kind of people involved in there. P.E. teachers, I had a couple of asinine P.E. teachers. I mean like the battle ball stuff. But I mean I'm talking teachers who would see kids do things to you and just walk on by . . . HEBERT: Ignore it. HAMILTON: And if you looked like you were getting ready to retaliate would come over and slap you across your head and say, "I'll put you out of school." That sort of stuff. I mean, so yes. You, you've got a mixture because, I mean, you got a mixture of people. But clearly, there were some people who were unfair, who were clearly unfair. But I can't say there weren't any good teachers who did their job. There were some. HEBERT: How were your grades throughout school? Were they . . . HAMILTON: My grades were okay, my grades were fine. I was an honor student.  13  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A HEBERT: So, it didn't really deter from your grade point average or anything or . . . HAMILTON: No. I mean I had a, what, 3.4, 3.3 average, you know. HEBERT: That's great. HAMILTON: [390] So, I mean, I was a pretty good student. But I was always a pretty good student. I liked school. You know, I wasn't . . . and it didn't, it didn't hurt that I, I had to go home and study. What was I going to do? HEBERT: Right. Right. HAMILTON: You know, I couldn't go out and hang out. So it was easy. But my parents made us study. So, I had to study. I wasn't allowed to do anything until I studied. I'd come home, study, and then, I'd worry about going out and play ball or whatever I was going to do. Generally, if I was going to do that it meant usually I had to worry about calling Greg or Byron or somebody who was from another part of town and say, "Hey man", you know, "can you, can you, can someone come pick me up or can your dad come get me?" so I can go play ball over there with those guys. Because it was maybe my sophomore, summer between my sophomore and junior year, before I really felt comfortable playing ball in my neighborhood again. I mean, people would get rough on you. I mean they . . . I had fights in my neighborhood because I wasn't . . . HEBERT: You weren't going to the same school. HAMILTON: . . . going to school with them anymore. And all of a sudden you go to that white school, that kind of stuff. But it was really summer before I could go out there and play ball with them. Then you kind of go out and they, "Well, don't pick him. Pick me." Then you have to worry about waiting for your up because somebody's got to pick you to go up with them, you know, it's like, "Oh, shit". But, you know . . . it's part of growing up. HEBERT: Right. So what were some of your favorite subjects in school? Did you have any . . . HAMILTON: Early in school, I liked science subjects, but then, I liked history and English subjects . . . HEBERT: Did you . . . HAMILTON: . . . and social sciences. HEBERT: Did you know that you were going to go to law school when you were in high school? Had you decided that yet?  14  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A Or . . . HAMILTON: No, not really. I guess . . . I honestly didn't know what I was going to do, but my dad, when he was in the military had gotten all these books, I guess when he was in the Second World War, and he had a whole bunch of books that were in our attic, I remember. One of them was a law book, some kind of book, business law, or something. And . . . I just remember reading through it. I thought it was interesting, and we talked about it. And he really sort of brushed it aside. But . . . so it was in the back of my mind, I guess. But I really liked the sciences more then. Then, once I got to college and more involved in social consciousness, law school became more real to me than anything else. Because once I got to college, I got involved in campus activities, campus life, that kind of stuff, to the degree that I was concerned that we weren't involved in it. And . . . politics, I got more involved in that sort of thing. So, political science was my area and once in political science, law school became more of an option than anything else. By, by my sophomore year, I knew I was going to be in political science, and I knew that I wanted to do something in the social science areas. HEBERT: Let's talk about LSU now. We, we talked a little bit about why you came, and let's talk about financing. You said it was a financial hardship for you to come to LSU. Was it, did it hurt your parents, was it a financial hardship on your parents? HAMILTON: [440] Well, they couldn't afford it. HEBERT: So . . . HAMILTON: That's the first thing. I mean, obviously they couldn't afford to send us to college although they wanted us to go. My first semester here I was eligible for work study my first year. So, I did qualify to get work study and a loan. And really went through college on that. HEBERT: Was there any scholarship options? HAMILTON: No. HEBERT: No. Harambe, later on, tried to change that, didn't it? Didn't it protest against the lack of scholarships granted to minority students? HAMILTON: Yes, we did do that. It was a concern that the financial aid options were so limited and that there was really not an effort to make the financial aid options available and known. You know, it's kind of like recruitment, I mean, it is recruitment. You have to . . . at the high school level, inform kids of these things. We didn't have good guidance counselors. Well, I shouldn't say we didn't have good ones. There wasn't the effort at Lee High School to make all options known to black kids. My guidance counselor didn't make a whole bunch available to me. I went in there and I asked for things, and I got what I asked for . . .  15  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A HEBERT: Did they try . . . HAMILTON: . . . but if I didn't ask for the right thing I wasn't going to get it! HEBERT: Did they push for you to go to Southern, your guidance counselors, or did they try to discourage you from coming to LSU? HAMILTON: They didn't care one way or the other. If I didn't ask for anything, I didn't get anything. Period. And no one said . . . I mean, when I went . . . My mom and dad said, "Find out what your college options are. See what you can do in terms of getting some money to go to college because we can't afford it." They gave . . . I went in, asked my guidance counselor for information about schools, yes, Southern, and initially, she gave me Southern. I said, "Well, I'd like to see some other schools." That's when I got all the other stuff. Okay? So, I mean, I got stuff that I asked for. I can't say I didn't get stuff. HEBERT: But she automatically handed you the stuff for Southern. HAMILTON: [480] Oh, well, yes. And, I mean, I assumed that's what they all thought we were going to do, or I was going to go. But that has never really been an option for me. I honestly did not grow up with an affinity for it or a kinship to it. You have to realize, Southern is in North Baton Rouge. Within the black community there is a sort of, or was, clearly then, I don't about as much now, but there was clearly sort of a rivalry or competitiveness between North and South Baton Rouge, as is in the white community. Southern's reach was more so in the black schools, first, and I was not in a black school, and beyond the black schools, North Baton Rouge, Southern Heights, the more affluent areas of the black community and in the black middle class. Actually, Southern in the upper black middle class was not an option. Howard was the option. Howard or Morehouse. Southern really was kind of more middle, but like teachers, not doctors, not as much, lawyers, yes, but not doctors. Doctors, Meharry, Howard, that thing. But law school, Southern. And if you had any sort of options it was more one of the SWAC schools, South West Athletic Conference schools. Alcorn . . . HEBERT: Grambling. HAMILTON: Grambling, but Southern, Grambling principally. Once I wasn't in that environment anymore, you don't get the pull. You know, once I moved outside of the segregated school system, you're outside of the loop. So, I didn't have that Southern thing, or the . . . just the feel of it, because you don't get that really until high school. So I wasn't around that, you know. I didn't go to the football games, and . . . I went to the track meets because I like track, but I, it just wasn't anything that was really big for me. I had friends there, and I had relatives there. I mean, I had relatives that played on the football team and stuff like that. But it wasn't something that I went . . . My dad was not a big football person. My dad's a baseball guy, okay? He likes baseball; he didn't like football. So, I didn't go to Southern football games every weekend like lots of other kids do. I didn't develop that camaraderie or feel for the school. Like I said, in all honesty, I sat on my front steps and listened to the LSU football, I could hear the game  16  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A from my . . . HEBERT: From your house. HAMILTON: Oh, I could hear Sid Crocker from my front steps. So, I listened to games at home on Saturday nights. I'd be listening to the LSU game, they're all listening to or watching the Southern game. So, you know, I really had a closer kinship to this school. HEBERT: To LSU. HAMILTON: As my brothers and I, we all did. HEBERT: It's time for me to flip . . .  17														Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections, LOUISiana Digital Library, Baton Rouge, La.

Begin Tape 453, Side B.] HEBERT: [005] Let's . . . Can you describe your first day on campus to me, as a student? HAMILTON: Oh gosh. One thing I remember about my first day on campus was there was only one class where I wasn't the only black student. The classes were big, real big, and it was kind of cold. But it wasn't the same sort of feeling at, like in, like Lee High, at Lee High School, or in high school. Because it was so big, there wasn't the immediate feeling of this group of people on your back. I mean, it was, people were indifferent, more or less. There wasn't this feeling that every white kid walking around you was either going to beat up on you or was so overly resentful about you. I mean, it just wasn't there, it was too big. You know, high school there's this closeness, and it's really immediate. You didn't have, I mean, it didn't feel bad, I mean, I liked it, I really did. Since I had worked that summer, remember, with the Higher Education Facilities Commission, I was familiar with the campus. I mean, hell, I knew every building on the campus. So it, I didn't have any bad feelings about it at all. I felt great. I don't know if every other minority or black student had that feeling because they were coming from smaller towns, from segregated schools, you know. I had come from an integrated school environment which I thought helped, really helped. I thought it made it easier an adjustment, and I'm sure now that I recall the interactions with other students who didn't have the integrated environment or hadn't come from an integrated school environment. I wasn't intimidated by the teachers or the methodology of doing things, it just was school. I mean, I kind of liked it. HEBERT: How many black students were on campus at that time? Just a general idea. HAMILTON: Oh Jesus! HEBERT: A hundred? Two hundred? HAMILTON: Gosh, let me think by classes. Maybe two hundred. Maybe two hundred. Large freshman class. Not as large sophomore. And there were some graduate students that I, you didn't get to see. So, I'd say maybe two hundred. HEBERT: Was there a camaraderie among black students here at LSU, the same kind that had existed at Lee High?  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HAMILTON: Oh yes, more so. Actually, Harambe had gotten started, I think the year before, in '68, '67, and there was an effort to, to identify black students and get you aware that there was, that there were other black students, that there was a home-type thing where you could at least talk to people. I mean, obviously, the same inability to talk, to relate to people was a problem, and you wanted to be . . . School's like anything else, you want to interact with people, you want to, there's a social part of it. They were concerned that everybody understood that there was an avenue for some social interaction, and so there was an effort to identify who we were. There was even a convocation. HEBERT: Oh really? I don't remember reading about that. HAMILTON: I can't remember. I shouldn't say a convocation because convocation gives the idea that it was sponsored by the university, but it wasn't. It was sponsored by the students, by Harambe, and this group. I mean, there was a meeting, I should say, I guess is the word, because there were leaflets and "Hey, come to the meeting." That kind of thing. HEBERT: Did you . . . HAMILTON: And we all went to the meetings. HEBERT: Did you ever belong to the Martin Luther King Action Movement, or did that die out . . . HAMILTON: That was not . . . Well, let's see . . . HEBERT: It died out right around that the time you got here. HAMILTON: [042] Yes, because, in '69 Harambe was, like, taking over that. The Martin Luther King Action Movement was considered at the time a little too . . . meek. There was an effort to get more aggressive. The Martin Luther King Action . . . There were some people, because I remember the conflict. The people who were in the Martin Luther King Action Movement geared at . . . which, which, most of the times they used to meet over at the Episcopal Center and at the Catholic Center. They were not aggressive enough for the newer group of people. The thing about the Harambe group was it was a more aggressive, activist approach, looking more toward identifying with the more really radical groups in the civil rights movement at that time, identifying more with SNCC than with the NAACP. That type thing. And . . . or identifying more with the Panthers, or stuff like that, you know. It was . . . the idea was "Hey, the movement is moving this way not that way. That's pass. No, let's go this way." So Harambe was the thing. HEBERT: And Harambe was an all black group? HAMILTON: Oh yes.  2  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HEBERT: And Martin Luther King Action Movement was an integrated group, wasn't it? HAMILTON: Yes, right. HEBERT: Was there some feeling in the Martin Luther King Action Movement that the white students were taking over and, and directing it . . . HAMILTON: Well . . . I don't know if it was that they thought they were taking over. I think, and I'm thinking about people like Charles Cochraham and Johnny Gill when I think about that. I think, and Ron Johnson, those guys were of the opinion that the movement for black people has no place for white people. You can not identify this struggle, you, therefore can not participate in it. You may sympathize, fine. But you can't sympathize, and assist because once you get involved in it you want it to go your way, and it's not going to go your way. You're not going to direct. We're not going to . . . if we disagree with you it's because we know best. There was this conflict, there was this real conflict. I mean, it's easy to say, "Well, we thought they were taking over". That's not really what was going on. What was going on was a conflict in thought. I mean, you can't, and looking back at it it's easier to see. You can't allow discontent. You know, you can't allow these guys to challenge you when you put something on the table which is what happens. Because, as the movement was changing and discussions within the MLK were going on, you know, people would say, "Well, what do you think about [H.] Rap Brown or what do you think about or what do you think about . . ." shucks, . . . any one of these other guys? HEBERT: James Farmer. Those kinds of people. HAMILTON: "What about the Panthers, you know? Don't you think they were wrong to do such and such?" "Hell no, they weren't wrong!" You know, you'd always have arguments because the white group that was involved in MLK was not really the white group that was the activist, radical white group. HEBERT: Which was the Progressive Student . . . HAMILTON: Which was the peace movement white group. HEBERT: Right. HAMILTON: So, that group was going off in another direction, and you were really left with basically pacifists. And it wasn't going to work. HEBERT: The movement had moved beyond the plane of pacifism.  3  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HAMILTON: [078] The movement had moved beyond that. was the real problem. The real problem was this movement from pacifism to activism to real, God, I don't want to say radical movement because it was characterized as that when it really wasn't. Not here. I mean, nationally it was, but not here. It never really got to that level here. That, I think, characterized the conflict between the peace movement breaking out of the civil rights movement and the civil rights movement moving towards activism. And those coupled together destroyed, I think, the Martin Luther King Action Movement more than anything else. Because the two leaderships, those two groups just took off, I mean, it just took off. HEBERT: Speaking of Martin Luther King, I just thought back, I didn't ask you, were you involved in any of the civil rights organizations during your high school time? HAMILTON: Oh, NAACP. That sort of thing. HEBERT: Never CORE, or SNCC, or SCLC? HAMILTON: No, no, no, no, not them. Not them at all. I mean, you read about it, obviously, and you talk about it but there were no active high school chapters. There were chapters at Southern, and I know friends and had friends who were more involved because they were . . . again, in the loop. I wasn't in the loop at that time. You know, when you weren't in, in a black school, you were kind of out of the loop, and they weren't going to let you in the loop. So, you missed out on that, really, and that was an interesting kind of a concept. The interesting thing to me at that time was the movement was fighting to integrate the country and the people who were placed in the forefront of integration were getting lost, because that effort was no longer the principal goal of the new movement. And it's a tragedy. But that's really kind of what, we were kind of caught in the middle because it was almost . . . The movement was moving towards where we almost are now, towards separatism really. It was moving toward self-identity, self-improvement, even though now I think they lost the idea of self-improvement, but that's another thing. HEBERT: So this was a time when the Black Power Movement was coming out? HAMILTON: Oh yes. The Black Power Movement was, nationally, mid-'60s. Here . . . HEBERT: It happened here later. HAMILTON: I'd say it really took hold here about '67, '67, '68, really took hold here. I mean, we didn't begin to have Afros in Baton Rouge till '70s. You know shucks, I mean, we were kind of slow, you know. I mean, it's Baton Rouge. It didn't really pick on, pick up here till '67, '68, and '69, I mean it really began here. It was like, okay, this movement is going to last, it's for real. So, where I think nationally the heat of the Black Power Movement was '60s, mid '60s, '64-5-6-7-, the heat really wasn't here until '69, '70, '71, '72, that kind of strange time thing.  4  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HEBERT: Well, Baton Rouge is a little slower than the . . . HAMILTON: Oh yes, agreed. HEBERT: Did [H.] Rap Brown being from this area have any effect or any influence on the Black Power Movement here in Baton Rouge? Would he come down . . . HAMILTON: Well, I'll tell you. It didn't have any effect until those time periods that I mentioned. It's too laid back. I mean, people here, first of all you've got to realize his age group didn't buy into it. My age group did. HEBERT: So your age group did, the next generation bought in to it? HAMILTON: Yes. His age group didn't buy into it here. I mean, here. I mean, nationally, yes, but not . . . [H.] Rap Brown was, what, six years older than me. He's six, seven years older than me, so his age group didn't buy into it; my age group bought into it. So that difference in time just between the two of us in a place like Baton Rouge is a significant difference. Guys who were within his age group, a guy like Jody Bivens [?], who was big in the Baton Rouge area in the Black Power struggle, were considered crazy. "These guys are nuts, you know, wild." And . . . HEBERT: Murphy Bell . . . HAMILTON: Kind of wild. I mean, by the time he was big nationally it became obvious to Louisiana. "Oh God, he's from here." "Oh, you know, that guy's from right over there on Grant Street." You know, "Oh man", you know, that kind of thing. He was just another big mouth guy in Baton Rouge for a long time, you know. And then it dawned on the community here at the college level that this guy had credibility and that he was a part of a major movement. I mean, it just was slow getting here. HEBERT: How did certain incidents, such as the march from Bogalusa to Baton Rouge in 1967 affect you? Do you remember those kinds of things? HAMILTON: Oh sure, I remember it. I remember it . . . at the time it was great. I mean, we thought it was outstanding. The idea . . . remember the date on that? What was the date? HEBERT: It's 1967, August thirteenth, fourteenth.  5  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HAMILTON: Right. Okay. I was in high school and it was a big thing, a tremendously big thing. I think it did a whole lot, not just in Baton Rouge, but in the state toward making the state more involved in the national movement. But, the big national movements, big national marches, were when? HEBERT: They were earlier than this, right? HAMILTON: Right. So, again, this is all a part of the fact that the movement was slow getting here. I mean, this was eight to ten years after the movement and marches became considered viable tools nationally. So, I mean, that's a good picture of how the movement is changed. HEBERT: Why do you think it was slower here in Baton Rouge, in Louisiana? HAMILTON: [144] I think it was slower in Louisiana for a number of reasons. One is, the dichotomy of life here. Black people and white people live so closely in practical aspects. I mean, neighborhoods overlap. The "across the track" thing isn't as obvious in many places in Louisiana; it just really isn't. The ability to talk was, I think, part of the problem, and, it was a problem that it was slow. The other thing is, I honestly believe, that we're so ignorant. I mean, we're a poorlyeducated state. We're very, very ignorant. Within the black community, fear of that ignorance and what it could do, that . . . Because I've had, I had teachers talk to me about this. I've gone back and talked to them, people who taught me when I was in junior high school, who said there was a fear that pushing for integration too quickly would hurt the black community. That, yes, we knew it had to be done, but if you pushed too quickly it would hurt the community because we weren't ready. So there was, I think, a feeling among the leadership that we weren't ready. That these people, there are people within this community who understand it has to be done, but we're going to all work together toward that and, that's something you can't control. You just can't control it. I think that there were knowledgeable, concerned people who saw it and who realized it had to happen and that we were a part of it but who wanted to control it in a manner such that it created less conflict. That there was a serious effort to do that. But I think, as anything, of that magnitude, it gets uncontrollable because you can't control people's desires and, ignorant or not, television is there. I mean, you could see it. You're a part of it. Everyday, you go to these churches and you talk. Then, it just snowballed. Then, the fact that there's a college there, a college campus right there, and the fact that that college campus had students from all across the country who came in here telling us how jerks, what big jerks we were, and how slow we were, and I just think it just got out of hand. I think Southern, and tv, brought new leadership, and I think that new leadership was as big a part of it as anything else because the old leadership wanted it to be slow. HEBERT: So the old leadership, say the NAACP-type leaders and the church leaders.  6  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HAMILTON: Well, I mean the NAACP, the church leaders, even the white leaders who were conscious enough of the eventuality of it, who could talk to those black leaders all thought they could control it. I really believe that's what happened. I really believe there was an effort to say, "Okay, we all know this is coming, guys. What's the best way for us to do this so it creates as little turmoil as possible?" And everyone agreed, Well it's got to be gradual." I think there was positioning in such a manner that this was the best way they thought to attack. HEBERT: Who were some of these leaders? HAMILTON: And then, of course, you always had these idiots who just weren't going to see it. That's natural. HEBERT: So who were some of these leaders? Do you think of any . . . HAMILTON: I think of people like Jemison and all of those guys. J. K. [Haynes], L. L. Haynes, all those people. I think they saw this and I think that the march, oh . . . Golly, what's his name, A. Z., all of them. HEBERT: A. Z. Young. HAMILTON: I think they saw it. You know, but I think they had to be convinced that it couldn't happen that way. "That no, even though we do think it has to be gradual, you people are never going to understand it, so no. It's never going to be slow enough for youall. Slow enough for you-all is not fast enough for us." Because the heat was on these guys, I mean, the community began to put heat on. I don't think there's any question about it. The community began to say, "Wait a minute. Are you-all with us, or are you-all with them? What do you mean wait? Wait for how long? Tired of waiting." HEBERT: And the waiters, the people who wanted to wait, were called "Uncle Toms." I've read some . . . newspaper articles about things like that. HAMILTON: Exactly! Exactly! Oh yes. HEBERT: What about the national groups, such as CORE, coming in to Bogalusa, and things like that? HAMILTON: That helped. HEBERT: That helped to push . . . HAMILTON: That helped to push these guys, but I think, that's again, a product of the fact that black college students . . .  7  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HEBERT: Who were involved in these organizations. HAMILTON: Right. Because these guys had connections that were outside of this immediate leadership group. They had connections in other states, nationally. I mean, you know, you're talking about, you have a college campus here. And the consequences of having kids in college makes a difference. I mean, A. Z. probably had to deal with people coming back to Monroe wanting to know what the hell was going on, you know. "Come on Z., what are we doing?" It's it just got out of hand, I think, from their perspective. And that's the way it should be. I don't have any problem with that. HEBERT: So, let's talk about Harambe and your involvement in that organization. Let's see, what's the history of that organization? Is it a national organization, or . . .? HAMILTON: [205] No. No, it's not. Actually, it's a local, here, on the campus. The organization started about '68, '67, between '67 and '68. And was, my freshman year, the first effort to really make a black power statement, a self-consciousness statement. I mean, the really big thing about Harambe was it was part of the movement to emphasize black pride. Harambe, the term is part of an expression, a Swahili expression, "harambe uhuru,": "let's pull together." HEBERT: Okay. HAMILTON: And it was the first effort toward moving back to identifying African roots, the whole thing. It made an effort to look at a global black power struggle, because, I mean, that was the first time there was an emphasis on looking at Africa, South Africa, the problems in Rhodesia, those type things. I mean, they really were like, "Let's educate ourselves on what the struggle is and let's, now, begin to look at actively changing our plight here." So, there were efforts made to say target things that need to be done on this campus. Target people who are best able to get these things done. Let's begin looking at how we're going to do it. And let's begin looking at what's wrong. Let's begin to, instead of sitting around ignoring it or pretending it's not there, or walking around it, let's attack it head on. Like fraternities. We're tired of them, and we're tired of them being the assholes they are, you know, picking on us, using us as the brunt of their jokes, whatever. You know, let's go at them. Let's not have it anymore. I mean, it was a really activist attempt to deal with it. HEBERT: How did you go after fraternities? HAMILTON: [229] Well, first thing is, we decided to approach the administration about some of the things the fraternities were doing. Like the, the, well, the biggest thing . . . I was trying to figure out what the biggest thing. The biggest thing we were mad about at the time was this football party weekend deal where they, just, really they did some really racist kind of things in those days. I mean, they used to, like, hang black people in effigy  8  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B and stuff. And, I mean, they used to do some goddamn weird things, and even at . . . At football games, if there were black players on other teams, they'd scream, "Niggers" and hang effigies and do all kinds of wild-ass things. Okay? And not to mention, you couldn't walk by, if you were black, you couldn't walk by the fraternity house. I mean, they'd harass you, harangue you. Well, I mean, on occasions have attacked people after football games, okay? So it was like, "Look, hey, these people are going rampant over there. You-all got to do something about this foolishness." That whole confederate slavery thing, you know, attacking that kind of nonsense. I mean, believe me, these people today still talking about the flag, nothing compared to what those people used to do then, okay? Believe me. I mean, they were, they were asinine. They were . . . That situation was as bad as when I was in high school. Those people were just stupid. Drunk assholes is what they used to be. And it was just ridiculous. And then there was the concern about this not being able to participate in things, like fraternities. Black-balling. I mean, there were some black kids who wanted to be in fraternities and sororities. Not going to be. . . HEBERT: And attempted to join these. HAMILTON: Yes. And attempted to join. And were embarrassed, harassed, and the whole thing. Because, you know, during those days, everybody got rush letters. You didn't know that when you got a damn letter that you went down to rush they were going to treat you like shit! You come down there thinking you got a chance to be in a fraternity or a sorority. And these people were really asinine to these people. I mean, awful, okay? That sort of thing. It was awful, okay? I mean, they were really awful people. HEBERT: And so Harambe contacted which organizations? HAMILTON: [257] Well, we started with, we started with Dean Reddoch. Jerk! You know, and he was not sympathetic nor did he consider it a problem! I mean, he was like, well, you know, he was just really a jerk, okay. Then, we decided we needed to just go . . . I mean, going through these channels and, we decided, "Hey, stop. We just need to take this to the chancellor." We went to Chancellor Taylor, who was a nice man, really nice man, but Chancellor Taylor was not confrontational. Just wanted to believe the best way was for everybody to try to kind of work things out. Real nice man, who preferred to not be involved in any confrontation. So a lot wasn't getting done, okay. It wasn't getting done. And ultimately, I mean, we had a sit-in, I think, in his office one time, where he did assign some people to work with us and try to identify problems. Don Tarver was the guy, I think, he assigned to work with us and begin attacking some of these things. And begin looking at why black students were not allowed to participate in the social part of this campus. Because, I mean, that was . . .  9  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B In all honesty, I didn't consider it that a big a problem. Two, one, because I'd gone through this. It's like, "Hey, hang these people!" I mean, this big campus is big enough to do what I'm going to do, and if they don't get in front of me I don't give a darn. I mean, that was really my original approach to the whole thing as an individual. Secondly, the way I looked at it, if we worked hard enough at it, it was going to work despite them. I just didn't care that they were going to be jerks. I'd lived with that before. The way you deal with them is you make them out to be the jerks they are and let everybody see they're jerks. Sooner or later, it's going to work against them. But, you know, you've got more people concerned about it, you got a bigger campus, which means the problem might take longer to be recognized and solved so you have to work on it. That's when we decided, well, okay, some of these people wanted chapters from Southern to come in and begin setting up chapters here so we had to work with the administration to allow them to do that, and to become a part of the Interfraternity Council. I never joined one those things. I don't believe in fraternities, sororities. I don't believe in that. I just think that's nonsense. I think that whole idea creates atmosphere for conflicts because they create these elitist cliques. I mean, I'm sorry, but that's my feeling on it. HEBERT: But you thought if students wanted to join those fraternities then they had every right to join them. HAMILTON: Well, they ought to have a right to do it. You can have a right to do whatever the devil you want to do. No, not whatever the devil, but if you want to join . . . HEBERT: I know what you mean. HAMILTON: [291] Yes, fine. I helped them do that. I was a part of a group that said, "Okay, fine. You-all want to be in these things, fine, but I assure you they did more harm than good, in my feelings. HEBERT: These . . . How'd you get to be the president of Harambe? You ran in your sophomore year, did, were you elected your sophomore year? HAMILTON: Summer of my sophomore year. It was interesting because, in all honesty, I didn't, I didn't want to do it, initially, because I had a different approach than the other group who was in who . . . When I came into this school, as I mentioned earlier, there were like two groups of black students: those who had gone to integrated schools and those who had not. And just as I had the problem in Baton Rouge, "Those of you-all who went to white schools, you-all think you're white," there was that feeling on the campus from those students who didn't go to white school. "Well, then what the hell are you doing here now?" You know, that kind of stuff. It created a different approach toward things. I believed then, I believe now, sure there are a lot of jerks here who will never get it and there are a lot of people here who it will take a great deal to get them to see, but there are people here who will work with us. We  10  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B just, we have to find them. The other thing is, the university has to make this work, or the university is going to fall. Period. And the people in administration know that. We just have to make them understand that we are going to help it fall if you don't get involved in this, okay? So get involved in this. Their approach was, "Screw the whole thing, let's just make them understand it by beating them over the head." Well, if you beat everybody over the head too much you're never going to help, they're just always going to be against you. That was my, and it was, it was a conflict that was apparent and at that time, about to get really bad. Actually, a couple of people said, "Man, you ought to run." Because I have a big mouth. I used to get in arguments with this other group a lot. So, okay, I'll run. At the time there was also the feeling that, "Well, gee, it's all going to fall apart any damn way because this place is so awful they're going to kill us. They're going to make it fall apart." So, there was this challenge to try to make the thing work, and that's really kind of how it happened. HEBERT: Who were some of the other leaders? I've read Dale, Dale Marcelle's name. Marcelle. HAMILTON: Dale was involved. You mean in Harambe? HEBERT: In Harambe. HAMILTON: Oh gosh, let's see. Johnny Gill, Charles Cochraham . . . HEBERT: Ivory T. Walker, was he in Harambe? Or . . . it seems Ivory . . . HAMILTON: Yes. Frank Roubleau, Harold Deselle . . . HEBERT: Were there very many women in Harambe? HAMILTON: Yes, yes. Barbara Favorite, Maleka, I forgot what her name was before Maleka . . . HEBERT: What about Jacqueline Jones? HAMILTON: Yes, Jackie. Louanna Peters [?]. Last time I saw Louanna [?], she was working for a congressman, Gus Savage. Awful man, but she was working for him. Gosh, I've forgotten that other girl's name, too. Because there were really a lot of women. HEBERT: Gwendolyn, Gwendolyn, someone named Gwendolyn. I came across the name last night.  11  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HAMILTON: Gosh, and I just saw this lady. She's at Southern. She works at Southern now. But there were a lot of women. In fact, there were more women leaders than men, really. HEBERT: Really? There was also an effort, on the part of the women, to change dorm, housing rules and stuff on campus. Well, treatment in housing. HAMILTON: Right. Well, there was an effort to change everything. To be honest about it. HEBERT: Everything, that's right. What about the Black Cultural Center? That was a fight that Harambe won. HAMILTON: Yes. The Cultural Center idea came up during, I guess '71, '72, after, after the marches and after the, I can't remember whether it happened after the students died at Southern . . . HEBERT: Let me check. HAMILTON: But, golly. HEBERT: I think it was . . . HAMILTON: No, it was before. HEBERT: It was before. It was 1971. HAMILTON: [355] It was before. But, when we, it was after, it was after a sit-in in the Chancellor's office, that's when it was. After we did that, there was this effort, again, as I was saying, to get black people more involved in the social aspect of the campus and to get the white students and the state to recognize the contributions of black people to the state and to the university. I mean it's like, "Look, you have this Afro-, this AngloAmerican art museum over here, this natural science museum over here that extols everything except the contributions of black people. This ought to be about providing, the state and the university community, some information about the role of black people in this state." Now that was a big fight because, and I mean a big fight within the group, first, because within the group, the initial move was a BSU, a Black Student Union. That was then initial call. The initial call was, "We need a BSU" because BSU's were popular all over the country. There was a group, a small group that disagreed with that, that thought the BSUs were counter- productive because BSUs promote separatism, more so than integration. And that it doesn't, in the long run, aid in your total campus involvement, it just isolates you more. Big, big, big fight about that, but we won. The group won that wanted a center as opposed to a BSU. We put the idea to the campus, was able to get,  12  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B campus administration, was able to get assigned some property, was able to get some assistance from the architecture and, what do you call that darn school, the School of Environmental Design, to help us come up with a design for the project, an initial fund-raising project, and just get the idea off the ground. But it was always conflict, always. Because there was always the group that wanted the BSU lingering and upset, festering, because they always thought that idea didn't work. The idea was, involved white people. It involved something of an integrationist concept more akin to the old Martin Luther King Action Movement fight than what we ought to be about, which is Black Power, self-identity, black pride, the whole thing. Johnny Gill . . . Johnny Duncan started leading that group. Johnny became a real big spokesman, Johnny and Terry Bonnie, Johnny Duncan and Terry Bonnie became real big spokespersons for that group. And the younger members began to move toward that more. As anything, you know, it changes, you got transition. They just believed that the idea of integration was the wrong way to go, that the idea of desegregation was the way to go. And there's a distinct difference. Desegregation means removal of forced barriers. That's all. Integration means something much broader than that, much broader than that. It actually means working together. Some, some effort, at merging ideas, philosophies, people, and interacting. They weren't about that. I don't mean it to say that they were right or wrong as much as they didn't agree. As much as from their background and perspectives, they didn't see it accomplishing anything. They were part of a group, Johnny was a part of a group who came from an integrated environment in high school, which was very unsuccessful. Unsuccessful, not in the sense that they didn't put the bodies there, but unsuccessful in the sense that they didn't get people working together. It was violent. It was always confrontational. Those people . . . It never got beyond where my initial high school years got. I mean, I saw through my high school years it getting better. I mean, it may have gotten worse by now, I don't know. But they never saw it even getting better. I mean, they never got to where they even saw people hanging out or talking to each other. They had a lot of bitterness, a significant amount of bitterness. Their feeling was, "These people will never do right. They will never want us to succeed. They will always do their most, utmost, to keep us down." I mean, that's just their feeling. Like I said, I don't know if they're right or they're wrong, I mean, but that's . . . There's a significant . . . There was a significant amount of animosity and hate in that. I could see that group moving up. My senior after that, I mean, Johnny became president. HEBERT: That's right. HAMILTON: And I think that had a lot to do with what happened after that. HEBERT: So the Cultural Center never became a reality?  13  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HAMILTON: No, because what happened after I left was, and we had set up an initial, as I mentioned we had a fund raiser, set up an account . . . HEBERT: And you had a house corporation . . . HAMILTON: Fund-raising, and we had to set up a corporation and so forth. Too much stuff, in their vernacular, "No. White folks stuff. No." They moved back toward the idea of a BSU, and there was a building off campus. The darn union building was using it as a storage and supply place at the time. Johnny always wanted things now. He wasn't about patience. They opted to buy the building with the funds that we had and, not buy the building, but opted to swap the property on Dalrymple Drive for the property over on Highland Road and to use the monies to renovate the building. And it became a BSU. The disheartening thing to me, more than anything, more than his idea winning out over my idea, one way or the other, was that I lived, at that time, in those apartments right across the street from that place. God, I've forgotten the name of those darn things. They were townhouse apartments. Tiger Townhouse, I think? Yes. Everyday, I had to walk out there and see that building. They all gathered together one Saturday afternoon, and I watched them. They painted it red, black, and green, which was the flag of the struggle at the time. It was more green than anything, but. But it was awful. I mean, it was like, everyday I would get out of my house, every morning, and I had to walk past that damn building. I was like, "Jesus Christ!" And everyday I'd have to deal with the fact that this is not going to work. This is counter-productive. I watched it just go down, and down, and down. I say that, not, again, not meaning that I think that Johnny meant anything wrong or anything bad, because he didn't. He honestly didn't. He believed in what he was saying. And his experiences, I think, had a great deal to do with his believing that. He had no reason to believe that integration was ever going to work. He had no reason to trust white people. I mean he had no reason to do that. HEBERT: What part of the state was he from? Do you remember? HAMILTON: Bogalusa. HEBERT: Oh, okay. HAMILTON: He had no reason to believe that. There's a number of other people who have no reason to believe that. That's the tragedy of it, because any effort to make a longterm program that is student-based is difficult because you have transition. You have people in and out of school, the whole thing. It depends, so much, on support from outside. You cannot garner that kind of support if you don't, one, show responsibility, and two, make a conscious effort to show that you're prepared to cooperate with people. He never understood that. He never saw the next day. He only saw today, and that's a real problem. But he was an honest, sincere guy, in all respects. But, you know, you just have different view points.  14  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 453, Side A. Begin Tape 453, Side B HEBERT: Well, we've about finished up this tape . . . [End Tape 453, Side B.

Transcript Hamilton 471A										Narrator: Leo Hamilton 4700.0322 Interviewer: Mary Hebert Session II Transcriber: Robin Cate 11 September 1993 [Begin Tape 471, Side A. Begin Session II.] HEBERT: [002] This is Mary Hebert. It is September eleventh, 1993, and I'll be talking to Leo Hamilton and we're at Hill Memorial Library on LSU's campus. Last time we were talking about Harambe and we covered a lot of the more political aspects of it, or the social aspects of it. What about Harambe as a social organization? Was that a big role? HAMILTON: Oh sure. There really wasn't any social life outside of Harambe, the Martin Luther King Action Movement, and I would say the churches, the Episcopal Center, the Baptist Student Center, the Student Union, and maybe the Catholic Center. But a significant part of what Harambe did was social because it was so easy to make the social and the cultural aspect of it work. And so much of what we were concerned about was feeling needed, feeling wanted, feeling that you could live, you could survive here. It wasn't just a question of whether of were you going to pass the courses or hang around on the campus. I mean, people just kind of felt alone, so you had to use that to develop a social point of view. HEBERT: You would meet a lot at St. Alban's, the Episcopal Center. How'd you go about getting that to be one of the meeting places out there? HAMILTON: Actually, it just happened, originally. It just became, it was a place where people studied. Then, Father Wood, Chuck Wood, was a really, really, nice guy. And he talked to people. He took the opportunity to speak with the students and . . . Recognizing that it had become, I guess de facto, a place that people sort of hung out in, eventually, he offered us the opportunity to use one of those rooms as a meeting room. It became meeting and social, the whole thing, which was a large, multi-purpose type room, I really don't know what Chuck and those guys had used it for previously. Then, the other center would have been the Wesley Center where Will Fennan [?] was over there at the time. HEBERT: That's the Methodist . . . HAMILTON: Yes, that's the Methodist Center. I'm Methodist, so, I met Will, really through my minister. Actually, his center became a focal point because they had Sunday meals, Sunday evenings. The membership at University Methodist would sponsor these Sunday meals for the students. Great meals! I mean, these ladies would come in and fix these outstanding meals on Sunday night, and you couldn't beat it, I mean, it's free! So,  1  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A that became another area where, I mean, we went from the meals . . . Then, Will was also interested in promoting more integration and diversity on the campus. So, I think those two guys and the fact that you got the impression that their centers, the buildings, the environment, the people, were warm and you . . . It just sort of gravitated toward it. I mean, it helped that they were as warm as they were and not pushy. I mean, they really just sort of opened it up and it helped itself. So, that had a lot to do with it. Those became more places to socialize than even the Union building in those days. The Union building had more to offer but it was, it's big, it's cold, it's . . . It was not the same feel. It really wasn't. I mean, you almost had a home feel there. HEBERT: Were these ministers activist ministers in more areas than just integration? I know that a lot of the women's movement came out of St. Alban's and so they promoted social activism. HAMILTON: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, both those guys. Really nice men. Both progressive, in, what I would consider a progressive manner, in all sorts of social issues and it really made a difference, really made a difference. I don't know if that's as much reflection of the tenets of their faith or just that they were those kind of people, but they were open and warm people as much as the tenets of their faith. HEBERT: Did Harambe do other kinds of social activities, like go to football games together, or . . . HAMILTON: Well, yes, we did that. Initially, we were concerned that, the fraternities had this practice of sending pledges, or new members, to the games to cordon off the best seats. I don't know where the student section is now, but we used to go to about the forty yard line, which was great! Good seats. They'd have the seats between the forty and the end zone just cordoned off, and they were pretty rude about it. I mean, they'd get damn mean about it. They were their seats. So you always got pushed in to the upper end zone area, sometimes lower end zone, but still end zone. And there were some of us who like football. I like football, I like the sport and I like, and I'd been a fan. So it's, we made efforts to get better seats, get there early enough, challenge them for the seats, as well as after football game parties, and stuff like that. I mean, it was so important that you made people comfortable. It's very difficult to make it through the university environment if you don't have a cultural aspect or social aspect of it. It's just very difficult. It's not like you can go to class and go home. I mean, you're still here, so . . . A lot of these folks lived . . . I was fortunate. I didn't live on campus. A lot of people did live on, most people lived on campus who participated in the programs we were doing, and it was just the only avenue they had. It's kind of difficult for you to appreciate that now, because, I mean, you just walk all over the campus, you see black people everywhere and people on the teams. You know, in those days, I mean, there weren't any on the teams, okay! I mean, we were talking about Lora [Hinton] when we came in. I remember when we were making efforts to get them to recruit black athletes.  2  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A HEBERT: [089] How did you go about doing that? Would you petition the athletic department or try sit-ins? HAMILTON: Yes, well we met with . . . we even, we did that. In our initial sit-in in the Chancellor's office, that was one of our lists of demands that the university make an effort to recruit black athletes in all the sports. And we met with Carl Maddox and Charlie McClendon at the time, and they really had a pretty asinine attitude about it, I'll be honest with you. They weren't, I don't think, I won't say that they were blatantly racist about it. That may have been what they felt. What they said to us, they just felt like, "Well, gee, we don't," I mean, suppose, I mean, I'll never forget this, Carl Maddox said, "Well, hell, suppose the Jewish students said they wanted Jewish athletes. Do you think we ought to go out and recruit Jewish athletes?" It was like, "Yes! Damn it, if that's what it's going to take to make you win, first, and if it's what's going to take to make the university a more well-rounded environment, yes! I mean, you're not isolated, you're on a university campus. Yes." So, I mean, they just didn't really take a pretty, I thought, open attitude about it. I thought they were asinine. HEBERT: Did you all also push to get black basketball players? HAMILTON: Oh, athletes all across the board. I mean, we worked with Coach Brown when we came in. HEBERT: When did Collis Temple come in? HAMILTON: After Coach Brown came in. Maybe, gee, I don't know if it was first or second recruiting year for Coach Brown, but it was after Coach Brown. There just weren't any and there really wasn't any effort to recruit any. Of course, that was not just here, it was throughout the league, the Southeastern Conference. You know, I mean, I absolutely remember Adolph Rupp, I mean, we called, of course we called him Adolph Hitler Rupp. He never wanted black athletes at Kentucky. You know, Kentucky dominated the league. And he made the statement, I mean, it was, shit, in the papers. He made the statement that he didn't need them and wasn't going to recruit them. I remember the first black athlete there, recruited a guy named Paine. Tom Paine. Seven footer. And he eventually went to jail for some offense, rape or something, I can't remember what it was, something awful. But, there was several articles, newspaper and magazine stories about him. But I can imagine what he must have felt like on that campus and, God, I wish I could remember the magazine where the statement was made, but there was an article in the magazine where Rupp was quoted as saying, you know, he didn't need any black athletes, he didn't want any. And the only reason he had this guy was because he was a freak! So it's like, you know, that, you can't imagine the psychology of being on this campus or any campus where the only members of your race you see are in service capacities, in lower service capacities. You know, if the only, only black people you see are serving you food or cleaning up the building it's like, hey.  3  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A You want to believe that you belong. You want to believe that you have, and your people have more to contribute to this environment than those things. And I think that it is those things that contribute to those other people feeling like you don't belong. Because that's how you feel, you said, "Gee," the rest of the student body was like, "Well, what the hell do we got these people here for?" You always felt like an intruder. You just really always felt like an intruder. If you weren't, even if you weren't openly attacked, verbally or physically, you always felt like an intruder, or you were always made to feel like, "What are you doing here?" you know, "Why are you at our school? Why the devil are you making us go through having you around?" It was just an awful feeling. HEBERT: You mentioned the sit-in in the Chancellor's office. Was that 1970? Or '71? HAMILTON: Gosh, let's see. That would have been, I guess '71. HEBERT: And at the sit-in you went in with a demand, with a list of demands. HAMILTON: Oh yes. HEBERT: Was that the one with calling for black counselors and . . . HAMILTON: Counselors, teachers . . . HEBERT: Black history courses? Or was there a black history course at that time? HAMILTON: No, that was, that was part of the demand, too, curriculum changes. Yes, counselors for sure. HEBERT: Was this the sit-in where James Reddoch went in and demanded that you leave, well, the group leave and . . . HAMILTON: Yes. Yes. HEBERT: And called the police. Was that the one? HAMILTON: Yes, that was the one. I think that was '71, oh yes. It might have been spring '71. Something like that. Yes, he was such a jerk. HEBERT: How'd you feel to have a, the riot team called on you? HAMILTON: Well, first of all, you anticipated it. I mean, you went in anticipating that that was always a possibility, which is why we prepared by asking everyone not to be disruptive. To not, as far as possible, block egress, and get in the way of people doing what they would normally do in their workday, as possible. I mean, obviously you've got a bunch of people in the way, it's more difficult than it normally is.  4  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A But you wanted to be conscious of the fact that a certain amount of disorder subjects you to arrest and possible harm, physical harm. But at the same time, we felt like, part of what was the university's best defense was the ability to keep everything in-house. So, what we really wanted to do was to make it known outside of the campus, that there's a problem here. You almost hoped they were going to do it, and knowing Dean Reddoch, you were almost certain he was going to do it. I think we talked about this last time, one of the reasons was, I mean it was his job to be a jerk. I know that. I think he liked it, but I think it was his job. I think that knowing the kind of personality that Chancellor Taylor had, I mean, just a nice man, he would never make, be confrontational. He would never be confrontational. He would avoid it at whatever cost. He just wouldn't meet with us. I mean, I don't think it was that he didn't want to solve a problem or didn't recognize that, he just wouldn't want to be made to meet with you at that juncture or in that situation. HEBERT: Did he meet with you later on? HAMILTON: Yes, he did. He did. But he just didn't like that kind of confrontational approach. I mean, he's the kind of guy who would have preferred if you'd given him a call and had five or six other people give him a call and convince him, okay, meet with him. Which might have taken a month, or whatever the hell, but . . . No! You have to meet and you have to face these people. He was not that kind of person. I mean, I think, if you were forced into realizing, "Well, I got to meet with them. Okay, I'll meet with him." But he just would prefer not to do that. Dean Reddoch, no. He didn't mind. He was kind of a bad guy. And there was this, you know, you always have to have a hatchet man. HEBERT: And that was his job. HAMILTON: And that was his job. He was a pretty good hatchet man, I thought. I thought he relished it, you know? He was darn good at it. HEBERT: What about . . . was there a concern about housing and dorm rooms and dorm room assignments and . . . HAMILTON: Oh yes. HEBERT: I was speaking to Dee Williams a while back, and she said that they didn't have any kind of policy to keep black students together and white students together, and they would sometimes assign black and white students in the same rooms. HAMILTON: Right. Right. HEBERT: But then, the white student would always find an excuse to find another roommate.  5  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A HAMILTON: Right. It was interesting because, initially, initially the idea of integration was so imbedded in the students who came to this school, the black students who came to this school, that you were conscious of efforts to separate and you were conscious of defeating efforts to separate. And there really were concerns if that happened. I mean, if the luck of the draw, and the average, if the average process was the luck of the draw, you have no ability to choose your roommate, and you take whom you get, fine. You were concerned that the university encouraged, or supported, I won't even say encouraged, because you don't know that but supported efforts of people to segregate, to say, "Well, I'm not going to be in a room with a black person. Move me out." Then we worked toward stopping that. Gradually, though, the effort began movement toward, "Well, I'd rather be with somebody black." And it's really kind of a strange progression because, I think two things contribute to that. First of all, the people who were roomed with white students, and the effort was successful, became ostracized by some black students because, "Well, you're living with that white person, you think you're this way." Almost like what . . . HEBERT: What happened to you . . . HAMILTON: . . . I mentioned earlier. The other thing that happened was the more we became involved in the black power struggle as opposed to the civil rights movement because they're two . . . they're . . . one is the whole, one is a part of the whole. The more you became conscious of blackness and of the effort to promote it and the effort to promote pride and consciousness, black history, black culture. The more the drive was toward, "Well, wait a minute. Time out on this while we focus on this. Let's focus on this cultural awareness and this identity thing and this pride thing, and we'll work toward that later, toward this integration thing later. Perhaps integration isn't working as well because we aren't comfortable with ourselves. Let's become more comfortable with ourselves, and then we'll try to go back out here and do this again." And it's kind of a, a fine line. It's a dangerous thing to try, game to try to play, because, well, when are you going to be comfortable enough? Who's going to make a decision as to when you're comfortable enough? Who's going to wait around until you do it? Why should they wait around until you do it? You know, I, those are the kind of things you don't think about while you're working toward that. So, ultimately, I think, that's probably where the situation took sort of a dangerous turn, dangerous turn. HEBERT: Was this almost where the separatism became a part of it with the, not the black cultural center, but the black student union or the black student center? HAMILTON: Well, the whole thing. The whole thing because that was all happening around the same time, and I would think that that was all part and parcel of it. You know, actually, that had been happening nationally for five to seven years, I mean, we were slow. HEBERT: Right.  6  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A HAMILTON: So, we were seeing what was happening in other areas, picking up on it a little late, and during that time, you know, we were experiencing sort of a, God, what's the best word . . . I guess . . . so much frustration at what's happening here . . . God, I don't know what the best word is for this because it really involves Southern . . . disappointment that you could not as easily or readily go to the other side of town for a break. HEBERT: So you were almost, I don't . . . ostracized is a very harsh word, but when you went over to . . . HAMILTON: No, it's the exact word! HEBERT: It's the exact word? HAMILTON: That was exactly what happened. HEBERT: So there wasn't much communication between the black students here at LSU and Southern? HAMILTON: Well, I mean, obviously there's communication with the people you knew. I mean, certainly people went to school with, former classmates were there and you knew them, but as a general feeling, the Southern University . . . There were things going on at Southern University in terms of the overall black movement which impacted us so badly because the same forces that were moving toward identity and pride and culture and closeness and getting away from this integration thing were the same forces that were killing us, in terms of ourselves here, were killing us in terms of Southern because that made those people begin to say, "Well, whoa, those people are over there. They should be here. This should be the focal point of us developing a culture and developing awareness. And they should either come over here or not be a part of this struggle." So, it became difficult to socialize with the Southern University students, as much as anything else, when maybe even a year before, it was easier. You know, it happened so quickly. HEBERT: So this was in the early '70's. HAMILTON: Yes, yes. I mean, it was almost the same thing I went through in high school. It was, I mean, almost identical. It was like, "No. You don't belong to this movement or over here because you're over there at school with those white folks. We're going to consider you part of the enemy." And Harambe was making such an effort to work with them. I mean, we really were conscious of it and we were trying because we did think they were a part of this idea of pride and culture and . . . "Boy, there's a school right here and we need, you know, to bond with these guys and get them to help us." And our idea was we get them to help us, a joint effort, we can make these students appreciate more what we're talking about and where we're going and ultimately make this university recognize its responsibility more. We didn't give a damn about this university other than  7  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A the fact that they wanted theirs to be comparable to it, which is another whole story that I can't even get into because I think it's nonsense, but that's neither here nor there. HEBERT: But Harambe did make efforts to join together with Southern in certain aspects . . . HAMILTON: Oh, certainly. HEBERT: . . . at like, I remember reading about the fraternities and sororities and attempting to have joint ventures there and have them come over here and set up fraternities and sororities and that type of thing. HAMILTON: Yes. Yes. I mean, not to say that there were not some efforts that were successful because there were some that were successful, more so after the riots at Southern than before. The riots at Southern made a big thing. HEBERT: This was in 1971. HAMILTON: Yes. Because the riots were in '72-'73. But, after that it became more easy. Before that, it was very difficult for that, '71 through '73 or late '70 through '73 period. It was difficult. HEBERT: So the . . . HAMILTON: Resentment. There was very serious resentment. HEBERT: On the part of Southern students for LSU students? HAMILTON: Yes. HEBERT: Did you resent them for resenting you? HAMILTON: [314] Well, sure, you're pissed off at them, but you don't . . . I mean, we were at a disadvantage. HEBERT: There were fewer here. HAMILTON: We wanted, well, the thing was, you wanted so much to belong to some group that you almost . . . Of course, you . . . "Hey don't treat me that way!" I mean, you're angry, of course, because, damn it, "You treat me like these guys treat me. What the hell am I supposed to do?" But at the same time you really wanted them to, I mean, you really wanted them to recognize what you were going through and to, if not like you for it, respect you for it and give you your damn due. You know, give me my due. I mean, I'm over here. I mean, the struggle isn't just on the other side of town, the struggle is here! We're not running away from it; we're right here. At least recognize that. It was  8  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A kind of, I thought, stupid. It just was not very, not a very fruitful time, I thought, for us. We were just really trapped. I think that's still a problem. Not as much so, but it's still a problem. HEBERT: There's still that animosity of students . . . HAMILTON: Well, it is, there's going to be that animosity because as long as there is a Southern University, in the sense of a Southern University, that is a black school, because that's what Southern University is. I mean, as long as there is that, there is going to be conflict between black and white, between black and black, because how valid is it? More importantly, how valid is its need, is its need to the community? That's, those are very difficult questions, very difficult questions. They are going to continue to come up. In the '60s, they were real questions because it's the first time that we looked at it beyond Brown vs. the Board of Education. Brown vs. the Board of Education says separate but equal doesn't work. You can't have your . . . You can't prevent me from going to any school, going to any establishment to eat, whatever the case may be. It didn't address . . . And, beyond that, it said you have to tear the system down. It didn't address what you do with a system that was created as a segregated, as a vehicle to perpetuate segregation, but which has become so, so much a part of a culture that its people won't let it go. It didn't address that. I mean, it said, "Tear it up root and branch." Well, okay. It sounded easy when you went through elementary and secondary schools because there really wasn't a feeling of ownership as much. I mean, there was some. There was very serious resentment when these, some of these schools were torn down, or torn apart because the feeling was, "Well, why my school and not your school? Why are you going to come in here and tear my school up? This is where I've been and my family's been and . . ." But it got even worse when you're talking about a college campus because so many people had gone through it and were successful. It wasn't just a question, it wasn't just a question of it's, it's fostering segregation. It was a question of whether or not it sufficiently met its task, its goal. Its goal was to educate a certain number who were black. It did that, and those people were proud that it did that. In feeling that, they got an ownership toward it. It's a problem that's difficult to resolve now. You've got to remember, those were the first days they were talking about merging the two schools. HEBERT: In the seventies? HAMILTON: Oh yes. It was the first time they discussed the possibility of merging the two schools as a method of resolving the disparity in higher education. HEBERT: Now is this, these cases that are going before the courts right now the result of that attempt? HAMILTON: [380] Oh yes. This is when those things started. This is really when all that started. This is when those discussions became real. It's graduated to where we are now, and the answers are no less obvious, no less obvious. I know, I personally went from appreciating and recognizing a need for a Southern University and the state supporting a Southern University, as is, to where I am today where I think it's nonsense. I  9  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A just think it's nonsense. I don't disagree with those people who support the idea of historically black private colleges. I don't disagree with that, and I give money to the United Negro College Fund because the United Negro College Fund is about private schools, not state-sponsored schools, public schools. I don't think any group owns a public school. The public owns it. Period. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You know, I, the more I hear people make these arguments, the . . . A very good friend of mine, who was a professor at Southern, he and I were going through this argument, and he went through this whole thing about preserving our culture and doing this and doing that and it's our school, and I went home and, I have these books, I got him a copy of a speech given by Orville Forbush [?] to the Arkansas General Assembly, 1954, 1955, discussing the reasons he opposed integrating the University of Arkansas. Same thing. You see what I mean? It's the same thing. You know, you can't act as if this is different. It's not different, it's the same thing. You can't say, "Well, he can't say that but I can." Well, it's the same thing. But we went through that and I, it's the same problem now and the tragedy is I don't think we're any closer to resolving it, I really don't. And it's because we're talking in concepts and not practically what needs to be done, I think, but that's another whole problem. HEBERT: With the Southern riot, the riots at Southern, how did Harambe handle that? I know that there were memorial services on campus, vigils, things like that. One case in particular, it was an integrated group and Harambe left, members from Harambe left the memorial service early that evening, they didn't stay up all night, and there was a plan to march to the capital the next day. HAMILTON: Which we did. Right. HEBERT: Why leave the memorial service? Was it just to rest up for the next day or . . . HAMILTON: [431] Well, it was a couple of reasons. Actually, we were having some internal conflict at the time. That was, at the time, that it was very recently after Kent State and Jackson State. And there was this feeling that there was this great emphasis on the Kent State and the whole idea about the anti-war thing as opposed to the civil rights struggle. And there was some real friction within our ranks, and we needed to talk about it. We actually left and had a meeting because we wanted to clear some things up. And there was a feeling among some people that a march was insufficient, that, particularly a march where we were going down a path which was pretty much mapped out for us by the police and the people, because, I mean, you apply. We applied for a permit, I mean, we weren't going to go to jail. It was like, I mean, again, that was one of those things where I was in charge but there was a group of people who didn't like the way you do things, who didn't appreciate my way of doing things. You know, it's . . . it was always the difference when I was president of that organization versus the other group and one of the reasons I won versus the other group. It was always the question as to whether or not our initial and primary goal was to challenge authority and obtain our  10  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A goals in matters beyond the recognized procedure. "We're going to have a march? Who gives a damn about a permit? Let's just go do it." "Well, no. If we're going to have enough people, that people can get hurt and go to jail, we're going to get a permit, we're going to do this the right way because, hey, they have to let us do it! It's a free country. You got a right to do it. There's a procedure. Let's follow the procedure, let's do it!" That's the way I look at it. Theirs was, "No, hang the procedure. They're wrong. The whole system is wrong. I mean, once you begin adhering to one rule, you may as well follow all the rules. Damn it, let's just do it." So that's where it started, and we had these big fights about that, and . . . The march, the next day, was getting to be really rough because there were some people who, within the white group, in the anti-war group who agreed with those people . . . HEBERT: That didn't want to have . . . right HAMILTON: Gus Tabony, asshole, who was a cop. I mean, those guys, I mean we didn't even know he was a cop . . . HEBERT: Was he an instigator? HAMILTON: But I mean, he was fomenting this group. You know, he was out here like, "Oh great, yea! Hey, hey." It was like, "Hey! Whoa! You guys want to do that? I'm not going to tell you you can't, but I'm going to tell you, this group, this organization is going to do this. Now, what the hell you-all do when you get downtown is up to you, as long as you don't bring any bad faith on this group and what we're trying to do, because we applied, along with all these other people, and we're going to do it right. If there's a route, we're going to follow the devilish route." "Well, we're going to break off and people are going to follow us." "Well, then fine. Let them follow you. We're going to do this." And it was a real problem going on at that time. That's really what that was about. Not that we were upset with the idea of the vigil or . . . I mean, we had some problems. We needed to talk about. HEBERT: The way the Reveille made it sound, it was kind of, "We don't want to be here with you guys. We want to go off and do our own thing." That's how the Reveille made it sound.  11  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A HAMILTON: Well, because, as I mentioned, there were some people within those groups who were saying that. There were people within those groups at all times who did not want to either become part of a larger movement because of the fear, one, it was all white, or two, that it all of a sudden become an anti-war movement as opposed to a civil rights . . . There were always people who felt that. There was always that conflict. Yes, that conflict was one of the reasons we needed to go sit down and say, "Look, folks. Tomorrow is here. We're going to be out here marching in a couple of hours. We don't need this conflict. Let's clear it right now." HEBERT: And did that meeting work? Did you settle anything? HAMILTON: [510] Well, yes. I think it did, because I think the majority of people followed what we wanted to do and went the path we were supposed to go and accomplished what we wanted to accomplish, which was show support for those students, show that we disagreed with what the state was doing in terms of resolving those problems. That's what we wanted to do and show that we thought there were some serious civil rights issues that needed to be addressed. HEBERT: What issues were those, regarding Southern and the way the Southern system was run or the fact that the police officer shot into the crowd and killed? HAMILTON: Oh, clearly. The whole idea of resolving that conflict by putting police officers on the campus fermented that type of occurrence. I mean, I don't think there was any question that put into that environment where there was that much fear, distrust, and anarchy . . . I mean, people were running around going wild and crazy! I mean, anything could have set those people off, particularly when you're dealing with the Baton Rouge Sheriff's department, Baton Rouge City Police Department, a bunch of ignorant, racist people, okay? With guns, and more importantly, afraid, on a college campus around ten thousand black people. They're scared of them any-damn-way, I mean, and, it was just a recipe for disaster to me, on a college campus. And the idea was, you wouldn't do it here. You'd try to resolve the darn problem without having to bring guns on the campus. That was enough. The other thing was, the problems these people are talking about are real. The university does not have sufficient resources. The university is in need of money, in need of physical plants, and there was a really significant feel at that time, one of the other issues was, cultural, courses that reflected black culture. Again, you know, that was during the time when people were getting a feeling of ownership for that university. It's our school, and we can't even teach these kind of courses. Because the courses, the curriculum requirements were so rigidly controlled by the state and the state board and everything. And, you know, there were some things done wrong on the students' side, greatly, I mean, because I knew the guys who were leading this thing. They were not as wellorganized as they should have been. Their planning was poor, and their goals were not  12  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A well-defined. I mean, they were defined broadly, and I think they were able to, in defining them so broadly, generate as much support as they did. But, you know, one of the responsibilities of leadership is, okay, let's define it more clearly toward accomplishing something. They hadn't gotten to that level yet, they just hadn't. Hell, they were students, you know, young students. And . . . HEBERT: Were they students from Baton Rouge? Were they originally . . . HAMILTON: A combination of students from Baton Rouge and other, I mean, Charlene Horton was from Baton Rouge. Fred Prejean was from Lafayette. God, I've forgotten that little guy, the guy who was the main spokesperson. He was from Monroe? HEBERT: And who was he? Do you remember his name? HAMILTON: [579] I can't remember his name. I really can't. I have to ask my wife. She was at Southern at the time. But . . . it was still part, it was something we identified with because it was . . . We'd had, we'd had a march asking for the same things, some of the same things. So we recognized that what they were talking about was part and parcel of our struggle, and there were a sufficient number of white students who recognized that it was part and part of their struggle. It was a great opportunity to get everybody working for the same end, to get the march together and have everybody in support of that. You know, that, to me, was as important as them making a statement that we were going to be as radical as Berkeley or wherever the devil else they were going to . . . because we weren't. You know, come on . . . HEBERT: You're in Louisiana. HAMILTON: "You're not in Berkeley! You're in Baton Rouge! So come on, let's act like we're in Baton Rouge and do it the right way and accomplish what we're going to accomplish because if we do this properly, and we follow the darn permitted route that we're supposed to go on, it's going to be effective." "But no, the TV will catch us more if we go this way and we don't do what we're told to do and they can't stop us if there's . . ." "Well, yes, they can," but that was just ridiculous. HEBERT: Were these people PSA people, people with the Progressive Students Alliance, Ted Schirmer and that group, a lot of them? HAMILTON: Ted was part of that, too. Yes, Ted was wild. He was wild. Ted wanted to go the other way, too. I think, eventually, Ted did. Ted and Gus, and a whole bunch of  13  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A wild ass people. It was crazy. It was really crazy. I just don't think those people thought. I think they . . . You know, you wild, it's the spur of the moment, and you believe that this is the moment to capture, and the way to capture it is the more dramatic way than this other way. And I just never agreed with that. HEBERT: But you did get TV coverage and press coverage on the march from here to there? Without having a riot and getting arrested. HAMILTON: Sure. No, no. I mean, you were going to get that. The whole idea that there were going to be fifty to a hundred to two hundred people out marching about something you're going to get, especially during that time, you were going to get coverage. I mean, just make your statement and make it clearly and try to get it across to where people understand that you're sincere and honest about it. You know, you don't have to blow up the damn building. Just walk down there and make our statement. HEBERT: Did you meet with the governor or any people like that once you got to the state capitol, or . . . HAMILTON: He didn't come out. We asked that he come out, but he didn't come out. There were some . . . HEBERT: Was it Governor McKeithen then? HAMILTON: It was Edwards. HEBERT: It was Edwards. His first term? HAMILTON: It was Edwards' first term. Yes, because right after that . . . Well, I was on the darn Governor's Blue Ribbon Commission to review all that stuff. The Governor's Press Secretary, Dale, God, I've forgotten what Dale's last name was. Well, he was, took a class with me here, and he recommended that I be appointed to one of those, that Blue Ribbon Committee thing, to look at, review it, what had occurred and the whole problem of resolving these, these issues at Southern. But it was Edwards. HEBERT: Was that the committee that the Attorney General set up? HAMILTON: The Governor appointed this. HEBERT: The Governor appointed this committee. Because the Attorney General did have a committee looking into the riots and such. HAMILTON: But the Governor said that. The Governor had set that. HEBERT: What about the Black Muslims and the shootings downtown of the Black Muslims? Did Harambe take any action in that?  14  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side A HAMILTON: No. We did not. We did not take any official action in it at all. We were not . . . I can't say we weren't, well, I can say that, we were not supportive, as a group, of the Muslims. I mean, obviously, there were some people who were sympathetic to them. The Muslims as a group in Baton Rouge never really caught hold here . . . [End Tape 471, Side A. Begin Tape 471, Side B.] HEBERT: [020] So it never caught, it didn't catch hold here? This was late, this was in the seventies. A lot later than it happened in the rest of the country. HAMILTON: Right. Right. And the Muslims just were never a group that caught on really big here. Particularly in those days when there was still conflict among them, I mean, within the Muslims, as to the direction they were going to go in: the Elijah Mohammed group, the Malcolm X group, you know how it is, a whole bunch of stuff was going on at that time and it just never caught on. It just . . . I think their rhetoric was too abrasive, abusive, it just never worked well here. It's difficult in the South, I think, to use that kind of rhetoric and to talk about devils and the whole idea of this harsh separatism when everybody lives so closely around each other. You know, I mean, racism in the South is so different than it is in the Northeast. That's really more of a Northeast or even the West Coast but certainly the Northeast. It's more amenable to that, I think, than it was, certainly then, because the Muslims are doing much better now, but their rhetoric is softer now, than they were then. HEBERT: But Harambe did take, did community work, community service work. I'm thinking of the tutoring program. HAMILTON: Yes, we did. HEBERT: How did that work? How was that set up and how did it work? HAMILTON: Well, actually, we started working it through the churches. It was a principle communication source, identifying within the churches, the ministers and their youth programs and offering students who would volunteer as tutors for children within the schools, minority students who were either going, principally, for those who were going to integrated schools, majority race schools, tutorials and basics courses, and then we did Big Buddy. Actually, it was Big Brother, stuff like that,  15														Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections, LOUISiana Digital Library, Baton Rouge, La.

Transcript Hamilton 471B										Narrator: Leo Hamilton 4700.0322 Interviewer: Mary Hebert Session II Transcriber: Robin Cate 11 September 1993 Leo Hamilton 4700.0322 Tape 471 Side B which were good programs. We didn't get, actually, we didn't get enough support for that. We should have concentrated much more so on that. HEBERT: Well, the university didn't really support that action . . . HAMILTON: No, they didn't. HEBERT: Didn't Chancellor Taylor pull some funding away from the tutoring program? I think it was some funding that the SGA gave to the tutoring program, that the Chancellor pulled out so that it couldn't be given to . . . HAMILTON: Yes. He, I don't, the thing is, I'm not sure, first, they understood what the program was about. Plus, I'm trying to remember when that was . . . HEBERT: This was 1972. I didn't write down a month. It was '72. HAMILTON: [054] They didn't really understand what the program was about. The whole thing about the controls, they didn't think there were sufficient controls on disbursement procedures and . . . We weren't as organized . . . Again, you know, I mean, technically, the mechanics, mechanically organized as we could have or should have been. That's one of those examples of their not taking the time to say, "This is a good idea. Let's show you how to do it." Rather than, "Well, you guys are doing that wrong, take the money." You know, that's sort of . . . It was all dis-communications, as much as anything else, and I think the university did us a disservice on that, even though I think we probably could have handled it a little better ourselves, too, but, they did us a disservice because they were in a better position to offer assistance than they did. HEBERT: How did these tutoring programs work? Did the kids come to places on campus or did you, did people go out to the churches to tutor them? HAMILTON: Actually, we did more going out than their coming in. We didn't have a place at the time. I mean, it wasn't like we had a, I mean . . . On a couple of occasions we'd have kids come over, really with, like, Big Brother, to the centers and sit at the  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  centers where there are some study-type areas, but, usually, we'd go to the church, and do it there. HEBERT: Do you think this role-model kind of thing's important for kids? HAMILTON: Oh, yes. HEBERT: Someone in college being a role-model. HAMILTON: Certainly. Can I have some water? HEBERT: There's a fountain [pause in tape]. . . Another community action type of a thing I noticed that Harambe did was to go in to some of the bars around campus and to desegregate them . . . HAMILTON: [077] Oh yes, that was hilarious. One of the things we were concerned about was that you could not drink or eat immediately around the campus, that they were subtly discriminating. Some overtly, but some subtly, against the students. So, I mean, white students could just go anywhere they want, but there were several places that just would not serve blacks, particularly the bars. And we did this, along with the Reveille, we were going to do a survey, and, let's see, me, Kerry Pourciau, who else was with us that night? Harold Deselle and Romel Wren were going to, and the Reveille reporters were going to follow us. Gosh, it was awful. We did several. I can't remember all of them, but I remember . . . HEBERT: The Cotton Club . . . HAMILTON: I remember the Cotton Club and the Pastime distinctly. The Cotton Club because I grew up right down the street from the Cotton Club, over on West Johnson, and I knew those people, Frankie and . . . God, I've forgotten his brother's name. I mean, I grew up around them. They knew my family, the whole thing. And I knew they discriminated. There wasn't any question about it. We went in there, and we sat the bar and they came in and sat over toward the side. We asked for a beer. Frankie looked at me and said, "I know you." "Yes, yes. I live right down the street over there." He said, "Yes, you're Hamilton. What are you doing here?" "I just want a beer. We just want to get a beer." He said, "You know you can't get a beer here." I said, "Well, what do you mean I can't get a beer? Sure I can get a beer."  2  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  He said, "You know that you have to go back there to get a beer." Because you'd have to go . . . There was this . . . You couldn't eat or drink there, but you could go to the liquor store, which was on the back, and buy beer. I said, "Well, no, we just want to sit in here and get a beer." And it just kind of went on and then he said, "I can't believe you're here." Then, it dawned on him because the camera guy got up and took a picture. It dawned on him what was going on. He said, "I can't believe you're doing this to me, Hamilton. You've lived here all your life. I mean, why would you create these problems?" I said, "Look, Frankie, I'm not trying to create any problems. The problem is you're creating problems. You're wrong. You can't discriminate." We went round and round and round and round, and he was getting upset. His brother was a real ass, was getting, and he came over and was really being obnoxious. And I think one of the guys from the law school was there. I can't remember who it was. But his brother had called the police to come throw us out. We hadn't done anything, and we were going to sit there, just . . . So the police came in and we went round and round and round and round and ultimately the police said, "Well, you know you, the man, it's his private property. He wants you to leave." I was like, "Hey! We're going to leave but you can't throw us out." Then we got in this big row with the police about, "Well, we can throw you out." I was like, "Wait, wait. Let's go." So we eventually left. The other place we had a real rough time was the Pastime . . . HEBERT: Is that the place out on Nicholson? HAMILTON: Yes. It's on the corner of Nicholson and South. We stepped in, and it's kind of, almost like the Pastime. Big Tiger place. Big, big Tiger football fans. We went in there, and it's kind of dark, pinball machines and stuff. We sat down, and the same type thing. The guy gets in the corner. I ordered a beer. Except it's a different kind of crowd in there at night, now. Kind of more rustic crowd. HEBERT: It's not the football crowd.  3  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HAMILTON: No, no, no, no, no. Certainly not the LSU crowd. I mean, it's still an LSU crowd, but not the university staff type, I mean, more of a Baton Rouge type. They were like, "No." And guy said, no, Harold asked for a beer, and the guy just looked at him and he said, "No." So he turned around and walked away. I said, "Maybe you didn't hear him. We just want a beer." He said, "You must not be from here, huh?" "Yes, I live right down Nicholson Drive right there." "I said, you must not be from here." I was like, "No. I am from here. But, you know, you can't not get me a beer." By this time, there was another guy coming from the other end of the bar, and this guy was about to come across the bar. And the Reveille guy took his picture, and they blew up. I mean, they absolutely blew up and just ranted and raved and were calling the police, and . . . we had to leave out of there. Two or three other places we tried but they weren't as . . . Eventually, well, there might have been one that gave us a beer, but the others just said no. You know, just, "No. We don't serve you." HEBERT: Was there any desire on your part to file suit against these places for not serving you? HAMILTON: Sure. We were going to do it. HEBERT: Did it happen? HAMILTON: [143] No, actually it didn't happen because we wound up working with Ben Shieber at the law school and one other professor over there to . . . and after the article came out, the Morning Advocate came out and did a survey, too, and eventually convinced them, "Hey, you-all are going to lose this lawsuit. If these people file suit against you, you better serve them. You got to change your policy. If you serve food, if you do all the other things, I'm sorry, you got to serve them!" There were several, Shieber particularly, but several members of the law school, who helped us go back and meet with those people and convinced them that their policies were wrong. If someone came in and asked, they were going to have to serve them. We went back on a couple of times, and they served us.  4  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HEBERT: So there was no problem after that. HAMILTON: No. I mean, and a couple of them, even after we talked with them, they explained, "Look, I mean, even if I don't have anything against you . . . " blah, blah, blah, I mean, that's a damn lie. Of course, you don't want me in your bar. "My business is going to go off . . ." Hey! I'm sorry. I mean, the bottom line is, nobody is going to run in here to hang out with a bunch of people who don't want them in here anyway. HEBERT: Right. HAMILTON: "I mean, I'm not going to come in here every damn night. I just want to know that if I came in here I'm going to be treated properly." And, I think once everybody kind of got that across and got the rough edges out of the way, it worked out. HEBERT: You never had any desire to try to integrate the places west of the, on the west side of the river? HAMILTON: Oh, hell no! You'd get killed! HEBERT: No, I just heard Kerry Pourciau tell a story about how he went to one of those places one night. HAMILTON: Yes, he's been over there. No! No! No, no, no, no, no. Never wanted to do that! You could get hurt, obviously. The police department in Baton Rouge, the fact that these establishments that we were dealing with were closely aligned with the university, that there were people who were frequent patrons from the university, hell no, they weren't going to do that. I mean they might have gotten a bit, like the guy who was about to come over the table, he might have been an asshole for whatever, but . . . HEBERT: But you didn't think you were going to get beaten up or anything in those places . . . HAMILTON: But we didn't think that we'd get mobbed. I mean, you might have one or two people who might come across, and you'd have to deal with them. But . . . we knew the Reveille was right there, once the camera began to roll, these guys were not going to do anything. They were going to be mad, but they were going to recognize that that's the press, and they weren't going to want to be on the front page of the paper beating up a bunch of students over something like that. In Port Allen, or one of those other places over there, it'd never be in the newspaper. The camera would be smashed, and we'd be in the hospital. HEBERT: If not dead. HAMILTON: If not dead! So, no! I was, like, "I'm not going to do that. I'm not stupid!"  5  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HEBERT: How did the Baton Rouge Police Department treat black students, or black people in general in Baton Rouge? HAMILTON: Oh, awful! Absolutely awful! No question about it. The Baton Rouge Police Department was awful, racist. There were no blacks on the police department. I mean, I can remember when the first guy came on the force, which would have been, '67, '68, one or two. Other than that, there were no blacks on the police department. They were very, very . . . I mean, hey, you . . . They were mean! Shucks, they'd hit you over the head or whatever the devil, and, no, you didn't want to deal with police. HEBERT: What about campus security? How did they treat black students on campus? I've read some cases where they would harass black men walking on campus at night. HAMILTON: Yes. They would harass you. I mean, "What are you doing out walking around on the campus? First of all, you're not supposed to be out here walking around." HEBERT: Even if you were a student. HAMILTON: "How do I know you're a student?" I mean, once you, you had to prove you were, and even after you proved that you were, you had to go through the hassle of them berating you or really just harassing you because you were out and about. Because, I mean, it was, and I mean, this is . . . I think, a reflection as much of the caliber of people who were on the force. I look at Campus Police in those days as being generally a place to hide for a guy who couldn't be on the Sheriff's Department, the Baton Rouge Police Department, or any other legitimate law enforcement thing. But he wanted to have a uniform and a gun, if possible. They really just weren't very good, and there was a lot of racism. HEBERT: What about the Ganch and Rando case. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly. It's the, two black people who were on the Parade Grounds and one was, they were charged with indecent exposure or something like that. HAMILTON: I really don't remember. HEBERT: And arrested. There was a big protest about their arrest. HAMILTON: I really don't remember it. HEBERT: This was in the, in '72 or so. HAMILTON: I really don't remember it. I really don't. I hate getting up. Let me, I should get a glass of water. [pause in tape] HEBERT: What other kinds of community type work did Harambe do? With this was past, this was after the voter registration.  6  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HAMILTON: [214] We did do some voter registration though. We did those types of things, but mostly, really, what we were concerned about were education type issues, children. Focusing on, like the Big Brother type programs. Getting young black kids off the streets and focused toward black pride and that whole awareness thing. We worked with the NAACP on some voter registration projects. We didn't, we tried to steer clear of partisan politics other than working with the whole idea of getting more blacks elected to office. HEBERT: So you'd support black candidates if they were running for office? Or . . . HAMILTON: Sometimes. Sometimes. But, I mean, we would not get in-, I mean we didn't want to get involved in picking candidates over, one over the other. We wanted to get involved in getting black people running and getting black people elected, but we wouldn't want to say we're going to support Joe Blow over the other guy. We didn't want to do that. It just, it's a bad way to do it. You just get, you lose control over it, first of all, and you make those decisions on issues that may or may not be supportable. It's just a real problem to do that, so we tried not to do that. HEBERT: Let's talk about campus again. What about David Duke on campus? What was he like? We talked a little about him last time . . . HAMILTON: He was a real jerk. But, I mean . . . HEBERT: Did you ever listen to him at Free Speech Alley and participate in that? HAMILTON: Discussions and arguments and . . . HEBERT: When he was there. HAMILTON: [241] I didn't. Certainly other people did. But, I didn't. I believed then, and I believe now, that you're not going to change him. There are those people who are going to agree with him, and there's not much you're going to do about them other than prove they're wrong and just be who you are. I never thought he was very effective. I mean, if I thought he was effective, I probably would have done more. I just never thought he was very effective. The times were against him, we felt. So he was not . . . In fact, he's much more effective today than he was then. Much more so. People laughed at him. I mean, he was a jerk and he ran around saying things that were offensive but . . . HEBERT: His following wasn't very large. HAMILTON: But his following wasn't very big, so you never felt he was a major concern. HEBERT: You were still here when Kerry Pourciau ran for SGA President.  7  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HAMILTON: Oh, for sure. HEBERT: Did Harambe support him and push for his election? HAMILTON: Yes, yes. HEBERT: Was, did you believe that he could win the election or was it just, we're going to run, Kerry's going to run and . . . HAMILTON: [260] Well, actually, the, I believed he could win, clearly. I thought he could win because the timing was right and because Kerry had aligned himself with a number of, a sufficient number of organizations. We knew it would be tough. Actually, his most difficult group to get support from was Harambe. Again, because during that period the group was going through that transition where he was viewed as being more white than black or not in support of the black agenda, the black pride agenda. He was more of an integrationist when the movement was pushing toward this cultural identity separatist thing, beginnings. There were some people who were younger, I mean, we were in our, what, senior, junior/senior class, and you're talking about the freshman/sophomore classes of blacks who would prefer to just not vote for him at all. So really we had a hard time. We supported him, and we worked our tails off to get black people to not be apathetic and to, one, realize he could win, and two, it's not enough to say that he doesn't agree with you. It's just not enough. So, yes, we worked for him and supported him. He was a friend; he's still a friend. HEBERT: Who were some of the white students or professors that were opposed to having black students on campus? Were there any leaders that were just completely opposed to having black students on campus and treated . . . HAMILTON: [285] I don't think there was any university official who ever officially took a position that they didn't want black students on campus and worked toward getting them off. Not during my tenure. Not that I met or anything like that. There were people who you felt uncomfortable around and who you thought preferred you . . . I mean, I thought Dean Reddoch could give a damn about black people being on campus. But, I don't think there was ever an effort by him or anyone else to ensure that there would be no black people on campus, or that they failed. You know, I don't think that. HEBERT: So you never had a professor that you felt was . . . HAMILTON: Oh, not like in, not like in high school. No. Not like in high school. I had professors who I felt . . . I felt, through what they did and how they acted, believed I could never make it. Believed I probably couldn't compete and shouldn't be allowed to compete, but they didn't do anything that openly . . . I don't think there was anyone who was unprofessional enough to not do his job.  8  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  I think that what we experienced and what I had people discuss with me, more than anything else, was the unwillingness to help or the or the or the belief that this person would do something more for a white student than they'd do for a black student. But I don't think anyone had an example of a teacher who was unprofessional enough at the college level to openly discriminate against them. I really don't think that occurred. It didn't occur to me. It did not occur to me. HEBERT: Who was your favorite teacher while you were here? Did you have one professor that stood out above the others? HAMILTON: I had a couple of them that I really liked. Jim Bowlner was really one of my favorite professors. HEBERT: Why was that? HAMILTON: [315] Political Science? Because I thought he was a good professor and he was he was entertaining. He was very, very good, and very entertaining. Dr. Timmons, I never had him as a teacher, but I was on a number of committees and things with him, and I just thought he was one of the finest people I ever worked around. Oh gosh, Dr. Eubanks . . . HEBERT: Did Harambe have a faculty advisor type person? Did you have to have an alignment with a faculty member? Or . . . HAMILTON: Well, there weren't any black faculty members. HEBERT: So there was no . . . HAMILTON: So, no. HEBERT: No sponsor or that kind of thing? HAMILTON: No. Not at all. There was no faculty member. No one wanted to adopt us. Now we were assigned to work with, after we had all those meetings with the chancellor's office, we were eventually assigned to work with Don Tarver on a number of things. But we never had a faculty advisor in those days because who wanted to be the faculty advisor for Harambe? You know, there wasn't any black faculty, so no! HEBERT: Did you-all get a black history course or any of those things that you asked for? HAMILTON: Eventually. God, I can't remember the man's name. Yes, we did, before I left the campus. There were two courses and I cannot remember the professor's name. I really can't. Gosh.  9  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HEBERT: Did Harambe become the Black Action Movement later on? Did it die out? HAMILTON: [341] It died out, I know that. But, you know, after I got to law school, I wasn't as active in it. I don't know what . . . In fact, I wasn't active at all after I went to law school. I didn't have time for it. So I really don't know what happened. And like most things, I'm sure it died out as much because of leadership changes as much as the fact that the need changed and other organizations developed. The idea that there were black fraternities and sororities. You know, all those things made a difference. HEBERT: Do you think changing attitudes, societal, society's attitudes, also, contributed to that where black students were more accepted on campus as time went on? HAMILTON: I'd like to think that. Although I work now with, I have worked with Leadership LSU for three of the last four years, where the black students really talk about the same problems we talked about. Very much so. Still . . . I was surprised. HEBERT: Well, I know, I walk down through the quad sometimes at lunch time and the groups aren't integrated; there are groups of black kids together and groups of white kids together and there's never any mingling. HAMILTON: Yes, I was really surprised. HEBERT: That surprises me, too. HAMILTON: [360] Yes, I was absolutely surprised at the things people were telling me they were concerned about or the racism that they saw. In fact, it sounded worse. It sounded worse. It sounded as if it were more subtle and alarming to me, really. It was much more alarming because at least when I was in school, even though I thought it was blatant in a number of ways, for some people, I didn't ever have the feeling, I didn't ever have the feeling that the majority wanted it to be that way. You had the feeling that the majority were merely indifferent and were going to allow these other people to do things to you. You never had the feeling that the majority were against you. They just didn't give a damn about you, and wished you weren't there so these other people can be jerks. You get, in talking to these people, you get the impression that the group of jerks is bigger than it was then. I mean, really, it's, amazingly as that sounds, what we were upset about was, as much as anything else, never feeling a part of it. People never let you feel a part of it. That meant the people who openly hated you or the people who didn't. They just wished you weren't there. Here, when I talk to these people, it's like there's a real hate, or a real dislike. It was interesting to me. It was disappointing, but it was really interesting to me that that's the way it was.  10  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HEBERT: Have you kept active with the Alumni Association and those kinds of things? HAMILTON: Yes. HEBERT: Are you part of the Tureaud chapter? HAMILTON: Oh yes, I was president one year. HEBERT: Oh really. Now after you got your bachelor's degree from LSU, you went on to law school here. Was there any thought of you going to somewhere else, another law school, or did you want to go to LSU Law School? HAMILTON: I wanted to go to school here. I'm, sorry, I'm a Tiger fan. HEBERT: You're a Tiger fan. HAMILTON: [401] I like it. I wanted to stay in Louisiana, and I thought the best place to practice, to go to law school if you're going to stay in the state is LSU. HEBERT: What was law school like? HAMILTON: Awful. I liked college until law school. HEBERT: Well, it's kind of like graduate school, I think it's just constant work. HAMILTON: It's awful. HEBERT: Do you think getting a degree from LSU has helped you, in your career? HAMILTON: Yes. Sure. I really do. I mean, I don't think that it can be dismissed that if you're in the state, and you're going to be successful in the state that you have some connexity with this university. I believe that. I think that's a contributing factor. I mean, not that you can't be, but it certainly helps. HEBERT: So, I read somewhere that during the '80s you were the assistant secretary to the La. Department of Labor? HAMILTON: Yes. HEBERT: Who did you work for in that capacity? HAMILTON: Phyllis Mouton was the secretary, Roemer was the governor. HEBERT: How did you get that position? Was it appointed?  11  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HAMILTON: Yes. I know enough people and worked for the State Legislature for a number of years and worked for a labor organization, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees for five and a half years, and concentrated on labor law, that's my area. HEBERT: Did you always work for the firm that you work for now? HAMILTON: Three years. HEBERT: Okay. So did you start out with a firm or did you start out on your own? HAMILTON: [428] Actually I started out with the state. Started with the State Senate. Then . . . No, actually I started with AFSCME, I started with them, then went to the State Senate, practiced with a smaller firm, Blache, Perkins, and Koch, K-O-C- H, and then moved to Breazeale, Sachse, and Wilson. HEBERT: Did you feel you were a path breaker, or you were breaking new ground, going out and working as a black attorney in this city or . . . HAMILTON: God, I never felt that way. I mean, people tell you that. I never felt that way. I, and I don't think that there are only a couple, well, I can't say I don't think, there were a couple of times that I did something with the intent of . . . not necessarily being the first black but being, having black people involved in something. There were a couple of times I did something with that in mind, that black people should be involved in this area, and damn it, I'm going to do it. HEBERT: Such as? HAMILTON: The labor movement. When I worked for AFSCME, I mean, I was always interested. My dad was a labor union member and I was interested in the labor movement, but I was always concerned that the labor movement is, and was then, and to a certain degree now, very racist, and very concerned with wanting to get in the labor movement and move black people to the front, to the forefront. That's why I went to work with AFSCME. HEBERT: How is that, A-S . . . HAMILTON: A-F-S-C-M-E. The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. It's one of the largest labor unions in the country. I liked the idea that it was public sector, that it was basically white and blue collar, not just the blue collar. It's much more difficult at the blue collar level. And I liked the history of that union, from what I had read. The history of the union was really interesting. In Louisiana, there had been significant efforts to integrate the public sector. Suits had to be filed, and what I had learned about that union was that as that union became, as the public sector became more integrated, and the union became more integrated, it became less representative. That is, it became less responsive to those people. And I wanted to be a part of making it more  12  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  responsive, and I recognized that the labor movement was a significant part of the politics of the state at the time, particularly the Democratic Party. I really felt like, "Hey, we were not, as a race, taking advantage of that and not making the labor movement become more responsive." I wanted to do something about it. So that was a conscious effort. In moving from the Department of Labor to the practice with Blache, Perkins, and Koch, we were making a conscious effort to have an integrated law firm. We had Johnny Koch, who was a very good friend. Well, he was a very good friend of all of ours, and Johnny and I have been friends for years. We went to school together. But C. J. Blache is from New Orleans, Tom Perkins from New Orleans, but both had gone to college out-of-state. Tommy had gone to Harvard. Blache, C. J. had gone to LeMoyne, and we were conscious . . . So we had all gone to integrated colleges and universities. We were conscious of wanting to integrate. And they'd gone to Loyola Law School, so we'd all gone to . . . in integrated environments. We were conscious of the problems in the legal profession and the real segregation within the legal profession and the result, the resulting loss of opportunity for minority attorneys. We knew Johnny and Johnny . . . We had worked together on some things, it was like, "Hey! Let's have an integrated law firm." And we did. So we integrated a law firm. We not only were integrated but we were going to use the integrated environment to work in different areas because, principally, black attorneys were, or still are, either criminal lawyers or plaintiff's attorneys, personal injury, plaintiff's attorneys. None of us liked that. I mean, first of all, none of us wanted to do either of those things. None of us wanted to be criminal lawyers and none of us wanted to do plaintiff, personal injury work. C. J. really, is a lobbyist. Tommy likes defense work and commercial regulations. You know, I like labor work. You know, Johnny likes lobbying and commercial regulations. So, it was an opportunity to have a firm which was integrated that would move into other areas. We were, I think, successful for a short period of time. We wanted to take the next step, which was moving into a larger firm, and integrating a larger firm in Baton Rouge. Breazeale, Sachse, and Wilson is the oldest firm in town, sixty years old. They were prepared to make that move, too. The new leadership of that firm, the managing partners, wanted to move into integrating the legal profession, as well as wanting to move into several areas of the law that we had expertise in. "It was like, okay." And it worked well. It worked where the personalities were such that we were, we have been able to make it work so far, so we joined that firm. HEBERT: So the two combined. Or you, your firm combined with . . . HAMILTON: Yes. Right. Well, I mean . . . HEBERT: Or joined . . . HAMILTON: They bought us out is what they did!  13  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HEBERT: They bought us out. HAMILTON: I mean, a merger of sorts, but, yes. So it works, it worked in that sense, yes. But, when you talk about path- . . . I mean, other than doing that . . . HEBERT: And that was a conscious effort, too. HAMILTON: [555] Yes, yes. I guess, maybe even going to LSU. But, I mean, I went to, I was a, I went to Lee High School because my parents made me do it. I went to LSU as much because I grew up in the shadow of the school as much as because I wanted to go integrate the school. I mean, that was on my mind, sure. But . . . HEBERT: And when you went to law school, that, it was just you wanted to go to LSU Law School or was it . . . HAMILTON: I wanted to go to LSU Law School, and I wanted to go to an integrated law school. And . . . HEBERT: And the law school had been integrated for thirty years by that time. HAMILTON: It had been integrated, yes, no matter how slight that may have been. HEBERT: How many other black students were in law school at the time you were there? HAMILTON: There were . . . four? Maybe five. HEBERT: Was it the same kind of . . . HAMILTON: Tyson, Pattan, David, David Prejean. God, I've forgotten the other guy's name. Billy . . ., [and] Cannon. Seven. Because there was one other person I can't think of the name. Seven of them in the whole school. There were eight in my class and of my class, three of us, maybe . . . HEBERT: Was it the same kind of camaraderie between the black law students as there had been among . . . HAMILTON: Yes. HEBERT: Did you feel more accepted in law school? HAMILTON: No. HEBERT: No. It was the same kind of feeling that you had?  14  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HAMILTON: Yes. Exactly. Maybe more so. Maybe more so. Yes, I think more so. But, certainly, no feeling of acceptance. Not at all. So it was the same game. HEBERT: Are there any law school professors that stand out in your mind as being outstanding or . . . HAMILTON: [598] I suppose, my most, the law school professor I liked the most would be Ben Shieber. I liked him personally. I liked, he's in an area of the law that I like, so, it helped. HEBERT: You had contact with him before going to law school. HAMILTON: Yes, and I knew him before going to law school. In terms of people who I thought were just excellent teachers? Oh, several excellent, excellent teachers. People I liked, Paul Beyer [?] I like. But I think Austin Johnson, I think, even though I think he has a personality problem, but I think he's, clearly, a brilliant man. Mr. Litvinoff, Dr., Professor Litvinoff. Gosh, I, you know, you can't think of all the names. Pugh, who I really enjoyed. He was a delightful man, as well as a good professor. Mr. Pascal, Robert Pascal, Professor Pascal, who I thought was a brilliant person but a real weird guy. HEBERT: I had a friend who had him . . . HAMILTON: My very first day in law school I had, my very first day, very first class, Professor Pascal, and he's quite a character. Quite a character. But I thought he was a brilliant man. And, clearly, thought that he was a professional, that it didn't matter whether you were black, white, or green, you know, he was going to handle you the same way. No question about it. I didn't get the impression that there were, any of my teachers that treated me differently because I was black. HEBERT: It was more the students who were the ones who kept the distance. HAMILTON: Right. Yes. Right. Much, much more so the students. But I never had the impression that any of my professors, and that's not to say they were or they weren't, I don't know. That's the good thing. I thought they were professional. And I thought they did their jobs as well as they could. HEBERT: Is there anything that you wish LSU would have given to you that it didn't? That, as a whole, during your whole career here, that it didn't? HAMILTON: Gosh, that's hard to say. Because . . . I mean, when you say, "That LSU had given you," I suspect you mean the LSU experience. HEBERT: The LSU experience, that's exactly what I mean. HAMILTON: And the LSU experience, it gave me a great deal.  15  Hamilton, Leo - Tape 471, Side B  HEBERT: That was my next question. HAMILTON: I mean . . . It gave me a great deal of frustration, but, at the same time, it gave me a great deal, feeling of accomplishment. Disappointment, but, at the same time I had a marvelous time. HEBERT: I have to . . .  16														Special Delivery: A Showcase of LSU Libraries Special Collections, LOUISiana Digital Library, Baton Rouge, La.

Begin Tape 472, Side A.] HEBERT: Okay. So you had a marvelous time at LSU? HAMILTON: I mean, I had a marvelous time, despite the problems. HEBERT: Well, last time you mentioned that it wasn't all bad, and . . . HAMILTON: Well, it wasn't. I mean, I had a marvelous time. I mean, clearly, I had some bad times, but I met some interesting and wonderful people. People who are my friends today. I learned a great deal about life and about myself, which I think the college experience is supposed to give you. I mean, I'm more concerned that the university, from where I sit today, has not progressed far enough beyond where it was then, than I am that I did not get enough from the university experience. I got a significant amount from it and, I mean, I'd do it again. No question about it. HEBERT: Well, that's about all I had to cover. Is there anything that I've left out that you'd like to talk about? Have I left out anything about your LSU experience, or . . . HAMILTON: No. HEBERT: Okay. HAMILTON: No. [End Tape 472, Side A.
