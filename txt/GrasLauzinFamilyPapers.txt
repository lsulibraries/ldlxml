Letter from Francis Palm to Henrietta Lauzin, 1861, Dec. 29	Palms, Francis F., 1837-1904.	1861-12-29	1861	letter (10p.)	Francis Palms, Camp Lovell, writes to Henrietta Lauzin, Baton Rouge, inquiring about current events and providing news from his current encampment.  He begins by commenting on Henrietta's involvement in a recent production staged by the Sewing Society, stating 'I am curious to know how my little timid friend Henrietta appeared on the stage'. Following this, he provides details of their Christmas celebration in camp, stating that they 'had a grand camp dinner'.  Shortly after Christmas, Palms writes that he was assigned to a search party for a soldier, Henry Walsh, who was shot by an 'Irishman' upon entering the man's house.  Although Walsh was recovered, Palms relays that he will probably die slowly from his wounds.  Later in the letter, Palms asks 'How many thought of the poor soldier as they chatted merrily around their Christmas fireside?'.  However, he then states 'But why these sad thoughts! We must weather the storm and I might as well brave my heart...'	Francis Palms enlisted as a private within the Confederate Army on May 23, 1861 at Camp Moore, Louisiana.  He was assigned to Co. F, known as the Delta Rifles, which was part of the 4th Louisiana Infantry. Henrietta Lauzin (b.1842) was the daughter of Dr. Jean Lauzin and Leocadie Teetzman and the great-great-granddaughter of Antonio de Gras.	en	text	Palms, Francis F., 1837-1904.; Lauzin, Henrietta, b. 1842.; Louisiana--History--Civil War, 1861-1865.

Letter from Francis Palms to Henrietta Lauzin, 1862 Jan. 22	Palms, Francis F., 1837-1904.	1862-01-22	1862	letter (8p.)	Francis Palms, Camp Lovell, writes to Henrietta Lauzin, Baton Rouge, regarding his experiences at camp.  He comments on a recent visit from a mutual friend, Mrs. F.C.C., and explains that he chose yellow stationary for her letter 'because I knew it would please you and I would do anything reasonable to please a good friend, such as you have ever proved yourself to be'.  He states that they will receive a furlough of sixty days beginning in March and remarks they are being offered '$50 if we re-enlist'. He then laments the boredom  and rigors of camp life, describing forced marches through knee-high mud and rain.	Francis Palms (1837-1904) enlisted as a private in the Confederate Army on May 23, 1861, at Camp Moore, Louisiana.  He was assigned to Co. F of the Delta Rifles, which was part of the 4th Louisiana Infantry.  Following the war, he returned to his birthplace of  Detroit, Michigan, where he helped to manage his father's many interests.   Mr. Palms was married three times, and, with his second wife, Miss C.F. Pellerin, had seven children. Henrietta Lauzin (b.1842) was the daughter of Dr. Jean Lauzin and Leocadie Teetzman and the great-great-granddaughter of Antonio de Gras.	en	text	Palms, Francis F., 1837-1904.; Lauzin, Henrietta, b. 1842.; Louisiana--History--Civil War, 1861-1865.

Francis Palms, Camp Lovell, writes his friend, Henrietta Lauzin, Baton Rouge, teasing her regarding her recent letter to him and commenting on recent events within the camp.  He begins by thanking her for her letters and remarks on a recent letter in which she stated 'I have heard something lately. What would you give to know it?' He replies 'I will give you something I gave you the day we first parted on the 20th May next. Do you remember the something and the occasion?'. Regarding camp events, he comments on the bad news they have recently received, stating 'the papers bring us  discouraging news of that Battalion, for out of 750 men there are not more than 300 fit for duty', before informing her of a recent visit they received from 25 women on their way from Pattersonville, who treated them to a picnic lunch and a dance.	Francis Palms (1837-1904) enlisted as a private in the Confederate Army on May 23, 1861, at Camp Moore, Louisiana.  He was assigned to Co.

Letter from Frank Babin to Henrietta Lauzin, 1864	Babin, Frank.	1864	1864	letter (2p.)	Frank Babin writes to Henrietta Lauzin, West Baton Rouge.  He discusses his sister's fianc, Mr. Caldwell, and stresses that although 'the Yanks banished him' he was no Confederate.  He states  'When the war broke out he pretended to be a good southerner, and all that- but as New Orleans fell- was he not among the first to meet the foe at B. Rouge and welcome them in town.'  He then comments on Henrietta's suitors, particularly a Mr. Jules A., and states that she should 'drop him at once, he is not of the right stripe.'  Referring to the state of their Company, he comments that more soldiers are deserting, stating that they are 'low-borned cowards... nothing but hog thieves and scoundrels.'  He closes by stating that  'I only loved Miss M---- and it grieves not a little to have to say give her up.'	Frank Babin enlisted as a private in the Confederate Army and was assigned to Company I, which was a part of the 2nd Louisiana Cavalry.  Henrietta Lauzin (b.1842) was the daughter of Dr. Jean Lauzin and Leocadie Teetzman and the great-great-granddaughter of Antonio de Gras.	en; fr	text	Babin, Frank.; Lauzin, Henrietta, b. 1842.; Louisiana--History--Civil War, 1861-1865.

Letter from Frank Babin to Henrietta Lauzin, 1864 Dec. 15	Babin, Frank.	1864-12-15	1864	letter (2p.)

Sometimes our poor beasts remain tied two and three days without so much as an ear of corn or blade of hay.'

Frank Babin enlisted as a private in the Confederate Army and was assigned to Company I, which was a part of the 2nd Louisiana Cavalry.
