LACOSTE. Frotn the Ficnyune. LATE FRO.M CAL1FORNL4. The steamship Philadelphia arrived ni New Orleans, from Chagres, via [lavana, bringing the California mails lo Dec. 15, The Philadelphia brings the CHliforniu mails, 367 passengers, (348 of whom are from Chagres, and 19 from Havana,) and about $30,000 :n gold to various per.-^oiis. The health of the Isthmus is generally good. At the time of leaving Havana iheri; were few American inerchantmeii in port and no U. S. men^of^war, though .several were expected. Among the passengers by the Philadel¬ phia we notice the name ofLeCjrand Smith. Esq., private secretary lo iMr. P. T. Barnum. Mr. Smith comes here for the purpose of inaking arrangements f.>r the reception of Jenny Lind, .vho, having closed her concerts at Havana, is about lenving i'rieje^r ihis CiiV''. Our California papers reach to the 15th ult. Another fire, though by no means ao destructive as the former ones, had oc¬ curred at San Francisco. It broke out in the new iron building of .Mes.srs. Cook, Brothers & Co., on Sacramento street, between ^iV'Iontgomery and LeidesdorfT streets.    The Herald says: The firemen and a large number of citizens were immedi.itely on the ground, and strenuous exoilions were put forth to confine the flames, lo the few buildings immediately surrounding the one in which the cnnflagralion originated. Fortunate¬ ly the tide was full, and scarcely a breath of wind was observable, which circum. stances alone intercepted a most extensive destruction of property. The flumes raged furiously, extending either way.and consumed the Itjrge woorlen building oc¬ cupied by iVlessrs. Butler & Baxter, on the corner of Leidesdorffstreet, and thai adjoining Messrs. Hawley, Sterling & Go's warehouse on tho west towards Monlgo« mery street. The building of .Messrs. Cook, Brothers & Co., in which the fife originated, was unoccupied, although, a large quantity of goods hud just been stored In  it, preparatory to occupation. The building occupied by FIawley,Si«r Img & Co., and Totten & Eddy, was on fire several times, but through "the great¬ est exertions was saved. The stocks of these firms, consisting of hardware and groceries, were vary heavy, and may bs set down as nearly a total loss from the effects of water and removal. The flames were here stopped in their progress up Sacramenio street, though the remainder of tha stores as far as Montgomery street were completely emptied of their contents and the building of Messrs. DeLong.Mc iNeii & Co., was razed. On the sirle to¬ wards LeidesdorfT street thegrealest exer- tio.ns wore jjiacessary lo prevent ihe.flames from crossing the street. The fine zinc building of Joseph L. Foisom, just erected on LeidesdorfTstreet took fire, and in order to save it from en¬ tire destruction, was partially razed. The flames were finally hemmed in, and by haif past 9 o'clock, all danger of further spread wag over. The following is a list of the principal sufferers, so far as they can be ascertain¬ ed: Cook, Brothers & Co., Totten & Eddy, Hawley, Sterling & C ?.. Board, man. Bacon & Co., goods damaged by water and removal; J M Huddarl, Butler & Baxiur, De Long, McNeil & Co.. S. Brannan. ( Braniiaii Row ) injured by water and tearing away of the balconies; Pacitic .Mail Steamship Company, by wa¬ ter; Dr. .Maroitp, J L Foi.som, and Bragg Whitlemore & Co. Besides these many are loosers by tho hurried removal of the merchandise, the streets being extremely muddy. The Herald in its summary of news says that business is dull. Prices of all descriptions of goods and merchandise ranging lower than ever before in Caiifur. nia. ileal estate both in San Francisco and in Sacramento had become a com. plete drug in the market, and indeed sales could not be cffoctei] on any terrn.s. Sup. plies of breadstuffs were constantly arriv¬ ing in every description of provisions. The aiiproaching session of the Leois-. lalure excites much interest. The canvass for U. S. Senator produced a good deal of feeling. Mr. Fremont, it is said, has no chance for reelection. Col. VVeller is the most prominent candidate in the field. The Ft6mont mi.[jing bill had been re- ceived with much dissatisfaction in all parts of the Stale. The mines have been very productive for the last month, and the quartz beds recently discovered give promise of ex¬ ceeding richness. The rain had not been sufficiently steady to forward mining op. eraiions. The cholera has disappeared from the country as an epidemic. Occasional cases still occur, but the alarm and consterna-- tion produced by its presence were fast wearing away from the minds of the cit¬ izens. We perceive that Gen. Wilson, late member of Congress from New Hamp¬ shire, is making political sjieeches in Cal ifornia. The Stockton Journal contains the foK lowing: We have just learned, as we are going to press, that a collision has ttiken place between the Americans and Indians at Moquelema Hill, or in the vicinity, in which 15 Americans were killed, and the same, or perhaps a larger number of In¬ dians fell. The gentlemen who informed us has just arrived in Stockton, but was so much excited, probably from passing un- scalched fiom the field of blood, that we could only  learn the above. These are probably Indians who have been driven from the Upper Sacramento region by the volunteer   force under Col. quarters; but if they expect by Hceina sooth, to find a more congenial fi<'ld to carry on iheir work of robbery aiid murr der in, they will find tisr-mselves most wofully mistaken. A man named Scruggs wns killed at Volcano Diggings, by a [lerson named Rhodes. The brio San Jacinto was wrecked on the bar at   Hiirnboldt B iv- The niiiitsry which under Col.Rod(j;fr' has been doing servii'p n(;aiiist llie Indians, has been disbanded at Placervilie; .'lO In¬ dians were killed in the difFcreiil skir- mishes. The troubles')r»in Indian"! have been driven hack into ihe mountains. The Stockton Jnnrnal states that a par¬ ty of citizens from that place, destined for the quartz region, east of Los Angt^ies. were attacked in the Tulare plain, beyond the Mariposa, by tho Indians, und it is re ported thit seven .^mprican."), who were out hun'ing riiufe?. ttnrijf^had been stolen from, their camp, were stiackod and kill¬ ed. Among the names reported as suf¬ ferers are Capt.Powell, Jack Rvan.Frank Ross and Robert Collins. Mr. W«liis, « member of the Stockton City Council,was one of the party. A filace call Btirns's Quartz Diggings, is now attracting great aitention. The Jiiurnal slates th^.t 10,000 men can mine profitably for half a cen'ury in and about Burns's. The Times savs that Ihe vein uT Buins's Diggings alnne, wo^ild sfT^rd profitable employment for all the people at present in California for 500 years to come. Of this quartz, it is proved thiJl the average yield will be one dollar to the pound weight of qinrtr. The coMest weather of the senson ws-^ experienced at San Francisco jost before the steamer h ft. Ice a quarter of an inch thick was formed. We take the following from the Sin Francisco Herald: On the 8th day of February, 1819, the fore and aft schooner William and Eliz abelh left tha port of Nf!wOrlea,T9, bound for San Fr«ncisco' having on bo»rd a car- 20 of assorted merchandise. Sliew.isto have touched at Rio Janerio and Valpa raiso, but nothing ha.s ever be^cn heard of her since. She had on board as su. percargo, Mr. Henrv Kendig, a youns man twenty.fmr years of age, s eon of Mr. Benjamin Kendig, of this city; and that gentleman has requested us to notice the sailing of this vessel, in the hope that it may be seen by some one who could give information of her wreck, if wrecked she unfortunately be. At a place called Gra.ss Valley gold has been discovered. A quarlT, vein hss been found there which bears gold «o strongly that good wages have been made by men with a common hammer, who broke up the rook r.ti.«'. [.icked _r».,ii il>« eol i in lump?, varying in value from s bit to one dollar. The quartz bears gold so abundantly that many miners have des- erted old claims and located new one* on this vein. The q'larll is about foii'r limeg as rich ss quarts which is worked in the North Carolina mines, and consideri-d rich. Mr. Thomas O'Donnell was killed at Sacramento City by the premiture burst¬ ing of a log which he was bla<iling. Mr. William DeCiare, of Providenc*, R. I., was robbed and murdered near Coloma. A new town called Hamilton city, on Feather river, is growing up with great rapidity. The population of Butte county, Cali/- forma, is 12.000. Gpitrge Rogers, from Clarke county. Mo., and two othiT men, perished in the snow. Miners on the east branch oftho North Fork of Feather river are generally ay. eraging from ten lo sixteen dollars per day, whilst many are making far more.-- Some of those located on Rich bar and Smith's bar are receiving large yields. There is a company in California called the Garde Mobile. A letter writer from Grass Valley says to it : "The arrival of the Garde Mobile in our diggings excited considerable inter¬ est. Tniay loC'ited, without knowledge of the laws of rules governing the mines, upon some other claims; but as soon as their chic*, a native ot Louisiana ascer¬ tained the fact, he removed the men of his party frotn the same, and requested to have a transcript of the laws of regU'« lations of the lorahty in regard to pres emptions, and said he vtould have it re¬ ligiously observed." A rich lead mine has been discovered in California. The Placer Times learns that a new bar was discovered on Deer Creek, about a mile and a half below Nevada city, which was yielding very largely—from thirty to forty dollars to the pan full. The bar is said to be quite extensive. New dry diggings have also been dis¬ covered at a point called "Miles' Run, about two miles east of Nevada city, o" the Truckee river route, which are said to yield from three to five dollars to th^ pan. It is found in a flat, from three t" six feet from the surface, in a greyish clay of a very hard substance. The same paper says : The rich vein of quartz which was re¬ ported to have been discovered in the vis ciniiy of Grass Valley, turns out to have been greatly exaggerated. Instead of its being a vein, there was only occasionally a lump of quartz found among large stones which contained' gold. Shtifts were sunk to the depth of eight feel, but without success, as water prevented fur¬ ther progress. A yam weighing 203 pounds has beenl raised in a garden at San Francisco. The Placer Times gives Ihe following account of the result af a tour through the Of the places on Humboldt Bay, Eu¬ reka lias the undisputed preference, both for its mfrhimH ficililies. being the head of navigation, and its inexhaustible ro. sources in timber. .\3 depots for sup« plies of the mines as f,ir as yet explored, none of Ihe towns on Ihe jbay can rival Klamath. If there is an exception to this, it is in ¦summer with reference to the older mine* on the Trinity, winch is now deeinod of secondary importance, compared with the later discoveries on other Itibolaries uf the Klamat'i. During the dry season, wlien the Klamath is not navigable for more than forty miles up to the rapidi*, a>,d nearly the whole transportation, ia therefore by land, their greater proximity 10 San Francisco mav give some oppor- lumiy to the lower towns, but in the ntn- lei, wlien steamers will be able to go to the forks of the Klamath, there can bo no competition. T-riiiided, whl-sli is^vhirKy !,riic= r\iiiner north than the bay, would be preferred were the harbor mors secure, and that could be rendered a good one by building a breakwater from Ewing Blufl'to Pilot Rock. With this improvement it would be a perfectly .«afe anchorage, and easy of access in any season, which Huinboldt bay is not. Our previous information did not lead lo a« favorable consideralion of the advantages of Trinidad as further in» quiry has warranted. It has been repor¬ ted as nearly deserted, but it appear er¬ roneously. There are some fifty houses built, and most of them will be occupied this winter. From f rinidad to thejunc" tion of the Klamath and Trinity, the dis' ttince if sixty miles, to Klamath city fif. ty-two miles. The trail from Uniontown goes through Trinidad, and benrfs down the coast, passing below several lagoons before striking northeasterly for tho Forks. This road, except the portion thiough the Bed Wood.s, could be wag* onej. From the Forks to Salmon rivei" IS Iweiityfive miles, to Scott's river forli^ miles, and to Shasta sixty miles. Tha route is impracticable except for mulea No roads had been opened from Kla« math city direct to the principal placer* on tho Shasta, Salmon and Scott's  rivers. Klamaih is laid out upon a level flat, at an elevation above the river to sscure it from overflow, to which most of the eoun. try from that point down is subject, as tfia flood marks indicate, lo a depth often or twelve feet. Fifteen miles north of Kla¬ math a range of hills are found, in which extensive dry diggings are reported. The stories of gold being found on the sea shore, south of the mouth of iha river, are much exaggerated. The sand does con¬ tain some visible particles, Ltit not to any valiiableextent. Redwood creek, which has been can- si-i'^red an FtfiLtoril ctT !;;c-K:r:r:;;i:t], -finriit its way into the ocean about thirty miles above Trinidad, Along the coast from the month of Redwood creek to Eel river a success¬ ion of lagoons occur having no outlet lo 'he sea. We ate told that some of iheso show evidences of being lately closed from connection with the ocean, while others are very near renewing it. Mr. Hawks saw one where the water was running out to the sea over a narrow bar, which the tendency of tha tide was evi¬ dently to remove, and he entertains the opinion that Humboldt Bav is liable to the same mutations which the lagoons are Quwexhibiting. ChlorhFOR.m.—The   Academy of Sci. ences has just received two communica» tions of much interest  upon Ihe   subject of Chloroform.    One of   these    is   from !\L Ed.   Robin, and   the other from M. .Augendre, a French gentleman, resident in Constantinople.      Each  professes  to have discovered about the same time, and without    any   communication   with one another, another   remarkable property of this agent.  It appears to be an anti-seep» lie  of marvellous   virtue, preventing ani¬ mal decomposition after death, or prompt. ly checking   it if  already commenced,— Muscular flesh  and    all   animal tissues, when   Fuhjecied   to   its  action,   become fixed for ft long  period of lime in the pre' else   form   and  condition   in  which they may happen to be at the moment of appli- cation,  and   natural colors,  even   lo iha slighest and most delicate shades, are prei« served without  change.      The   memoirs have both been handed over to a commis¬ sion of the Academy for examination,— Experiments will be repeated in the pre- sence   of   the   commission,  and will be made the  subject of a   future  report.     If the promises (if the   sanguine discoveries are even nearly realized—if,tn addition lo its anesthetic qualities.it posseses the new virtues ascribed to it, chloroform will rank among the very first of the benefits con¬ ferred bv science upon humanity. Among the new uses to which it  may   he applied are the conservation  of  animal food,  in« string fresh nieat during the whole course of long sea   voyages,   the preservation of military and naval stores, and the keeping in muteums   of   anatomit'al   specimens, wliicb, as hitherto  kept   in alcohol, soon loose   the  original   size, form, and  color, becoming almost useless for the student's purposes,     it n'lay be efliiciently used for disinfecting the pestiferom atmosphere of dissecting  rooms,  rendering   the dissec tion    of   the   human    body—hitherto so loathsome and so   dangerous—a compar¬ atively    agreeable    and   harmless office. Chloroform will Afford,   too, the conven¬ ient and cheap means of preserving from corruption,   and  in    a    perfectly natural state, the bodies of friends, which, for re¬ moval or for other  purposes,   it   may b« desirable   lo   keep   uninterred   an usual length of time.    These are only a few of the long lists of benefits which chloroform. c. .    . ,     ,,      in its new application, is  destined lo-cott-i Rodgers, which went out to chastise them 1 northern   mining diotricts   made   by .Mr-   ^^^ for their nuinerous depredations in those' Wm- H.

C:>- The Soir6e of Tuesday evening last was brilliant and dashing beyond precedent. We do not recollect having ever seen on any festive occasion, even in the palmiest days of Natchitoches, so large and gay an assemblage of ladies and and gentlemen. The dancing was con¬ tinued to a late hour, agreeably varied by an elegant supper, to whose merits a very general approbation was accorded. We have on our table a very minute and beau¬ tifully written description of many of Ihe fair ladies, whom to gaze upon, is to have a foretaste of Paradise; but we are unable to publish it in our present number, Skills announced that Jenny Lind will make her firs.t appearance in New Orleans, at the St. Charles Ttieaire, on the lOlh February, Her success in Ha¬ vana has been complete, and she comes to us in Louisiana covered with laurels extorted from the most accomplished mu. sical auditory (save that of N. Orleans) in America. No doubt her success in the lattercity will be as triumphant as it has been elsewhere. We would give some¬ thing very handsome lo listen to her.— We place music at the head of all the oris, and not second even to poetry. Such, we think, is the real opinion of the vast majority of the world, although rarely avowed, by reasons of a ridiculous affec* tation of literary taste, very fashionable now-a.days, especially among bread and butter Misses.

It may not be denied that we have labored diligently and faithfully—that we have been true to our faith and to our colors— that we have never given "to party what was meant for mankind,"—that wa have risen above parly and sectional reclama¬ tions when they conflicted with what we considered to be the good of the coun- iry,—and that, above all, we have striven to mete out with impartial band equal jus tice to all men, upon the broad Christian principle of doing to others as we would have them do to us. In congratulating ourselves, then, on the rigid justice of our course and the suc¬ cess which has attended it, we would do violence to our feedings ware we not to acknowledge, with gratefulness, the en- couragment and assistance » hich has been for many years and by so many friends kindly extended to us. The duties of a a journalist are by no means light or plea¬ sant. We are not of the class of persons who like Festus believe tbat much learning will make one mad ; but we are of those who knoto that its pursuit m the rambling and sinuous roads which an editor has lo travel, is not always agreeable or profits-- ble. The very diversity of subjects on which he must daily read and sometimes write, may be likened to the entertain ment one might be supposed to derive from the perusal of a dictionary. Mira. beau said that a man perfectly acquainted with a subject must sometimes submit to be taught by another who knows nothing about It; daily experience proves the truth of the observation. Doubtless we have sinned in the same way, but we are more sinned against than sinning. It will ad. mit of a grain of dubitation whether a se. cond Omar would not prove a benefactor of the human race : the Jacobin who, in the first French revolution, proposed lo make a bonfire of all the books in France» was not so mad as he was thought to have been. The few good works that have been written will hardly compensate for the damage occasioned by ti.e ten thou, sand bad ones that deluge the world. It is true, none are compelled lo read except editors—the more's the pity—but that proves the sadness of their predicament, and the large extent of indulgence that ought to be extended to them. When we sometimes hear a fair lady in her teens, discoursing about Pope, or that favorite of the sex, ".\nacreon iMoore," we almost wish that they h«d never written a lino; when we hear a gray.haired man appeal lo an English historian for truth, we feel inclined to pitch him into the well where truth, for lime immemorial, has dwelt. Now, on the Editor's table lie the cerulean lucu. brations of countless Misses, and the dogmatic disquisitions of a wilderness of grey-haired sciolists. Newton (we think it was) with all his vast knowledge, said that he was but picking up shells by the borders of the great ocean—Truth. One of the seven Sages said that the only thing he knew was, that he knew nothing.— Que sais^je ? exclaims that rare genius, Montaigne, \yedo not mean to say that there is not knowledge and learning in the world, nor that the "sweet food of sweetly uttered knowledge," as Sir Philip Sidney expresses it, is not delightful and refreshing and profitable : but before we reach the Delectable Mountains, from which we can behold the fair city shining afar ofl^, what sloughs and gins and pit. falls,and all maimer of snares and springes are to be avoided in the wearisome search for it. A toilsome and a sad life, then, is that of the journalist, who has to fritter his lime and his brains in the perusal of num. berless paragraphs, from which to extract a single useful idea or hint; and who finds^himself continually immersed in seas of nonsense that are drivelled out by al- most every body, upon almost every sub¬ ject. No wonder, therefore, that men of taste sometimes labor under a sort of lite, rary hydrophobia, and that a draught even from the pure waters of the Pierian Spring occasionally throws them into con¬ vulsions. But, leaving a.side these desultory re>. flections into which we have unconscious ly fallen, and about which we fear not many will be found to agree with us, we may be permitted to believe that we have not been altogether unworthy of the gen. erotis patronage which we have received in our not over-pleasant duties as the conductor of a weekly journal. In com¬ mencing our eighth volume, we have de (KT* There has been no election, thus far, of U. States Senator by llie Massa¬ chusetts Legislature- We much fear, i lermined to devote an increased measure ffom present appearances,that the Demo, of •i'"^ snd attention to its improvement- crats and Free-soilers have coalesced for While we shall not lose sight of the great the purpose  of electing Sumner, one  of   political interests, which now, more than human considerations, we shall not fail to lead our readers, so far as our poor means will permit us to do so, into those primrose and pleasant paths of literature into which we, like others, are sometimes seduced. In conclusion, we beg to remark that there are still some persons who ought to be among our subscribers, but whose names are not upon our list. We beg lo remind such, that we consider ourselves entitled to the support which every re¬ spectable name in this and the other Red River Parishes ought to afford lo the prin¬ cipal newspaper of the region ; and that the commencement of the eighth volume is a very appropriate time for beginning their acquaintance with us. THE COALITION  IN MASSACHU¬ SETTS. We vary much fear that the unholy coalition between the Democrats and Free-soilers, in the Massachusetts legisla¬ ture, is a fixed fact. The right minded men of all parties denounce it in unmeas¬ ured terms of reprobation. The demo crats have the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and the free-soiiers are to have the Senators, viz, Rantoul for the short term, and Sumner for six yaars. So far, a few dissidents have refused to vote for these as agreed upon in the united caucus. Oo the last ballotting, Suratier whBted six votes of being •'ected. The Wash¬ ington Union, while it exposes in the ful^ lowing article, the infamy of this disgrace¬ ful and corrupt coalition, holds out some faint hope that it may not be successful. We confess that we entertain no such ex¬ pectation. We are too well acquainted with the fanatical atmosphere of Boston which, to breathe only, is to become aU most poisoned with every unwise and un¬ worthy prejudice, delighting lo parade it¬ self under the misapplied nanie of philan¬ thropy. One of the first writers and moat profound thinkers in America has said> that unless some speedy stop can be put to the so-called philanthropic asstciations. every honest man will.before many years, be obliged to leave the place where they flourish. Now, Boston is the city of broad phylacteries and long faces, and we fe«r very much that these will triumph over her many grest men and patriotic citi" zens, than whom none mors eminent are to be found io any city in the Union,or who have more ably and courageously sustained the cause of the country against the unprincipled disorganizers of both the North and the South: MORE OF THE C0.4LITI0N. The eyes of the whole country ere at this moment turned with eager gaze upon the pro. great of events in the city of Boston. Never was an auction sale more openly announced by advertisement, bell, and cry of Ihe auctions eer, than ia this great sale of offices in the legislature of Massachusetts. In defiance of appearances and of public opinion, this ar¬ rangement between the high coniracting parties has been negotiated, by caucuses of the parties engaged, with the moat unscrupulous boldness, and the whole coun ry is invited to look on and see how the servants of the people can barter off honors and places as they would purchase articles in the markets—for a price. Our own impression, on a view of the whole matter, is, that Ihe coalition will be exploded. Public opinion is awakening lo the infamy ot this iransaeiion, and there is hope that it will fhame those who are participating in it to abandon the scheme, There is butoneaenti' ment among honest men everywhere on the subject; and that is, that the project ia alike disgraceful, corrupt, and dangerous.— The proceedings of the Salem meeting, which we published on Sunday, are well entitled to the serious consideration of the public. The resolutions adopted, and th« letter of Mr. Bradford, are ia the highest strain of patriotic and manly indignation The spirit and tone ihatprevads themare of the true stamp of those '•times that tried men's souls." Great occasions like this develop the latent energies of public feeling, and arraign offenr ders for trial before the bar of society, in a mode 10 terrify them from acts of outrage. Po' litical associations may take place between those who have acted in dilferent parties, when no sacrifice of principle is involved nordaneer to the public welfare hazarded, without exoil. ing the jeslous indignation of ihe people. But in acase like this, where principle,public good, the safety of the Union, the triumph of fanati. cism, are all higgled away for a "little brief authority," no words are strongenough to give utterance to the feelings of aliaorence which ought to be aroused. We are glad to see that the democratic parly is taking this matter in hand, and reading the friends of this unholy confederacy a lesson that they will not be like, ly to forget. We trust that every honest man in iWasiachusetfs wiUspeakout in condemnation o( this flagitious proceeding. U. S. MINT STATISTICS FOR 1850. The Philadelphia American is indebted to Edward C.

The lirsl bottle pro¬ duced a decided and favorable efleci, relieving her more than any prescription she had ever ta¬ ken, and before she had used six boitles, to tile astonishment and delight of ail her friends, she found her health quite restored. Itis now over a year since ihe cure was effected,and her health retnains good, showing the disease was thor¬ oughly eradicated from the system.

This beautiful and convenient application of the mys¬ terious powers of GALVANISM and MAGNETISM, has been pronounced by distinguished physicians, both in Europe and the United States, to be the most valuable medicinal discovery of the ^.Jge. Dr.  CHRISTIE'S GALVAWIO  BELT MAGNETIC  FLUID, H used with the most perfect and certain success i« all cases of GENKUAl.

CC^ In NERVOUS COMPLAINTS, Drugs and Medi¬ cines increase the disease, for they weaken the vital ener¬ gies of the already prostrated system : while, under the strengthening, life-giving, vitalizing influence ofGal- vanism, as applied by this beautiful and wonderful dis¬ covery, the exhausted pintient and weakened sufferer is restored to former health, strength, elasticity and vigor. The great peculiarity and excellence of Dr. Christie's Galvanic Curatives, consists in the fact that they arrest and cure disease by outward application, in place of the usual mode of drug¬ ging, and physicking the patient, till exhausted Nature sinks hopelessly under the infliction. They strengthen the whole system, equalize the circtt- lation of the blood, promote the secretions, and never do the slightest injury under any circumstances. Since their introduction in the United States, only three years since, more than 60,000   Persons including all ages, classes and conditions, among which were a large number of ladies, who are peculiarly subject to Nervous Complaints, have been ENTIRELY AND PERMANENTLY CtTRED, when all hope of relief had been given up, and every thing else been tried in vain ! To illustrate the use of the GAI.VANIC BEt.T, suppose the case of a person afflicted with that bane of civilization, DYSPEPSIA, or any other Chronic or Nerv¬ ous Disorder. In ordinary cases, stimulants are taken, which, by their action on the nerves and muscles of the stomach, afford temporary relief, but which leave the patient in a lower state, and with injured faculties, after the action thus excited has ceased. Now compare this ¦with the effect resulting from the application of the GAL¬ VANIC BELT. Take a Dyspeptic sufferer, even in the worst symptoms of an attack, and simply tie the Belt around the Body, using the Magnetic Fluid as directed. In a short period the insensible perspiration will act on the positive element of the Belt, thereby causing a Gal¬ vanic circulation which will pass on to the negative, and thence back again to the positive, thus keeping up a con¬ tinuous Galvanic circulation throughout the system. Thus the most severe cases of DYSPEPSIA are PER¬ MANENTLY CURED. A FEW DAYS IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO ERADICATE THE DISEASE OF YEARS. CERTIFICATES AND TESTIMONIALS Of tJic most Unaoubtetl Character, From all parts of the country could be given, sufficient to fill every column in this paper AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE, which conclusiTcly proves that " Truth is stranger than Fiction." CURK    OF Rheumatism,   EroucMtia   and    Dyspepsia REV. DR. LANDIS, A CLERGYMAN of New Jersey, of distinguished attainments and exalted reputation:— SiDNET, New Jersey, July 12, 1S49. Db. A. H. Christie—Dear Sir: You wish to know of me wliat has been the result in my own case, of the application of THE GALVANIC BELT AND NECK- LACE.   My reply is as follows : For obout twenty years I had been Buffering from Dyspepsia. Every year the symptoms became worse, nor could I obtain permanent relief from any course of medical treatment whatever. About fourteen years since, in consequence of frequent exposure to the weather, in the discharge of my pastoral duties, 1 became subject to a severe Chronic Rheumatism, which for year after year, caused me indescribable anguish. Farther : in the winter of '45 and '46, in conse¬ quence of preaching a great deal in my own and various other churches in this region, I was attacked by the Bronchitis, which soon became so severe as to require an immediate suspension of my pastoral labors. lity nervous system was noio thoroughly pros¬ trated, aniTas my Broncliitis became worse, so also did my Dyspepsia and Rheumatic affection—thus evincing that tiiese disorders were connected with each other through the medium of the Nervous System. In the whole pharmacopoeia there seemed to be no remedial agent which could reach and recuperate my Nervous System ; every thing that I had tried for this purpose had completely failed. At last I was led by my friends to ex¬ amine your inventions, and (though with no very san¬ guine hopes of their efficiency,) I determined to try the effect of the application of the GALVANIC BELT AND NECKLACE, with the MAGNETIC FLUID. This was in June, 1846. To mt grkat astomshmknt, iw two DAYS BIT  Dyspepsia  had  goke ;   in  eight  days I was ENABLED TO IIE3UME MY PASTORAL LABORS, NOR HATE I SINCE OMITTED A SINGLE SERVICE OW ACCOUNT OF THE BrOSCHITIS J AND MY RhEUMaTIC AFFECTIOI? HAS EN¬ TIRELY CEASED TO TROUBLE ME. Such Is the wondcf- ful and happy results of the experiment. I have recommended the BELT and FLUID to many who have been likewise suffering from Neuralgic affec tions.   They have tried them, with  hafpv results, I BELIEVE,   IN   EVERY   CASE. I am, dear sir, very respectfully yours, ROBERT W. LANDIS. on. chrTstie's GALVANIC   NECKLACE Is used for all complaints affecting the Throat or Head, such ss Bronchitis, Inflammation of the Throat, Nervous and Sick Headache, Dizziness of the Head, Neuralgia in the Face, Buzzing or Roaring in the Ears, Deafness, which is generally Nervous, and that distressing com¬ plaint, celled Tic Doloreus. Palsy and Paralysis. AU physicians acknowledge that these terrible dis¬ eases are caused by & deficiency of Nervous Energy in the affected limbs. Dr. Christie's Galvanic Articles wiu supply this deficient power, and a complete and entire cure is thus effected. DR.  CHRISTIE'S GALVANIC   BRACELETS Are found of vast service in cases of Convulsions or Fits, Spasmodic Complaints, and gfeneral Nervous Affections of the Head and upper extremities. Also in Palsy and Paralysis, and all dis'eases caused by a deficiency of power or Nervous Energy in the limbs or other organs of the body. Tic Doloreux and Neuralgia. Those dreadful and agonizing complaints are immt' diately relieved by the application of the Galvanic Belt, Necklace and Fluid. The Belt diffuses the Electricity through the system ; the Necklace has a local effect, and the Fluid acts directly upon the affected nerves In these distressing afflictions the application NEVER FAILS. FITS   AND   CONVULSIONS. These alarming and terrible complaints are always caused by a derangement of the Nerves. The Belt, Bracelets and Fluid will cure nearly every case, no matter how young or aid the patient, or how confirmed the complaint. Numerous and astonishing proofs are in possession of the proprietor.

These Medicines have now been before the public for a period of FrFTEEN YEAES, and during that time have maintained a high charac¬ ter in almost every part of the jjlobe for their ex¬ traordinary and immediate power of restorinir per¬ fect health to persons sutFering under nearly every kind of disease to which the hmnan frame is liable. m MAF? THOUSAITDS of certificated niatances, they have even rescued snfTerers from the very verge of an untimely grave, after all thaaepeptivo nostrums of the day had utterly fdilejd ; and to many thousands they have permaneiitVy secured that uniform enjoy¬ ment of health, without which life itself is but a partial blessing. So great, indeed, has their efficacy invariably and infallibly proved, that it has appeared scarcely less than miraculous to those who were acquainted witli the beautifully philosophical principles upon which they are com¬ pounded, and upon which they consequently act. It was to their manifest and sensible action in purifying the springs and channels of life, and en¬ duing them with renewed tone and vigor, that they were mdebted for their name. Unlike the host of pernicious quackeries which boast of vegetable ingredients, the LIFE MEDI¬ CINES are purely and solely vegetable;   and contain neitiier Mereury, nor Antimony, nof Arsenic i^or any other mineral, in any form whatever. They are entirely composed of ex¬ tracts from rare and powerful plants, the virtues of which, though long known to several Indian tribes, and recently to some eminent pharmaceu¬ tical chemists, are altogether unliuown to the ignorant pretenders to medical science ; and were never before administered in so happily efficacious a combination. The first operation is to loosen from the coats of the stomach and bowels the various impuri¬ ties and crudities constantly settling round them ; and to remove the hardened fffices which collect in the convolutions of the small intestines. Other medicines only partially cleanse these, and leave such collected masses behind to produce habitual Costiveness, with all its train of evils, or sudden Diarrhoia with its imminent dangers. This fact is well-known to all regular anatomists who ex¬ amine the human bowels after death ; and hence the prejudice of these well-informed men against the quack medicines of the  age.    The second effect of the VEGETABLE LIFE MEDI¬ CINES 'S to cleanse the kidneys and the blad¬ der ; and, by this means, the liver and lungs, the healthful action of which entirely depends upon the regularity of the urinary organs. The blood, which takes its red color from the agency of the liver and lungs, before it passes into the heart, being thus purified by them, and nourished by food coming from a clean stomach, courses freely through the veins, renews every part of tlw system, and triumphantly mounts the ban¬ ner of health in the blooming che^k. The following- are among the distressing va¬ riety of human diseases m which the VEGIi- TA^LE LIFE MEDIGIKES are weU known to ho infallible. ,        , DYSPEPSIA by thoroughly cleansing the first and second stomachs, and creating a flow ol pure healthy bile, instead of the stale and acrid kind ; Flatulency, Loss OF Apptr.'TE,^KsAKT- BOR.N,   IIk.ID.ICOK,   RESTLESSNESS,   IlL-'1 EilFEK, Anxiety, Langoor, and Melancholy, v.'hich are the general symptoms of Dyspepsia, will vanish, as a natural consequence of its cure, Costiveness, by cleansing the whole length of the intestines with a solvent process, and without violence ; all violent purges leave the bowels costive within two days. Diarrhoea and Cholera,, by removing the sharp acrid fluids by whieh these complaints are occasioned, and by promoting the lubricative se¬ cretion of the mucous membrane. Fevers of all kinds, by restoring the blood to a regular circulation, through the process of perspi¬ ration in such cases, and the thorough Solution of all intestinal obstruction in others. The Life Medicines have been known to cure Eheumatism permanently iu three weeks, and Gout in half that time, by removing local inflainiualion from the muscles and ligaments of the joints. Dropsies of all kinds, by freeing and strength¬ ening the kidneys and bladder : they operate most delightfully on these important organs, and hence have ever been found a certain remedy for the worst cases of Gravel. Also Worms, by dislodging from the turnings cf the bowels the slimy matter to which these creatures adhere. Asthma and Consumption, by relieving the air-vessels of the lungs from the mucous which even slight colds will occasion, and which, if not removed, becomes hardened, and produces these dreadful diseases. Scurvy, Ulcers, and Inveterate Sores, ^r the perfect purity which these LIFE MEDI¬ CINES give to the blood, and all the humors. Scorbutic Eruptions and Bad Complex¬ ions, by their alterative etfect upon the fluids that feed the skin, and the morbid state of which occa¬ sions all eruptive complaints, sallov/, cloudy, and other disagreeable complexions. The use of these Pills for a very short time will effect an entire cure of Salt Rhoum, and a striking improvement in the clearness of the skin. Common Colds and Influenza win always be ;ured by one dose, or hy two even iu the worst fftses. FILES. As a remedy for this most distressing . nd obstinate malady, the VEGETABLE LIFE iUEDICINES deserve a distinct and emphatic ecommendation. It is well-known to hundreds m this city, that the former proprietor of these valuahle Medicines was himself afflicted with this compaint for upwards of TiimTY-FiVE years ; and that he tried in vain every^ remedy prescribed within the whole compass of the Materia Medica. He however at length tried the Medicine which is now offered to the public, and he was cured iu a very short time, after his recovery had been pro¬ nounced not only improbable, but absolutely im¬ possible, by any human means. FEVER AND AG-UE. For this scourge of the western country these Medicines will be fouu<J'a safe, speedy, and cer¬ tain remedy. Other medicines leave the system subject to a return of the disease—a cure by these medicines is permanent—TRY TIIEM, BE SATISFIED, AND BE CURED. Bilious Fevers and Liver Complaints. General Debility, Loss of Ai-i-KrrrE, and Diseases OF Feihales—these medicines have been used with the most beneficial results in cases of this description:—King's Evil and Scrofula, in its worst forms, yields to the mild yet powerful action of these remarkable Medicines. Night Sweats, Nervous Debility, Nervous Com¬ plaints of all kinds. Palpitation of the HEAax, Painter's Colic, are speedily cured. MERCimiAL DISEASES. Persons whose constitutions have become im¬ paired by the injudicious use of Mercury, will find tliese Mediehies a perfect cure, as they never fail to eradicate from the system all the effects of Mercury infinitely sooner than the most powerful preparations of Sarsaparilia. A single trial will place them beyond the reach of competition, in the estimation of every patient. BE CAREFUL OF COUNTEEFEITS.
