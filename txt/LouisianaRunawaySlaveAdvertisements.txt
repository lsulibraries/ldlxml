RANAWAY from the subscribers, on the 17th day of September last, a negro man named MORRIS, about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of dark mulatto color, and is easily identified by his upper fallen eye-lids. Also, at the same time, a young woman named JUDE, about 17 years of age, and perhaps the same color as Morris. She is rather bonny in her appearance, and it is probable she would attract the attention of a certain class of amateurs. She is no doubt harbored in Alexandria, or near that places. I will give $50 for the delivery of both to me, or $25 each. S.W. GORDON.
