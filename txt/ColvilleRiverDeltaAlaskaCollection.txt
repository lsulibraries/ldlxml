Guidebook to permafrost and related features of the Colville River Delta, Alaska	Walker, H. J. (Harley Jesse), 1921-		1983		Morphology;Colville River Delta (Alaska);Permafrost;Hydrology;	70.22,-150.50	The Colville River Delta is the terminus of the Colville River in Arctic Alaska which drains some 29 percent of the North Slope. The delta is composed of many of the features of other deltas and also such features as ice wedges, ice-wedge polygons, frost mounds, and pingos and is virtually all underlain by permafrost. This guidebook provides information about the delta's setting, climate, morphology and hydrology. Thirteen field sites located along the Nechilik (western-most) Channel are described. They include details about a Gubik Formation which is being undercut by the river, about lake tapping by the river, and about the development of Nuiqsut.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

The actual numbers were difficult to determine and further changes occurred with time and stage. Those enumerated here were determined using 1;62,500 topographic maps, There are some 53 bifurcations, 29 rejoinings, 34 months and 5214 routes to the sea for water that passes the head of the delta. River channels range in width to more than one km and in depth to more than 12 m. Cross-sectional and longitudal sections were echo-sounded at many locations and are displayed.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

Draining about 53,000 km, the river has a length of more than 600 km and a basin perimeter of 1650 km. Along with its tributaries it drains parts of three physiographic provinces. The basin is asymmetrical with few tributaries draining from its left. This report provides statistics and maps of 56 third-order basins which form the basis of most of the statistical analyses.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

Colville River Delta: Section F	Walker, H. J. (Harley Jesse), 1921-		1980		Climate;Colville River Delta (Alaska)	70.22,-150.50	This section of the Colville River Delta series details information about the delta's weather and climate. Because there was no Weather Bureau data for the delta, a first approximation was made by analyzing the data from Barrow and Kaktovik which are about equally distant from the delta. Some further data was added from Oliktok (a DEW Line Station near the delta) and field-camp observations. Included is information about solar radiation, albedo, temperature, precipitation, fog and wind.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

Winter water sources in the American Arctic	Walker, H. J. (Harley Jesse), 1921-		1961;1961		Water;Arctic regions;Arctic;Winter;	70.22,-150.50	Much of the Arctic abounds in water because of the presence of numerous lakes and rivers. However, such a condition only occurs during the short summer. During most of the year, liquid water is rare and only occurs beneath the ice in the deeper lakes and river channels. Although much snow and ice are present, converting them to liquid water is time consuming and expensive. Because permafrost dominates, ground water is usually unavailable. The article describes the various techniques used in the production of water in the Arctic.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

Unusual weather and river bank erosion in the delta of the Colville River, Alaska	Walker, H. J. (Harley Jesse), 1921-		1980	Arctic Institute of Norh America	Climate;Colville River (Alaska);Bank erosion;Erosion;Permafrost;Frozen ground;	70.22,-150.50	During the summer of 1961, the weather occurring in the Colville River Delta in Arctic Alaska was more rainy and windy than normal according to a local resident. It was a summer in which west winds that are often accompnied by rain, were common. During the strongest west winds of the summer, undercutting of the right bank of the wide main channel of the river was severe and bank collapse common.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

Permafrost and ice-wedge effect on river bank erosion	Walker, H. J. (Harley Jesse), 1921-	Arnborg, L.	1966;1966	NAS/NRC	Geomorphology; Colville River Delta (Alaska) Permafrost; Frozen ground;	770.22,-150.50	Permafrost and ice wedges are two of the many factors that affect the morphology and dynamics of riverbanks along arctic rivers including the Colville River in Alaska. Permafrost is especially important because it gives riverbanks sufficient stability to allow undercutting by river water through the process of thermo-erosion. The cornice that develops is subject to collapse, and ice wedges, when present, influence the nature of collapse by providing lines of weakness along which fracturing can occur. Undercutting and collapse vary with the composition of the riverbank materials as well as with the hydrodynamic conditions of the river. In the Colville River, bank retreat tends to be less rapid in banks composed of peat tha it is in banks composed of sand and silt.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.

River bank dunes in the Colville Delta, Alaska	Walker, H. J. (Harley Jesse), 1921-		1967;1967	Coastal Studies Institute, Baton Rouge, La.	Sands dunes;Colville River Delta (Alaska);Riparian areas;Winds;	70.22,-150.50	Among the many distinctive surface features found in the Colville River Delta are sand dunes. Most stablized dunes are vegetated and very few display blowouts. Active dunes are found in two general locations; namely: 1. at the delta front and 2. along the left bank of river channels opposite sand bars. During spring thaw wind commonly blows sand from river bars up on to the leeward surface discoloring the snow. These wind-caused stripes are quite conspicious during late spring.		en	Image	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	Physical rights are retained by the LSU Libraries.
