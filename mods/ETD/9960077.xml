   <abstract type="Abstract">"The primary purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of accurate/inaccurate teacher instruction, high/low teacher delivery and on-/off-task student behavior on musicians' evaluations of teaching effectiveness. An additional purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in the musicians' evaluative responses of teacher effectiveness would occur due to differences in their experience level.;Subjects (N = 168) were musicians and were grouped accordingly: (1) grades 6--8; (2) grades 9--12; (3) undergraduate; and (4) experienced teacher. The subjects viewed and evaluated a videotape of eight teaching segments for teacher effectiveness. The segments had been simulated by the investigator and seven upper-elementary music students in order to create the appearance of an elementary music classroom getting. Each segment had been executed by the students and teacher according to eight original scripted music lessons, each of which required the simulated class to act according to different combinations of the variables within the areas of accuracy of instruction, teacher delivery, and student behavior. Data were collected via an Effective Teaching Response Form, which required the subjects to rate each teaching segment for teacher effectiveness using a 10-point Likert scale and provide three comments as to why each rating was assigned for each segment.;Results indicated significant differences due to experience level and teaching segments. Additionally, a significant interaction was found among the four groups across teaching segments. Further examination of the subjects' group mean ratings and evaluative comments indicated that: (1) high and low teacher delivery affected the response ratings of the middle and high school students more than any other variables; (2) accuracy of instruction affected the response ratings of the experienced teachers more than any other group; (3) student attending behavior affected the response ratings of the middle school students more than any other group; (4) inaccurate instruction, low delivery, and off-task student behavior affected the response ratings of the undergraduates and experienced teachers more than did the variables of accurate instruction, high delivery, and on-task student behavior."</abstract>
