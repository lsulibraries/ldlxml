   <abstract type="Abstract">"The object-oriented paradigm and client/server and distributed technologies have become widely used in the last decade. There is an increasing interest to migrate and reengineer legacy systems to these new hardware technologies and software development paradigms. Software engineers who wish to reengineer such legacy systems face challenges, such as lack of documentation and programs that are difficult to comprehend. Middleware technologies such as CORBA and DCOM make the development of new distributed systems, as well as the migration of legacy systems to distributed platforms, more feasible. Distribution of a system consists of two parts: (1) subsystem decomposition and (2) allocation of the subsystems to different sites.;In this research, we define a reengineering environment that assists with the migration of legacy systems to distributed environments. We define a reengineering methodology that uses reverse engineering, software metrics, clustering, and data mining to migrate legacy systems to object-based distributed environments. The reengineering environment includes the methodology and an integrated set of tools that support the implementation of the methodology. The methodology consists of multiple phases. First, we use reverse engineering techniques for program comprehension and design recovery. We then decompose the system into a hierarchy of subsystems by defining relationships between the entities of the underlying paradigm of the legacy system. The decomposition is driven by data mining, software metrics, and clustering techniques. Next, if the underlying paradigm of the legacy system is not object-based, we perform object-based adaptations on the subsystems. We then create components by wrapping objects and defining an interface. Finally, we allocate components to different sites by specifying the requirements of the system and characteristics of the network as an integer-programming model that minimizes the remote communication. We use middleware technologies for the implementation of the distributed object system."</abstract>
