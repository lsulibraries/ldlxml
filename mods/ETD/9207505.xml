   <abstract type="Abstract">"The objectives of this study were to: describe training and human resource development (T&amp;D/HRD) certificate programs in the United States, compare the demographic characteristics of certificate programs among academic groupings, and to determine the perceived degree of influence of various factors on the development of T&amp;D/HRD certificate programs.;A researcher designed questionnaire was administered to the population of U.S. institutions offering T&amp;D/HRD certificate programs identified by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) 1990 Academic Directory. An 84.2% rate of return was received from the respondents in this study.;Findings indicated that T&amp;D/HRD certificate programs are more likely to be located in communities with an industrial base consisting of business services, finance, insurance, banking, or manufacturing. Almost two-thirds of the institutions offering T&amp;D/HRD certificate programs offer graduate credit for program participants. When comparing the academic groupings of T&amp;D/HRD certificate programs, more programs were found in business departments than in other departments.;Most (59.4%) T&amp;D/HRD certificate programs emphasize trainer roles and competencies equally. Factor analysis was used to determine the perceived influence of 53 factors that impact the development of T&amp;D/HRD certificate programs. The top three factors perceived as having the most influence were: changed work environments, career development, and clientele of certificate programs."</abstract>
