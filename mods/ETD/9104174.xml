   <abstract type="Abstract">"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of self-evaluation by beginning wind instrumental students of defined musical and behavioral objectives. Specific areas in which effects were studied included attitude, physical playing fundamentals, and musical/technical skill development. Attitudes examined included students' attitude toward (a) school, (b) band, (c) instrument, (d) practice, (e) band director, and (f) self. Behavioral/musical objectives examined included (a) tone; pitch; rhythm notes (technical accuracy); and playing position (posture, embouchure, hand position); and (b) ""practiced at home."".;Before initiation of the study, all students completed an attitude questionnaire and played excerpts from their class work. Performances of group and individual playing were recorded, numbered, and randomized for subsequent analysis.;Following pretest administration students in the experimental group were instructed in the use of self-evaluation forms, and began the self-evaluation phase of this study. The control group proceeded as usual while the experimental group used self-evaluation forms each day.;Videotaping of both groups was done each day. Pre and postexperimental tests were conducted concerning attitude, individual, and group performance. Analysis of video data indicated higher percentages of on-task in the experimental group in every category.;Comparison of pre and postexperimental attitude test data revealed different trends between control and experimental groups. Control group scores remained somewhat static while some experimental group scores indicated significant gains.;Analysis of preexperimental performance scores indicated that the control group scored significantly higher in areas of pitch and technique than did the experimental group. Analysis of postexperimental performance scores indicated no significant difference between groups. Considered with preexperimental differences in performance, it seems logical to conclude that the experimental group made greater progress in performance areas than the control group. Difference scores pre to post tended to substantiate the above findings.;Findings of this study indicate that use of some form of self-evaluation may increase learning and enhance attitudes of students involved in wind instrumental classes. Additional investigation would help to verify the conclusions of this work and possibly lead to more effective instruments for student self-evaluation."</abstract>
