   <abstract type="Abstract">"In this study, the researcher investigated visual arts teacher preparation programs at universities in Louisiana with particular emphasis on the curriculum component. The research was designed to survey teacher training programs and to compare the findings with delineated National Art Education Association standards.;This study included only public institutions of higher education in Louisiana with visual arts education teacher preparation programs. The researcher conducted interviews at each of the 13 universities. Two of the universities worked together in a joint art education program. An interview guide was prepared and used to facilitate the interviewing process. Records and documents were also examined to collect data about each of the programs.;The researcher used the data collected to prepare profiles for the universities. Each of the programs was then compared to delineated standards to determine discrepancies in the programs.;Important findings of the study included: (a) the curricula in the 12 art education programs varied significantly in the major content area, (b) each of the visual arts teacher training programs had discrepancies in their art requirements when compared to the National Art Education Association standards, (c) Louisiana state guidelines for visual arts teacher preparation programs varied from delineated National Art Education Association standards, (d) the number of visual arts education graduates in the past decade varied substantially from the number of visual arts education students being certified, and (e) the number of visual arts education students has declined in the past ten years.;After examining the data and findings, the researcher recommended that visual arts teacher preparation programs in Louisiana work to comply with the National Art Education Association standards. It was also recommended that programs address the specific shortcomings in course requirements, course offerings, and faculty competencies."</abstract>
