   <abstract type="Abstract">"This study consists of the extension of the Behavioral Classification Project upward into the adult age range. The instrument developed for the Adult Behavioral Classification Project (AdBCP) is an extension of an existing series of instruments ranging, in coverage, from the pre-school to adolescent ages. This study initiated the construction of and initial standardization of an instrument which will be used to determine dimensions of problem behavior which are to eventually be used as the basis for a system of classification.;The literature regarding issues of classification and difficulties with present classification schemes is reviewed. Alternate classification systems are considered.;The AdBCP instrument designed for this study is a 536-item true-false questionnaire composed of items which are behavioral; that is describe behaviors that can be seen, heard, or smelled by an observer, and which require minimal interpretation on the part of an observer. The instrument was administered to 615 subjects comprised of clinical and non-clinical groups ranging in age from 18 to 65. The 249 clinical subjects, persons receiving psychotherapy, included in-patients and out-patients of public institutions as well as out-patients of private practitioners. The non-clinical group consisted of 366 subjects, 203 of whom are college students.;The completed protocols were analyzed by a principal components factor analytic procedure (VAND 500). Thirty factors were retained, rotated orthogonally then obliquely. Twenty-four of the oblique factors were interpreted. Factor scores were obtained for eighteen of these factors across seven major diagnostic groups. The relationship among AdBCP factors and factors obtained by other researchers and prior BCP instruments is discussed. Criticisms and ramifications of this project are discussed as are plans for further development."</abstract>
