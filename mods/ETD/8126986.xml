   <abstract type="Abstract">"The problems investigated in this study were:  (1) Does the use of redundancy and analogies to emphasize the main verbal scientific concepts of an instructional unit facilitate comparable learning for field independent (FI), intermediate cognitive style (ICS), and field dependent (FD) undergraduate college students? (2) Are there differences in the aural, visual, and preferred sense recall of FI, ICS, and FD undergraduate college students?;The population consisted of undergraduate education students at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge during the Spring Semester, 1981. The sample was all students enrolled in six sections of two media courses.;Instruments used were the Hidden Figures Test (HFT) to measure field dependency, a slide-tape test to identify sense recall and preference, and two multiple choice tests to measure concept acquisition.;The procedure entailed three periods: first, to measure field dependency and aural vs. visual recall and preference; second, to present an audiotape using redundancy and a nine-question test; third, (one week later) to present an audiotape using analogies and a nine question test.;The design of the study was randomized completely with post-tests only. These hypotheses were tested using one way Analysis of Variance; there are no significant differences in:  (1) information acquisition by FI, ICS, and FD subjects when redundancy is used in instruction, (2) information acquisition by FI, ICS, and FD subjects when analogies are used in instruction, (3) aural recall of the FI, ICS, and FD subjects, (4) visual recall of the FI, ICS, and FD subjects, (5) preferred sense recall of the FI, ICS, and FD subjects, were tested using one way Analysis of the Variance.;None of the F values of the ANOVAs were significant at the .05 level. All the null hypotheses were accepted. The conclusions were:  (1) the amount of information acquired by the FI, ICS, and FD subjects was comparable, (2) There was no trend in the auditory, visual and preferred sense recall for the three groups.;Since the findings failed to demonstrate the variance between FI and FD subjects established by previous research, the results were interpreted as reflecting the effectiveness of redundancy and analogies in assisting all learners in identifying and acquiring the relevant aspects of the material."</abstract>
