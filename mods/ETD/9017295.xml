   <abstract type="Abstract">"Cloacal and tracheal swabs were collected from 1,389 hunter-killed ducks in Cameron Parish, Louisiana during the 1986 and 1987 waterfowl seasons. These included 605 blue-winged teal (Anas discors), 75 mottled ducks (A. fulvigula), 375 gadwalls (A. strepera) and 334 green-winged teal (A. crecca). Twenty-eight avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated. Prevalence estimates of AIV in ducks during September, November and December/January were 3.1%, 2.1%, and 0.4%, respectively. Differences in prevalence were detected by season ($P$ =.044) and age class ($P$ =.036). Two isolations from resident mottled ducks indicate local transmission of AIV on these wintering areas.;Much subtype diversity was present with 9 of 13 HA and 9 of 9 NA subtypes recovered. Predominant subtypes were typical of AIVs commonly associated with waterfowl.;A plaque assay served as an in vitro test of pathogenicity. Results for 18 of 28 AIVs were consistent with expected values for viruses of low-pathogenicity in chickens.;Linear regression models for five AIVs demonstrated that at an initial titer of 1 $\times$ 10$\sp6$TCID$\sb{50}$, infectivity would persist in distilled water for up to 207 days at 17 C and 102 days at 28 C. Significant differences in slope were detected between temperature treatments and between AIVs.;Combined effects of water temperature, salinity and pH on AIV persistence were evaluated in a model distilled water system using three isolates. Variables were tested within ranges normally associated with surface water. Differences were detected between temperature (17 C and 28 C), pH (6.2, 7.2, 8.2) and salinity (0 ppt and 20 ppt) treatments with a strong interactive effect observed between pH and salinity. The estimated duration of infectivity for 1 $\times$ 10$\sp6$TCID$\sb{50}$ of A/mottled duck/LA/38M/87 (H6N2) under test conditions ranged from 9 to 100 days. Differences in response to these variables were apparent between viruses.;The ability of AIV to persist in surface water was evaluated using water samples collected from varied waterfowl habitats in coastal Louisiana. Results were consistent with the model system."</abstract>
