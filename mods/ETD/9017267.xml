   <abstract type="Abstract">"The focus of this dissertation is to develop an efficient framework for sequential execution of logic programs. Within this framework the logic programs are executed by pruning the goal-search tree whenever applicable.;Three new concepts for pruning of computation during execution of logic programs are introduced. (1) Failure-binding. A Failure-binding for a literal is a binding which when applied to the literal fails the goal obtained from the literal. Failure-bindings for a literal are identified by analyzing the goal-tree of a goal which is obtained from the literal. The failure-bindings for a literal are used for intelligent backtracking based on the generator-consumer approach. Intelligent backtracking based on failure-bindings prune the computation of search space which lead to late detection of failure. (2) Failure-solution. A Failure-solution of a goal is unacceptable to some other subgoal in the forward execution. Failure-solutions of a goal are identified by analyzing the history of computation, during execution. Failure-solutions of the goals are used for intelligent forward execution. Intelligent forward execution prunes the computation of search space which leads to repeated failure resulting from repeated successes of a goal. (3) Forward jumping. Forward jumping is a method to avoid reexecution of some subgoals after backtracking (instead of naive forward execution after backtracking). Forward jumping is based on the dynamic subgoal dependencies in a rule. Such jumping prunes the computation of the search spaces which leads to the same sequences of successes of subgoals after backtracking.;To facilitate the implementation of these concepts a new data structure, called segmented-stack, is defined. The space complexity of a segmented stack is linear in the number of nodes in the stack. Depth-first search as well as breadth-first search are very easily implemented on a segmented-stack during execution of logic programs. Execution of logic programs on a segmented-stack allows association of the search space, as well as the solutions, of a goal with the frame of the goal. This enables implementation of intelligent backtracking, intelligent forward execution and forward jumping.;The search based on each of these paradigms is proved to be sound and complete. It is also shown that the implementation of these paradigms preserves the order of results obtained by Prolog. The effects of the non-logical operators, in Prolog, on the paradigms are studied. The search based on the these paradigms is compared individually, and collectively, with the standard search by Prolog."</abstract>
