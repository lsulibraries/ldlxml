   <abstract type="Abstract">"The spread of itchgrass (Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.) Clayton) throughout the sugarcane (Saccharum interspecific hybrids) area is of growing concern to producers in Louisiana.;At Maringouin and Thilbodaux, LA, season-long itchgrass interference reduced sugarcane stalk populations, cane yields, and sugar yields 34, 42, and 43%, respectively, compared to no itchgrass interference. Stalk populations and cane and sugar yields were comparable for early-season (from spring until layby on June 12) and season-long itchgrass interference with late-season (from layby on June 12 until harvest) being similar to no itchgrass interference.;Good to excellent early-season itchgrass control was obtained with pendimethalin at 2.2 and 3.4 kg/ha plus atrazine, prodiamine at 1.7 to 2.8 kg/ha, clomazone at 1.1 to 2.2 kg/ha, and fomesafen at 0.8 to 1.1 kg/ha at two locations. Late-season itchgrass populations were reduced at least 80%, at the Loreauville site. BAS 514 at 0.3 to 1.1 kg/ha, metribuzin, and atrazine provided poor control. Only clomazone injured sugarcane, but the bleaching of foliage was short-lived. In a field study, which supported the results observed in the greenhouse, a postemergence application of asulam at 3.7 kg/ha reduced dry biomass 89%. Nicosulfuron at 9 to 35 g/ha reduce itchgrass dry biomass 77 to 89%, but control with primasulfuron methyl at 34 and 67 g/ha and KIH 2665 at 112 g/ha was poor. Over-the-top application of nicosulfuron at 18 to 67 g/ha at Maringouin and Thibodaux, LA, reduced sugarcane stalk populations at least 91% compared to the untreated check. Stalk populations were reduced 93% at Maringouin with primasulfuron methyl at 34 g/ha but were unaffected by KIH 2665 at either location. Postemergence-directed application of nicosulfuron also caused significant sugarcane injury. Paraquat at 560 g/ha and ametryn at 2.7 kg/ha applied post emergence reduced itchgrass infestation levels. Although injury was observed with paraquat, there was no reduction in stalk height, stalk number, or sugar yield."</abstract>
