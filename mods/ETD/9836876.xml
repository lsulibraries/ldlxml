   <abstract type="Abstract">"This study was designed to explore the status of learning types of clinical laboratory science university faculty and their use of information technology in the classroom. Traditionally clinical laboratory science education has been lecture and lab sessions. However, with the advent of the information age, professors are moving from the role of lecturer to facilitator. Some professors are in tune with the new information tools while others are not interested at all.;This research had a two-fold purpose: (1) to explore who was using technology in the classroom and identify what they were using, and (2) to search for a possible relationship between a professor's learning type and the use of information technology in the classroom. To meet these ends, the researcher chose to conduct a national survey of university-based clinical laboratory science professors. A national list of faculty was compiled and a random sample was chosen. This study employed a commercial learning type tool (McCarthy's Learning Type Measure) and a self-designed information technology use instrument.;Data received from the survey were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS. Descriptive statistics were performed using the demographic variables, learning types, and information technology use scores. Two one-way analysis of variance were performed, one with the technology scores and the highest preferred learning type quadrant and one with the technology scores and the lowest preferred learning type quadrant. A significant difference was found between the technology scores and the highest preferred learning type quadrant. A Tukey's analysis indicated a significant difference between the use of information technology for quadrant three learners and quadrant two learners. A multiple linear regression was run with the technology score as the dependent variable and the learning type quadrant and demographics as the independent variables. Seventeen percent of variance in the technology scores was explained by the independent variables which were loaded into the regression equation.;This research indicated that there was a relationship between the respondent professors' learning type and their use of information technology in the classroom. Although this cannot be generalized to the population, the researcher would recommend this topic for further study."</abstract>
