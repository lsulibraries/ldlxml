   <abstract type="Abstract">"Search for a meaningful relationship between job satisfaction and job performance has continued for more than three decades. Despite ongoing theoretical, empirical and practical interest, research findings have been inconclusive. Literature reviews indicate that there still exists much confusion concerning the relationship between satisfaction and performance.;Three conceptualizations of the relationship between satisfaction and performance have been proposed: (1) satisfaction is an antecedent of performance (a view associated with the early ""human relations"" school of thought); (2) the view that performance leads to satisfaction (through its impact on intrinsic and extrinsic rewards); and (3) the view that the relationship between satisfaction and performance is moderated by other variables. Each of these conceptualizations have been empirically tested.;Employee turnover has received attention from both managers and academicians for many years. The conditions which lead to an individual's decision to leave an organization are not fully understood today, despite many years of research attention.;Of particular interest to the dissertation research was the interaction of individuals and their environment in predicting employee performance, job satisfaction and employee turnover in a sales setting. Therefore, this study examined individual variables, situational variables, and their interaction. It also addressed possible factors related to the lack of consensus regarding job satisfaction, employee performance and employee turnover (i.e., theoretical, measurement and methodological issues)."</abstract>
