   <abstract type="Abstract">"This study (1) described secondary business educators on demographic variables; (2) described the self-directed learning level of business educators according to the OCLI and Bartlett-Kotrlik Inventory of Self-Learning; (3) determined if relationships existed between learning levels and selected variables; (4) developed a graphic model to explain the relationships of self-directed learning level; (5) determined if demographic variables can be used to explain variance in self-directed learning level; (6) determined if demographic variables can be used to explain variance in self-directed learning level; and (7) determined if the perceived importance of learning resources can be used to explain variance in self-directed learning level.;Most Pennsylvania business educators were female, married, caucasian, tenured and experienced in the classroom. Business teachers are moderately-strong self-directed learners according to the Bartlett-Kotrlik Inventory of Self-Learning and higher than average according to the Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory.;The grand mean of the self-learning resources was identified as important to learning on the job and was the only demographic variable that explained variance in self-directed learning levels. The learning resource experimentation, media (audio, T.V., video tapes), preparing to teach, consultation, and electronic media explain variance in self-directed learning level.;Developing business teachers' abilities to be self-directed learners within pre- and in-service teacher education programs, and placing teachers within a supportive environment results in self-directed workplace learners. Teacher educators should integrate self-directed learning within the curriculum."</abstract>
