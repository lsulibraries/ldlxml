   <abstract type="Abstract">"Two-hundred and thirty crude organic extracts from 118 plant species distributed among ten families of higher plants have been evaluated for antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H$\sb{37}$Rv) and M. avium using the BACTEC 460 radiorespirometric assay. At 100 $\mu$g/ml, twenty-four and ten of the extracts caused more than 95% inhibition of growth of M. tuberculosis and M. avium, respectively.;Bioactive chromatographic fractions of Borrichia frutescens (Asteraceae) provided two new triterpenes and one known cycloartenol. In radiorespirometric bioassays against M. tuberculosis, the new (24R)-24,25-epoxycycloartan-3-one and the known (24R)-24,25-epoxycycloartan-3$\beta$-ol exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 $\mu$g/ml. In contrast, the new (23R)-3-oxolanosta-8,24-dien-23-ol showed no significant inhibition at 128 $\mu$g/ml.;In an attempt to study the structural dependence of antimycobacterial activity of the highly active guaianolide dehydrocostus lactone (MICs of 2 and 16 $\mu$g/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. avium, respectively) and its derivatives, and to determine configurational and possible conformational effects upon activity, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid oxidations of dehydrocostus lactone were performed. Three new monoepoxides, one previously synthesized diepoxide, and two new diepoxides were obtained, all of which showed strongly reduced antimycobacterial activity.;Antimycobacterial root extracts of Inula helenium and Rudbeckia subtomentosa were chemically investigated. Chromatographic fractions of active root extracts of I. helenium provided the known eudesmanolides alantolactone, isoalantolactone, and 11$\alpha$H, 13-dihydroisoalantolactone. Active fractions from root extracts of R. subtomentosa gave the known alloalantolactone and 3-oxoalloalantolactone. All natural and semisynthetic eudesmanolides were tested for biological activity against M. tuberculosis and demonstrated MICs ranging from 8 $\mu$g/ml for 5,6$\alpha$-epoxyalantolactone to $&gt;$128 $\mu$g/ml for 11,13-dihydroisoalantolactone and 11,13-dihydroxyalantolactone.;Methanol extracts of fruits of Melia volkensii were chemically investigated and shown to contain two new triterpenes and the known triterpenoid kulonate. The structures of the new 12$\beta$-hydroxykulactone and 6$\beta$-hydroxykulactone were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR experiments and FABMS studies. All three triterpenes exhibited significant activity against M. tuberculosis with MICs ranging from 4 $\mu$g/ml to 16 $\mu$g/ml."</abstract>
