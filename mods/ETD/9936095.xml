   <abstract type="Abstract">"The colorless square-planar cluster [CuN(SiMe3)2] 4, which contains four Cu(I) ions with four bridging amide groups, was studied as a precursor for chemical and photochemical vapor deposition of Cu metal. The cluster phosphoresces in CH2Cl2 solution and in the solid state at room temperature. Its electronic spectrum in CH 2Cl2 consists of two intense bands which are assigned to symmetry-allowed 3d   &amp;rarr;  4p transitions; the phosphorescence is also likely to be metal-centered. Solid [CuN(SiMe3)2]4 luminesces with approximately the same spectrum as that of the CH2Cl2 solutions. At 77 K, the solid-state luminescence red-shifts slightly. The emission lifetime in glassy Et2O solution is 690 mus. [CuN(SiMe3) 2]4 deposits Cu metal via chemical vapor deposition under H2 carrier gas at substrate temperatures of 145--200&amp;deg;C. Deposition also occurs photochemically beginning at 136--138&amp;deg;C under near-UV irradiation.;The preparation of monomeric derivatives of [CuN(SiMe3) 2]4 was attempted by using neutral donor ligands L (e.g. LnCuN(SiMe3)2; L = CO, PR3, CN-t-Bu; n = 1--3). The target compounds were expected to be more volatile than the copper cluster and still maintain photosensitivity. CuCl and [Cu(CH 3CN)4]PF6 were used as starting materials. Even in the presence of L, [CuN(SiMe3)2] 4 is a major product in reactions using CuCl and NaN(SiCH3) 2- [Cu(CH3CN)4]PF6 was a promising route for the monomeric Cu(I) complexes because of ready dissociation of its acetonitrile ligands. However, the characterization of these complexes was unsuccessful.;Other Cu(I) amide clusters have been prepared; they may also be suitable for chemical and photochemical vapor deposition of Cu. [CuNEt2] 4, [CuN(i-Pr)2]4, and [CuN(t-Bu)(SiMe 3)]4 are phosphorescent though they are very air sensitive. They should be more volatile and produce Cu metal films more readily than [CuN(SiMe3)2]4 Cu(hfac)2 is a versatile Lewis acid, forming adducts with a variety of bases. The bases that were used were ethylene glycol, 2-methoxyethanol, propylene glycol, and 1-methoxy-2-propanol. Each Cu(hfac)2 adduct deposited Cu metal under H2 gas at a substrate temperature of 200&amp;deg;C and precursor temperature of 80&amp;deg;C. In contrast to previously known adducts with alcohols, the new precursors do not require excess alcohol vapor for stability. Nevertheless, no Cu deposition was observed with these precursors in the absence of H2 at temperatures up to 135&amp;deg;C."</abstract>
