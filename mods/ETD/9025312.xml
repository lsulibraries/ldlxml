   <abstract type="Abstract">"The acute toxicity of permethrin to red swamp crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) was evaluated in laboratory studies. The mean static acute 96-h LC50 of permethrin to red swamp crawfish 8-12 mm (0.017 g), 25-35 mm (0.64 g), 45-55 mm (2.45 g), and 65-75 mm total length (TL) (8.98 g) was 0.44, 0.85, 1.30, and 0.81 $\mu$g/L, respectively. Permethrin toxicity did not differ among immature male, mature male and female P. clarkii. Crawfish surviving permethrin exposure exhibited no differences in post-exposure growth, survival, maturity attainment, or the production of viable young when compared to non-exposed controls (P $&gt;$ 0.2). At the third-instar stage of development, no evidence of teratogenesis was observed in crawfish produced from permethrin-exposed parents.;The 24-h LC50 of permethrin to red swamp crawfish (31 to 70 mm TL) in pond water ranged from 1.0 to 3.1 $\mu$g/L. Permethrin was applied to shallow earthen ponds at concentrations of 1.0 to 3.0 $\mu$g/L and population estimates conducted 12-13 days post-treatment indicated that pond crawfish populations were reduced by 54.4 to 83.1% for P. clarkii and 100.0% for P. acutus acutus. Crawfish less than 40 mm TL had higher mortality (range of 55 to 84%) than larger crawfish (range of 42 to 79%). Among crawfish greater than 40 mm TL, mature males had higher mortality (33 to 100%) than immature males (range of 43 to 86%) and females (range of 30 to 72%). No permethrin residue could be detected in crawfish abdominal muscle (detection limit 6.7 ng/g) or hepatopancreas (detection limit 400 ng/g) by gas chromatography.;The use of permethrin to effect density reduction in combination with supplemental feeding was evaluated as a management technique to minimize stunting of crawfish at sub-marketable size. Crawfish populations which were fed formulated feed at a rate of 28 kg/ha three days per week had more harvestable crawfish (greater than 75 mm TL) (mean = 29%, P = 0.01), larger mature males (means = 70 mm TL, P = 0.01), greater total weight of crawfish harvested (mean = 300 kg/ha, P = 0.18), greater number of crawfish harvested (mean = 35,470 crawfish/ha, P = 0.16), and higher CPUE (mean = 0.16 kg/trap-set, P = 0.001) than crawfish populations receiving no formulated feed from April to June."</abstract>
