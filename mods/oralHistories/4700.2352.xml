   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Adams_Harold_and_Louise_T3951.pdf">Harold and Louise Adams discuss their courtship while they were both students at
            Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, and the earlier years of their marriage while
            they were both teachers. Harold discusses his career as an educator, which includes
            serving as a teacher and principal in Golden Meadow Public Schools and working for a
            federal education program. He also discusses education reform and his approach to
            discipline and dealing with the parents of students. Harold discusses the sense of
            community in Golden Meadow and how it has changed, including Cajun culture and the
            growth of ethnic and religious diversity. Harold discusses his, and his children's,
            relationship with Catholicism. He discusses the growth of auto culture, the oil
            industry, and chain commercial stores in the area. Harold and Louise share memories from
            Hurricanes Juan and Betsy and the current developments in levee construction in the
            region. They discuss concepts of home and community, as well as the role of boats and
            bridges in the bayou.</abstract>
