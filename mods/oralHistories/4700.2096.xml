      <description>"Velton Guidry was born in 1930 and lived in Galliano, Louisiana. He was
            one of seven children of Gracien and Augusta Choest Guidry. Velton Guidry was married to
            Gertrude ""Gertie"" Kiger Guidry, and had two sons, Lenard and Jeffrey. He served in the
            U.S. Army, was a fisherman since he was 13, and was an amateur genealogist later in
            life, focusing on local Cajun culture. He was a parishioner at St. Joseph Catholic
            Church in Galliano and died on May 27, 2011."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Guidry_Velton_T3942.pdf">Guidry discusses his family's genealogy and his interest in Cajun genealogy and
            historical research in general. He tells about his education to the seventh grade, which
            included corporal punishment, and his Catholic upbringing. His mother worked in a shrimp
            factory and his father was a fisherman. His large family was somewhat isolated from the
            poverty of the depression because they grew so much of their own food and his mother was
            very resourceful. Guidry discusses shrimping as a teenager, trapping, and oystering. He
            recounts childhood games and beginning to fish at 13. He recalls a childhood vacation to
            Barataria Bay, which included harvesting bigorneaux (saltwater snails), a visit to Fort
            Livingston, and encountering an alligator. He recalls working on the water during World
            War II and seeing submarines and other wartime activity. Guidry also discusses the role
            of the church in the community (history and physical construction) and in his current
            life.</abstract>
