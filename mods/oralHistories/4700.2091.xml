      <description>"John ""Johnny"" William Barker was born in New Orleans in 1923, and was
            one of seven children to Frank and Florence Barker. He spent his first years in a house
            on Carrollton Avenue, across the street from the Notre Dame Seminary. His father, a
            sugar trader, moved the family to the Clotilda Plantation, outside Lockport, La. Barker
            attended St. Stanislaus High School and Louisiana State University, where he studied
            agricultural engineering, and served in the U.S. Army during World War II, serving in
            the Pacific Theater. He married Aline Herbert of Larose and the couple had six children
            and numerous grandchildren. He is a fourth-generation sugarcane farmer and his
            professional career included work with Valentine Sugars (where Aline also worked),
            Bollinger Shipyards, and A.E. Staley. Barker lived at Clotilda Plantation until his
            death in 2012."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Barker_John_et_al._T3937.pdf">Barker recounts his childhood in Lockport, La., which included working and playing
            with other kids at the Clotilda Plantation. Barker discusses the sugarcane business,
            then and now, throughout the interview. He briefly discusses his education, which
            included an agricultural engineering degree from Louisiana State University, and his
            time in the armed forces during World War II at Camp Claiborne, Guadalcanal, and Japan.
            He discusses his concept of home and the role of Catholicism in his life. He and his
            wife (Aline) and niece (Dee Dee Gaubert) discuss the changes in Bayou Lafourche's
            commerce with the advent of the oil industry and topography due to erosion. Aline
            discusses her family's background and the role of French in her life. They discuss
            Valentine Sugar, both the processing of sugarcane and the development of paper
            products.</abstract>
