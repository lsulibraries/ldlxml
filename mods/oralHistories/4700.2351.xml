      <description>"Reynold ""Ray"" Adams, Harold's brother, was born in Golden Meadow, La.,
            around 1944 to Andrew Adams and Letucia Johnfroe Adams. He grew up on Bobs Lane, which
            was home to the Adams and the Collins extended families. Adams's father was a
            refrigeration engineer at an ice plant; Adams also worked there for 13 years after high
            school. In 1976 he became a Golden Meadow deputy police officer, and was eventually
            promoted to chief of police, a position from which he retired. Adams is a practicing
            Catholic. He is married to Judy Adams and has children and four
            grandchildren."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Adams_Ray_T3950.pdf">Adams discusses his childhood on Bobs Lane in Golden Meadow, La., and what children
            did for recreation, which included hunting and sports. He spent time with his father in
            the garden, hunting, and at church. He was raised Catholic and his father was
            particularly devout. Adams recalls the shrimp packing plants in Golden Meadow and
            discusses the local fishing culture, including recent developments. He discusses,
            throughout the interview, how Golden Meadow has changed, specifically the sense of
            community, commerce and development. He talks about his first job at the ice plant, and
            about the Golden Meadow Police Department, where he worked from 1976 to 2005. Adams
            recalls his grandparents and his family's Cajun heritage.</abstract>
