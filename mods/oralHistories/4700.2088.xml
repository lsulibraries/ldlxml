      <description>"Allen ""Al"" Danos was born in Cut Off, La., around 1947 and attended
            Holy Cross High School in New Orleans. In his early twenties he joined his father, Allen
            Danos, Sr., in the family business, Danos and Curole Marine Contractors; he and his
            brother Hank took over the company in the early 1970s. Since his retirement in the early
            2000s Danos has become a board member of Nicholls State University Foundation, a board
            member of the Houma-Thibodaux Diocese, and worked to develop tourism in Port Fourchon.
            He is a practicing Catholic, and lives in Cut Off with his wife. They have four children
            and five grandchildren."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Danos_Allen_T3934.pdf">"Danos focuses largely on his professional career with Danos and Curole, discussing
            domestic and international expansion efforts in the 1970s-1990s, with a particular focus
            on his work in oil production in Nigeria. He discusses his interest in the ""boat"" side
            of the business, and his activities since retirement in 2006. Danos discusses the
            Catholic community, his home life, Cajun heritage and current culture, and his regular
            gatherings with friends."</abstract>
