      <description>Lloyd F. Love was born in Monterey, La., in 1921 to Sadie White Love and
            James Hartwell Love. He had one brother, J.H. Love Jr. Love was valedictorian of his
            graduating class at Monterey High School and attended Louisiana State University from
            1938 to 1942, earning a bachelor's degree in forestry. As an ROTC cadet, he was called
            to active duty in the U.S. Army Air Corps upon graduation. He earned his wings in August
            1943 and flew 73 missions from Sardinia in a B-26 bomber. He served the remainder of the
            war flying out of Laughlin Field in Del Rio, Tex. After the war, Love intended to stay
            enlisted, but changed his mind after being set up on a blind date with Ann Jackson, whom
            he soon married. He started law school at LSU in late 1946 and served as Student Body
            President in 1946-1947. He received his LLB and JD degrees in 1948 and began practicing
            in Ferriday, La., that same year. Love dedicated much of his life to supporting LSU as
            member and 1959 president of the LSU Alumni Federation, a charter member of the LSU
            Foundation, and founder and past president of the Concordia Parish LSU Alumni
            Association. He successfully campaigned for construction of a ring levee in Concordia
            Parish, served as city attorney for the town of Ferriday, was active in the Rotary Club
            and Boy Scouts of America, and was recognized by the Louisiana Bar Association for his
            pro bono work. Love was the recipient of countless honors and awards for his military
            achievements, his work as a lawyer, his involvement with LSU, and his civic involvement
            in Concordia Parish and the state of Louisiana. He passed away in 2006 at age 84 and was
            survived by his wife and four children.</description>

            campus, tuition and scholarships, student jobs, his term as LSU Student Body President,
            his friends and fellow students, and other topics. He discusses his military and pilot
            training and WWII service with the U.S. Army Air Corps from 1942 to 1945. He outlines
            his involvement with the LSU Alumni Federation, the LSU Foundation, and other
            university-related endeavors. He talks about Concordia Parish, La., and his campaign to
