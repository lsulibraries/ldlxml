      <description>Loyman Melancon was born and raised in Cut Off, Louisiana, the youngest
            of five siblings. He grew up in a rural environment, relied on the bayou for
            transportation, and played sports at Cut Off High School (including on the 1953 six-man
            football team, which won the state championship). He married Mamie Eymard after
            secondary school; the couple had five children. Melancon worked in the oil industry
            until his father-in-law asked him to join his oystering business, which included a fleet
            of four ships. Melancon joined, and eventually took over, the business, from which he
            retired in 1985. In his retirement he travels and participates in groups to preserve
            Cajun French.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Melancon_Loyman_T3938.pdf">Loyman Melancon discusses his childhood as the youngest of five in rural Cut Off,
            Louisiana, in the 1930s and 1940s, including learning to swim, playing sports, childhood
            games, trapping with his father, and spending time with his widowed grandmother. After
            high school he married and worked in the oil fields, where he advanced through a number
            of roles, until his father-in-law asked him to join his oyster business. Melancon speaks
            at length about oystering, including salinity requirements, leasing and maintenance of
            oyster beds, dredging fresh oysters, steam plants, canning, predators, and the impact of
            the 2010 oil spill. He also discusses the role of French in his upbringing and his
            current efforts to preserve the language.</abstract>
