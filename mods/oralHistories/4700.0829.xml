   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/military/Turcan_Ida.abs.pdf">The interview details early to mid-twentieth century life in south Louisiana, and
            describes extensively one woman's experience as an armed services nurse overseas during
            World War II. Considerable detail is also given to Turcan's nursing experience during
            Hurricane Audrey, which hit Southwest Louisiana in 1957. Finally, Turcan speaks to the
            nature of contemporary military life, particularly on women's roles and scandals
            involving women in the military.</abstract>
