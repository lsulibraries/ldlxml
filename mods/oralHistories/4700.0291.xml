   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_faculty/Coates_Jesse_T371_T372.abs.pdf">Coates describes his family background; his father's, Charles E. Coates's, work to
            establish LSU's Chemistry Department; his youth spent on LSU's old downtown campus; his
            father's involvement in the Audubon Sugar School; early professors in the Chemistry
            Department including Raoul L. Menville, Arthur Choppin, and Raymond Fries; his mother's
            social and civic activities; the establishment of football at LSU and games on the old
            campus.; The interview discusses Jesse Coates's own career after joining LSU's faculty
            in 1936. It describes policies on hiring, research projects, jobs Coates held before
            coming to teach at LSU, and the curriculum at Michigan State University where he earned
            his Ph.D.; Coates describes equipping chemistry labs and developing research projects in
            the Chemistry Department, and his role hiring faculty as head of the department,
            including Frank Groves, James Cardner, Clayton Calahan, Ed McLouhlin, and Paul Murrill.
            Also described are Coates's marriage to Judith Mills Williams in 1938, his father's
            death, and his brothers, Victor and Charles.</abstract>
