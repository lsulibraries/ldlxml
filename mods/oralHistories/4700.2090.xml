      <description>Belonie Scioneaux was born in 1931 in Vacherie, Louisiana, the son of
            Ernest and Martha Scioneaux. His family was employed by a plantation on which they
            lived, and he began working at a young age. As an adult he worked at Avondale Shipyard
            for a time before leaving because of health problems. He married at least twice (second
            wife: Audrey Kraemer Scioneaux), and had several children and stepchildren. Scioneaux, a
            native French speaker and resident of Chackbay, enjoyed hunting and helping at his
            daughter's restaurant, Nocko's Deli, until his death in 2011.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Scioneaux_Belonie_T3936.pdf">Scioneaux discusses his childhood on a Louisiana plantation and his role in the
            workforce, as well as his job at the Avondale shipyard. He discusses his first wife and
            her infidelity, then tells an anecdote about his second wife and her eating habits.
            Scioneaux enjoys hunting and discusses his various guns, and shooting a rabbit. He
            explains his limited English, and offers some phrases in French.</abstract>
