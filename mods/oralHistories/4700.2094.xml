         <description>R. Gibbens Robichaux was born in 1930 in Thibodaux, Louisiana, son of
            Alfred G. Robichaux, Sr. and Sara Day Gibbens Robichaux. He had one brother, Alfred G.
            Robichaux, Jr. (ca. 1928-2012) and was raised in Thibodaux, growing up in a house across
            the street from his grandparents (Eugene Godfrey Robichaux and Brigeitte Emma Thibodaux
            Robichaux) and a few blocks from Bayou Lafourche. He attended parochial school; first
            Mt. Carmel Convent Academy (now the Carmel Inn), and then Brothers of the Sacred Heart
            School, from which he graduated at sixteen. He met his future wife, Joann, as a
            teenager. He attended Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama (his father is also an
            alumnus); both he and his dad played piano and had bands in college. Robichaux enlisted
            in the US Air Force and was stationed for twenty-five months in Okinawa, Japan, where he
            was a chaplain's assistant and learned to play the organ. He returned to the States,
            married his wife, and was stationed in Marietta, Georgia. After he returned to Thibodaux
            he taught briefly (seventh grade), then worked for the welfare office, before becoming
            the organist of St. Joseph Co-Cathedral in Thibodaux, where he worked for twenty years.
            He is still involved in the church and music communities in his retirement. He has
            written a number of children's books, wrote a regular column for the Thibodaux Chamber
            of Commerce newsletter, and has released three CDs of music.</description>
