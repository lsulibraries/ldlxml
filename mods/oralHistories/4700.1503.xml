         <description>Miles Edward Richardson was born in Palestine, Tex., to Mark Carl and
            Florence Adams Richardson in 1932. He dropped out of high school in December 1949, a few
            months before he was due to graduate, and immediately joined the U.S. Air Force.
            Richardson stayed in the Air Force for four years, serving in the Korean War while he
            was stationed in Okinawa, Japan, for two years. After leaving the service, he slowly
            began taking college classes and eventually wound up at Stephen F. Austin State College,
            where he completed his B.S. in biology and history in 1957. That same year, he started
            the master's program in anthropology at Louisiana State University. After only one year
            there, Richardson transferred to the Ph.D. program at Tulane University. While a student
            at Tulane, he married a fellow student, Valerie Woodger. Richardson was able to go to
            Colombia on a medical grant and he did his dissertation fieldwork in San Pedro,
            Colombia, in 1962-63. For the next two years, while completing his Ph.D. at Tulane in
            the summers, he taught at Indiana State College (now Indiana University of
            Pennsylvania). Richardson earned his Ph.D. from Tulane in the spring of 1965 and started
            teaching at LSU that fall. He remained at LSU as a professor of anthropology for the
            next forty years. He was Departmental Chair (1970-72) and Acting Chair (1986-87). He
            held the Fred B. Kniffen Professorship and the Doris Z. Stone Professorship and served
            in numerous professional organizations including the Society for Humanistic Anthropology
            and the Southern Anthropological Society. Throughout his career, he conducted fieldwork
            in the southern U.S. and Latin America and authored several books and numerous scholarly
            articles, as well as several poems and short stories. Richardson died at the age of 79
            on November 14, 2011.</description>
