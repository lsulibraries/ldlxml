      <description>"John B. ""J.B."" Barnes, Jr. was born in Clinton, La., around 1923 and
            was raised with a rural lifestyle in Baton Rouge. His father died when he was still
            young, so Barnes was raised by his mother and began to work and contribute to the
            household at an early age. He moved to Lockport, La., in 1954 for a job at the Valentine
            Sugar Company, where he worked on their Valite division and eventually became a
            plantation overseer, managing the labor force of hundreds, both black and white. After
            Valentine's closure in 1979 [1980], Barnes also worked as a water attendant at a sugar
            house in Raceland. He was a member of St. John Baptist Church in Clinton and Israelite
            Baptist Church in Lockport; he served as a church deacon and member of the choir at
            Israelite Baptist. Barnes, son of John Barnes, Sr. and Anna Thomas Barnes, was one of
            many children, and was married to Sally Barnes; the couple had five children and he
            mentored many more. He passed away in 2012 and is survived by three sons, one daughter,
            many grandchildren and great-grandchildren."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Barnes_John_B_T3948.pdf">Barnes discusses his childhood in Clinton and Baton Rouge, La., which involved
            being raised by his widowed mother and working from a young age. The family grew their
            own food and resources were scarce. As an adult Barnes helped raise a number of children
            in Lafourche Parish, and he discusses, at length, how Christian tenets have helped guide
            his life. He discusses the history and development of Israelite Baptist Church in
            Lockport, explaining his role as deacon and as a member of the church choir. Barnes
            sings two gospel songs. He discusses his professional career at Valentine Sugar in
            Lockport, where he climbed to the rank of overseer/manager, which caused some strain as
            Barnes is African American and many colleagues were white. After Valentine closed he
            worked night shifts at a sugar mill in Raceland. He briefly discusses the non-church
            community and changes in the physical community of Bayou Lafourche. Barnes's long
            medical history is also discussed.</abstract>
