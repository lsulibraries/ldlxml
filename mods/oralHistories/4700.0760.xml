      <description>Glen Lewis McMullen was born in 1945, in Washington, D.C. His father,
            Louie McMullen, was a World War II navy veteran who worked for the U.S. Coast and
            Geodetic Survey in New Orleans. His mother, Jean Cloud, was primarily a homemaker.
            McMullen grew up in Kenner, Louisiana, and attended East Jefferson High School in
            Metairie. He began his college career in 1963 at Northeast Louisiana State College, but
            soon transferred to LSU-New Orleans, and then to LSU-Baton Rouge in 1964. He received
            several degrees form LSU: a B.A. in Philosophy in 1968, an M.A. in European History in
            1972, and an MLIS in 1979. He has worked for the New Orleans Public Library, LSU
            Libraries, and the Indiana Historical Society. McMullen is now an independent contractor
            in publishing, living with his wife, Judy, in Austin, Texas.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_alumni/McMullen_Glenn_T1100_T1101.pdf">Glenn McMullen recalls his years at Louisiana State University as an undergraduate
            and graduate student in the mid to late 1960s and early 1970s. He discusses his
            anti-Vietnam War activism, especially a 1967 protest that he helped organize with fellow
            philosophy student, Don Baker. He shares memories of his ROTC duties, his fraternity
            involvement with Delta Tau Delta, a job at Edwards' Orange Bowl, and of philosophy
            classes, professors, and fellow students. He recalls people's reactions to the Kennedy
            and King assassinations. He discusses growing up in Kenner, Louisiana, his early
            education, high school fraternity culture, and a few memories of race relations and
            school desegregation.</abstract>
