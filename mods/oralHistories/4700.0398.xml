      <description>Albert L. Clary, Jr. was born in Opelousas, La., on 27 January 1926 and
            died on 21 April 1999 in Baton Rouge. He entered LSU as a student in 1942, but his
            service in the Navy during World War II interrupted his education. He returned in 1946
            and completed a bachelor of arts and master's degree in education. While teaching in the
            public school system from 1948 to 1950, Clary obtained a position at LSU as the
            assistant to the university registrar, but soon thereafter he was called to active
            service in the army for the Korean War. His service there included devising and
            implementing an education program for Chinese and Korean prisoners of war. In 1952 he
            returned to LSU as assistant to the registrar and became the coordinator of
            institutional research. Four years later he became the registrar of the university. Upon
            the dissolution of the registrar's office, Clary became the director of academic
            services. In 1986, he became the executive assistant to the vice chancellor for academic
            affairs. Clary retired from LSU in 1988. He was an active member in a number of
            professional organizations throughout his career including, AACRAO and
            SACRAO.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_alumni/Clary_Albert_all_tapes.abs.pdf">Clary discusses his family background and education, early experiences with LSU in
            the 1930s before attending, veterans, including himself, returning to the university
            after World War II and university issues specific to them after the war and his
            involvement in them. Clary also relates his military service during the Korean War.
            Additionally, he describes his participation in the changes in the LSU Office of the
            Registrar, including technology implementation, raising admission standards, and the
            university's admissions policy on African Americans and the desegregation of LSU. He
            also discusses administrative topics such as response to student protests, the growth of
            both the physical campus and university academic programs, and student discipline. Clary
            also remembers various administrators from his tenure at LSU.</abstract>
