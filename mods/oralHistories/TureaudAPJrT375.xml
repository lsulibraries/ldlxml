            <description>Alexander Pierre Tureaud Jr. is one of six children born to Alexander
                Pierre Tureaud Sr. and Lucille Dejoie Tureaud. He attended Joseph S. Clark High School
                in New Orleans and attempted to enroll at Louisiana State University in 1953, but his
                application was denied because he was African American. His father, a prominent civil
                rights attorney, filed suit against the university to have him admitted. Tureaud became
                the first African American to enroll at Louisiana State University as an undergraduate.
                He attended LSU for six weeks until the ruling was overturned and he was forced to leave
                the university. He finished college at Xavier University and became an educator in New
                York.</description>

        <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/integration/Tureaud_A.P._Jr._T375.abs.pdf">Tureaud discusses the six weeks he spent as an undergraduate at Louisiana State
            University in 1953 including his father's legal proceedings to have him admitted, the
            treatment he faced from students and professors, his disappointment in missing out on a
            typical college experience, and his loneliness and isolation while at LSU. He recounts
            many specific instances of racism, harassment, and discrimination, but also discusses
            some positive moments.</abstract>
