      <description>Ted Savoie was born in 1943 in Galliano, Louisiana, to a family with
            Acadian heritage (descendants of Fran{cedil}cois Savoie). He spent his childhood living
            with his immediate family and maternal grandfather, who was in the oyster business and a
            community leader. Savoie's father was originally a farmer from Larose, but entered the
            oyster business and then the tugboat business, which Savoie eventually took over. Savoie
            is active in church and civic activities, and the father of four children and many
            grandchildren.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Savoie_Ted_T3935.pdf">Savoie discusses his grandfather's influence on his early years. He explains the
            importance of the Catholic Church in his daily life, growing up, and for his children
            and their families. He talks about the role of music and dance halls in his youth, and
            how he helped to bring musicians to the bayou. Savoie discusses the importance of
            volunteering in the community, including his own role in the development of the Oyster
            Festival. Savoie discusses the various homes he has lived in, and the changing
            demographics of Bayou Lafourche, in terms of religion and race.</abstract>
