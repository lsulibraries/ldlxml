      <description>"Keith ""Cartoonman"" Douglas was born in 1952 in Natchez, Miss. He grew
            up in New Orleans, attended elementary and high school there, and was interested in art
            from an early age. He attended Xavier University in New Orleans where he studied under
            printmaker John Scott. After graduating, he taught art in public schools in New Orleans
            (Alfred C. Priestly High School) and Baton Rouge (McKinley High School and Southeast
            Middle School) for many years. He is a successful artist known for his cartoons and
            caricatures."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/5_social/Douglas_Keith_T3177.pdf">Douglas talks extensively about his creative process and concepts, including his
            cartoon characters, his caricature business, his ideas for children's books and toys,
            and plans for films and TV shows. He recalls weather and sports-related artwork he
            completed for New Orleans broadcasters Hap Glaudi and Bob Breck. Inspired by his
            father's example of turning ideas into money, Douglas is a powerhouse of plans. He
            compares public schools in New Orleans and Baton Rouge and details his approaches to
            teaching art to youth. He discusses artists in the South Baton Rouge community, his
            experiences as an artist there, and his concern over young people's declining
            appreciation of art and music.</abstract>
