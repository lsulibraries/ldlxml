      <description>Elsie Hebert was born in 1925 to Oscar and Iva Mae Boone; she was an only
            child. She attended Monte Sano Elementary School and Baker High School. Hebert received
            a bachelor's degree in journalism from Louisiana State University in 1945 and continued
            her studies there, receiving a master's degree in 1948. After working as a reporter and
            editor for various newspapers and news programs and teaching for several years at
            Nicholls State University, she returned to LSU in 1966. She was hired to teach in the
            English Department and soon became the faculty adviser to the Reveille. She later
            transitioned into a teaching position with the journalism school where she taught for
            thirty-five years. She earned a doctorate from the University of Texas at Austin during
            her first few years as a journalism professor at LSU. She was married to A. Otis Hebert
            and had two sons. Hebert passed away in 2012.</description>
