      <description>Edward Davis attended Catholic High School in Baton Rouge, La. He joined
            the U.S. Navy on July 2, 1942, and served primarily on the USS Kalk in the European and
            Pacific Theaters during World War II. He was awarded the Purple Heart due to an injury
            he suffered when the Kalk was bombed in 1944. After the war, Davis settled in Baton
            Rouge where he attended Louisiana State University, married and had three children. He
            died in 2012 at age eighty-eight.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/military/Davis_Edward.pdf">Davis discusses his service aboard the USS Kalk as a range finder operator and
            gunner's mate from June 1942 through December 1945. His recollections include patrolling
            the Aleutian Islands, escorting convoys to North Africa in preparation for Operation
            Torch, escorting a convoy to Murmansk, Russia, by way of the Panama Canal, and stops in
            Papua, New Guinea. Davis recalls the bombing of the Kalk at Biak Island, the injury he
            sustained in the attack, and his recovery. He recounts steering the ship through a
            deadly typhoon off the Philippines and witnessing Japan's surrender on the deck of the
            USS Missouri. He recalls other highlights from his service, his trip back to Louisiana,
            and after the war.</abstract>
