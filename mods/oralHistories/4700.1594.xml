      <description>Emerson Bell, known for his sculpture, printmaking and painting, was born
            in Baton Rouge, La. Bell attended McKinley High School, the Central Area Vocational
            School, and he studied at the John Payne National College and Charles Wilson Fine Arts
            Academy. He also studied under Alvin Batiste at Southern University. He served in the
            army from 1953 to 1955, and was stationed in Japan and South Korea. Bell received grants
            from the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts and was the first
            artist-in-residence in the Baton Rouge Public School System, where he taught art for
            many years. Bell passed away in 2006 at age 74.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/5_social/Bell_Emerson_T3175.pdf">Bell discusses how his upbringing in South Baton Rouge encouraged him to explore
            the arts, which came naturally to him. He recalls the influence of his arts education by
            family members, friends, and other artists in the community. He describes his early
            works and traces the influence of various artists who instilled in him the values of
            simplicity, sincerity and hard work. He recalls influences and opportunities in New
            Orleans, Chicago, New York, Detroit, Canada and Japan. He expounds on the spiritual
            influences on his work and how he still draws inspiration from his early life
            experiences. Finally, he discusses teaching young artists and urging them to resist
            material interests and build their confidence.</abstract>
