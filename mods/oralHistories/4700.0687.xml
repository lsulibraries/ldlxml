         <description>Daryl Blacher Murray was born on April 2, 1956, in New Orleans, La., to
            Beverly and Harold Blacher, Sr. She is one of five children and grew up across the
            street from McKinley High School in Baton Rouge, La. Murray attended McKinley High
            School from 1970 to 1974. She served as student body president and class president, was
            named Most Popular and Miss Track, and was a member of the Honor Society. After
            graduating from McKinley, she attended Southern University and graduated with a degree
            in speech communication. At the time of the interview, she was employed by the East
            Baton Rouge Parish Planning Commission. She went on to work as the associate state
            director for community outreach for the AARP, and in 2009 became the director of the
            Bureau of Policy, Planning and Evaluation for the Louisiana Department of Social
