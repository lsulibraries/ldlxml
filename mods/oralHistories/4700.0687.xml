   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/1_history/Murray_Daryl_Blacher_T1014.pdf">Murray recalls her time as a student at McKinley High School from 1970 to 1974. She
            discusses the importance of academics, the teachers who were her role models, the
            popular fashions and hairstyles, the elected offices she held and honors she was
            bestowed, and the role that a McKinley education played in her career as a public
            servant. She discusses the role of athletics at McKinley, the quality of the athletic
            programs, and the rivalry between McKinley and Capitol High School. She ponders the
            influence of McKinley on Baton Rouge's history and the school's impact on the political
            life of African Americans in Baton Rouge.</abstract>
