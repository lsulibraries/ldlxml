      <description>Joseph Emile Dupont Jr. was born on February 2, 1922, in Plaquemine, La.
            He graduated from Plaquemine High School in 1940 and joined the U.S. Marine Corps.
            Dupont served in the Pacific Theater during World War II, fighting at the Battle of
            Corregidor where he was taken prisoner by the Japanese in May 1942. He was held captive
            at Cabanatuan, Palawan Island, and Manila in the Philippines until January 1945. After
            returning to the United States, he married Angela Hannon on September 5, 1946. They
            moved back to Plaquemine and had six children. Dupont worked in the Iberville Parish
            Department of Veterans Affairs as a veterans' service officer until retiring in 1980. He
            died in 2005.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/military/Dupont_Joseph_T2037-2042.abs.pdf">"Session I concerns Dupont's early life; his inspiration for joining the Marine
            Corps; boot camp in San Diego; and his passage through Hawaii, Guam, Midway Island, and
            Manila. He talks at length about being stationed in Shanghai in 1941. The interview ends
            with the Japanese attack on Manila, where he was in a hospital, on December 9, 1941.;
            Session II deals with the period between December 1941 and May 1942, during which time
            Dupont served on Corregidor in the Philippines. He describes details of life there while
            under siege by the Japanese, the fighting on Bataan and Corregidor, and his eventually
            being forced to surrender.; In Sessions III &amp; IV, Dupont describes conditions in
            several prison camps in the Philippines, including Bilibid Prison in Manila, the
            hospital at Bilibid Prison, and prison camps in Cabanatuan and Palawan Island. He
            recounts details of hard labor including building an airfield in the jungle on Palawan
            Island, lack of food and clothing, poor shelter, diseases, maltreatment by guards, and
            encounters with wild animals. He describes the Battle of Manila, his subsequent
            liberation from Bilibid Prison, readjusting to life after his freedom, and his
            homecoming to Louisiana. He also discusses the ""hell ships,"" Japanese ships carrying
            American prisoners of war that were sunk unknowingly by American submarines, and the
            massacre of American POWs on Palawan Island on December 14, 1944.; Session V concerns
            the postwar rehabilitation of Dupont and his close friends, all of whom had war-related
            disabilities. He describes his homecoming, meeting and marrying his wife, creating a
            life as a visually impaired veteran, and his work for the Department of Veterans
            Affairs.; In Session VI, Dupont tells of his childhood in Plaquemine in the 1920s and
            1930s, the Mississippi River flood of 1927, his family background, life along the river,
            the Depression, his schooling, activities of teenagers, and joining the
            Marines."</abstract>
