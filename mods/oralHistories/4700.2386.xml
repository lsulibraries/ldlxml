   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/historycoopexten/Eubanks_Gina_T4315.abs.pdf">Eubanks discusses her early life in Clinton, East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. She
            documents her time as a 4-H member during high school and how the extension agents
            genuinely cared for the club members. She also discusses how a job cleaning houses led
            her to earn her B.S. degree from Southern University. She discusses her time as a
            merchandiser for Goudchaux's department store and as an instructor at Alcorn State and
            Virginia Tech universities. Eventually she earned her Ph.D. from Oklahoma State
            University and joined the faculty at Southern University. She illustrates the difference
            between teaching in a college setting and an extension setting. Eubanks describes
            various aspects of extension, from purchasing her first sewing machine through extension
            to the new ability of agents to deliver presentations to community members via
            YouTube.</abstract>
