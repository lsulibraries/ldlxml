      <description>Farris was born in Greenville, Miss. on 1 January 1935 and grew up one of
            six children in nearby Leland. Her father was an attorney and her mother a housewife.
            She followed her father to college at Ole Miss, where she majored in home economics and
            graduated in 1956. She joined the Phi Mu Sorority and after her graduation served one
            year as a field secretary for the society. She went to work in the Dean of Women's
            Office at Ole Miss, where she remained for 10 years before coming to LSU to serve as the
            assistant dean of women, working specifically with Panhellenic, sororities, and sorority
            housing, and other student organizations. She worked for LSU for 20 years before
            retiring in August 1987.</description>
