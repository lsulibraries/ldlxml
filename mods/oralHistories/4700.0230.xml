      <description>Dr. Perkins was born on 27 December 1924 to John E. Perkins, Sr., and
            Velma Valeria Davis Perkins. After serving in World War II, Perkins completed his
            bachelor's degree at Southern University. He also acquired his master's and PhD at
            Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Returning to Baton Rouge in 1951, Perkins
            joined the faculty of Southern University, where he taught music for twenty-seven years.
            In 1978, he accepted a position as assistant vice-chancellor of academic affairs at LSU.
            Perkins continued his connection to LSU as executive assistant to Chancellor Bud Davis
            until 1989, when he also became a professor emeritus of humanities at
            LSU.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_faculty/Perkins_Huel_T332_T333.abs.pdf">The interview includes Perkins's background information, his parents and
            grandparents' experiences and education, and his education and professional life in
            Baton Rouge. Included is a discussion on the role of education in his life and that of
            others, his love of music, role models, and family structure throughout his life.
            Perkins also discusses the immediate changes brought about by integration for black
            colleges, the black community, and the effects of integration today on those same
            institutions.</abstract>
