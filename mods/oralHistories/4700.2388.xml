            Louisiana. He is the son of Armand Bertrand Coreil and Juanita Smith. He grew up in
            Ville Platte, where he attended high school at Sacred Heart Catholic School. In 1976 he
            graduated with a B.S. in zoology from the University of Southwestern Louisiana. He later
            attended Louisiana State University where he received a master's degree in wildlife
            management in 1984 and a Ph.D. in vocational education in 1995. Coreil was involved in
            the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service for most of his career. In 1978 he was hired
            as an assistant area agent for wildlife and fisheries. He also served as Parish Chairman
            of Cameron Parish LCES, associate specialist of wetland and coastal resources in the

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/historycoopexten/Coreil_Paul_T4317.abs.pdf">Coreil begins the interview by discussing his parents, his early farm life, and
            working on a farm as a teenager. He details his job as a student worker studying nutria
            and how that led him to a job with extension services. He describes moving to Cameron
            Parish, establishing a sea-grant extension program, and the challenges he faced while on
            the job. These include the Endangered Species Act of the 1970s, a time when shrimpers
            blockaded a federal ship channel, installing new phone lines in the parish extension
            office, and how the first computers impacted extension. He also details how farmers now
            utilize information on the Internet vs. getting it from county agents, the devastation
            of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and how Louisiana Cooperative Extension played a vital
            role in helping to recover from the storms. He describes what it takes to be successful
            in extension services and discusses the future of the extension model.</abstract>
