      <description>Carolyn Neal Simpson was born on 15 January 1931 in Ardmore, Okla.
            Simpson attended Bartlesville College High School in Oklahoma and completed her freshman
            year of college at Monticello in Alton, Ill. She transferred to the University of Texas,
            pledged Kappa Alpha Theta, and graduated in August 1953. She moved to Baton Rouge in
            February 1953, and taught as a substitute teacher. In 1958, Simpson was elected
            president of the Baton Rouge alumni organization of Kappa Alpha Theta. She helped
            establish a Kappa Alpha Theta colony at LSU and assisted in the building of their house.
            She also held several other local, regional, and national posts in the
            sorority.</description>
