      <description>Billy J. Cochran was born on December 10, 1933, in Darbun, Mississippi.
            He is the son of Arville Alexander Cochran and Gertrude Lewis. He attended rural
            Mississippi schools during his youth. In 1958 he graduated with a B.S. degree in
            agricultural engineering from Mississippi State University. Upon graduation, he served
            for a short time in the United States Army, and then returned to school at Texas A&amp;M
            University. In 1962 he graduated with a master's degree in agricultural engineering. In
            1964 he joined the faculty at Louisiana State University where he taught in the
            Agricultural Engineering Department. During the early seventies, he took a sabbatical
            from LSU and earned a Ph.D. in agricultural engineering from Oklahoma State University.
            After retiring from LSU in 1983, he worked abroad with the International Rice Research
            Institute and the Food and Agriculture Organization in Thailand. From 1992 to 1996 he
            worked for the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service as a solid waste specialist. He
            lives in Baton Rouge, La., with his wife, Jintana.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/historycoopexten/Cochran_Bill_T4318.abs.pdf">Cochran begins the interview by discussing his parents' cotton farm. He also talks
            about life in a rural school and moving to the city of Columbia where he had his first
            job as a paperboy for the New Orleans Item. The interview then moves into a discussion
            about his education at Mississippi State, Texas A&amp;M, and Oklahoma State
            Universities. He documents his time as an LSU professor, an international consultant in
            the field of agriculture, and his time as a solid waste specialist for the Louisiana
            Cooperative Extension Service.</abstract>
