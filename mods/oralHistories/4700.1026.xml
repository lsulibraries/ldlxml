      <description>Dupuy H. Anderson graduated from McKinley High School in Baton Rouge,
            La., in 1935, received a B.S. degree from Southern University in Baton Rouge, and a
            D.D.S. degree from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn. He enlisted in 1941 and
            served with the U.S. Air Force, rising to the rank of major. He participated in the 1953
            Baton Rouge bus boycott and filed suit to desegregate the undergraduate division of
            Louisiana State University. His daughter, Freya Anderson Rivers, was one of six
            African-American undergraduates to integrate LSU in 1964.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/4_boycott/Anderson_Dupuy_T1513.pdf">Dupuy H. Anderson discusses his childhood in a mixed neighborhood and memories of
            public school segregation in Baton Rouge; discrimination and segregation in the U.S. Air
            Force that resulted in his being refused assignments; and his experiences with racism
            and segregation in social gatherings, trains, hospitals, and schools across the South.
            He explains his interest in school desegregation, the motivations and concerns of
            African Americans for desegregation, and his observations of integration in Atlanta,
            Mississippi, and California. Anderson also describes his participation in the Baton
            Rouge bus boycott of 1953, including the leadership of veterans, peoples' providing free
            rides for African-American commuters, and the limited success of the effort.</abstract>
