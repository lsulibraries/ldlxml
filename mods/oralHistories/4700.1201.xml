      <description>John Breaux, a Democrat, U.S. representative (1972-1986), and U.S.
            senator (elected in 1986) from Louisiana, graduated from Louisiana State University Law
            School in 1967. He met Gillis Long in the late 1960s, when Long was running for governor
            and Breaux was working for Edwin Edwards. Gillis Long (1923-1985) was representative for
            the 8th U.S. Congressional District of Louisiana in 1963-1965 and 1973-1985. He ran
            unsuccessfully for governor of Louisiana in 1964 and 1971.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/gillis/Breaux_John.pdf">Part of a series conducted by Gary Huey, the interview was for a biography on
            Gillis Long. Breaux discusses Long's professional career (including his running for
            governor in 1971, his campaigns for Congress, and his service there) and love of
            politics, as well as his effectiveness at fundraising and involvement in the Democratic
            Leadership Council.</abstract>
