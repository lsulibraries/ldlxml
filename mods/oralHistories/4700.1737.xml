      <description>Nona Gray was born in 1916 to Henry Dumouil and Beulah Watson Dumouil.
            She grew up in Beauregard Town, a neighborhood just south of downtown Baton Rouge. Gray
            attended Reddy Street School and graduated from McKinley High School in 1932. She
            received her undergraduate degree from Southern University in 1936, and completed her
            Master's Degree in Education at Louisiana State University in 1954. At the time she
            attended LSU, she was one of only four African-Americans in the graduate school. Gray
            married in 1947 and taught at Perkins Road School, McKinley High and Valley Park School
            until her retirement in 1977.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/5_social/Gray_Nona_T3439.pdf">Gray discusses growing up in Beauregard Town, a racially-mixed neighborhood, in the
            1920s, 30s and 40s. She lists her family members who all lived on the same block that
            her grandfather, Levanski, had purchased from a French family. She recalls the geography
            of the neighborhood and surrounding areas: downtown Baton Rouge, the riverfront, Catfish
            Town, and South Baton Rouge. She talks about stores, restaurants, theaters, churches and
            businesses in the area. She recounts her time at Reddy Street School and McKinley High,
            and her experience as one of the first African American graduate students at LSU in the
            1950s. She discusses race relations in Beauregard Town and Baton Rouge in the 1920s
            through 1950s.</abstract>
