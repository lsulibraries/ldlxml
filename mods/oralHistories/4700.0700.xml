   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/2_businesses/Earthly_Barbara_T1027.pdf">Earthly grew up in the vicinity of East Boulevard in South Baton Rouge. She talks
            about the doctors' offices, grocery and dry goods stores, and clothing stores in the
            neighborhood. She recalls a decline in local businesses as the business owners passed
            away, as supermarkets emerged, as integration contributed to flight, and as businesses
            were sold, closed, or burned down. She reflects on the difference between the close
            family businesses of the past and the impersonal shop-n-go places of today.</abstract>
