      <description>Eva Legard was born in Lafayette, La., in 1924, and moved to Baton Rouge
            in 1938. A 1942 graduate of McKinley High School, she worked for many years at Southern
            University, retiring from the registrar's office. She was the first African American
            female member of the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board. Active in promoting public
            education, she worked with the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, and with her church, St.
            Francis Xavier. Legard was a longtime member and president of the Board of the Baton
            Rouge Council on Human Relations. In 1986, she received their Powell-Reznikoff
            Humanitarian Award. She died in 2005 at age eighty.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/1_history/Legard_Eva_T908.pdf">Legard talks about her years at McKinley High School (1938-1942), and the changes
            she's seen in schools and education. She discusses her favorite classes and teachers,
            fellow students, discipline, teachers' involvement in students' lives, and the role of
            academics and athletics. She briefly touches on the Civil Rights Movement and her
            election to and service on the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board.</abstract>
