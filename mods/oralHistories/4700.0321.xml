      <description>Johnnie Jones, Sr. was born in Laurel Hill, La., in 1919. After
            completing sixth grade, he worked for Ransom Lumber Company in Woodville, Miss., where
            he lived with his boss, Mr. Hergen, and tutored Hergen's son, Buddy. Jones later was
            sent to live with his uncle in Scotlandville, La., to begin his high school education at
            Southern University Demonstration School. He went on to Southern University for a year
            and a half until he was drafted into the U.S. Army to serve in World War II. He was one
            of the first African-American warrant officers and he took part in the D-Day invasion,
            landing in the third wave at Omaha Beach. After the war, Jones returned to Southern
            University to finish his bachelor's degree in psychology. After graduating, he married
            Sebell Chase and worked for two years at the post office. He then went on to Southern
            University Law School and earned his law degree in 1953. Jones' legal career included
            several landmark civil rights cases.</description>
