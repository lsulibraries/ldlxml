      <description>Ida Belle Joshua is a native of New Orleans, La., and survivor of
            Hurricane Betsy. She moved to the Ninth Ward in 1949 with her husband, Isaac Joshua Sr.
            They have three children. Before Hurricane Betsy, she worked as a hair dresser. After
            the storm, she attended the University of New Orleans, Atlanta University (now Clark
            Atlanta University), and Tulane University and worked as a teacher's aide, social
            worker, and adjunct professor at Xavier University. She is a former president of the
            Lower Ninth Ward Neighborhood Council and Area Beautification Committee and has been an
            advocate for improvement of the Ninth Ward community. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005,
            she temporarily relocated to Lafayette, La. She intended to return to her home and had
            begun having it repaired before it was demolished. She and several other residents sued
            the city of New Orleans and achieved their goal of preventing the city from demolishing
            homes without proper notification and hearings for homeowners.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/hurricanebetsy/Joshua_IdaBelle_T3336.abs.pdf">Ida Belle Joshua tells of arriving in the Ninth Ward neighborhood in 1949 and
            watching it develop as a community. She described the community as African Americans
            working in civil service positions with dreams and hopes for the future. Joshua provides
            details of Hurricane Betsy's devastation, rescue efforts, federal assistance, and
            community activism. She gives her opinion on what should have been done differently
            following Hurricane Betsy and discusses the recent deterioration of the community
            because of the lack of activism and community effort.</abstract>
