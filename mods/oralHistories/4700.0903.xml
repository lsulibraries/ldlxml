      <description>Robert C. West (1913-2001) received bachelor's and master's degrees from
            the University of California, Los Angeles, finishing in 1938. He entered the Ph.D.
            program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied under the prominent
            geographer, Carl Sauer. West served as a cartographer in the Office of Strategic
            Services, a forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency, for four years during World
            War II. After the war, he quickly completed his dissertation on colonial mining in
            Northern Mexico, receiving his Ph.D. in 1946. West worked as a cultural geographer with
            the Smithsonian Institution in Mexico City for two years before joining the faculty of
            the Department of Geography and Anthropology at Louisiana State University in 1948,
            specifically teaching courses on Central and South America. He was named a Boyd
            Professor in 1970 and retired in 1980.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_faculty/West_Robert_alltapes.abs.pdf">Session I, which is indexed, concerns West's education under Carl Sauer at the
            University of California, Berkeley; his decision to study geography at the University of
            California, Los Angeles; his work with Clifford Zierer at UCLA; and his interest in the
            geography of Mexico.; Session II, which is indexed, covers West's work with Carl Sauer,
            his thesis on Spanish settlement in Mexico near silver mines, his time making maps and
            surveying European map collections for the Office of Strategic Services during World War
            II, his study of the Tarascan Indians of Mexico for the Smithsonian Institution, his
            interest in chinampas farming and related work with Pedro Armillas, and various
            approaches and theories in the study of geography.; Session III, which is transcribed,
            describes Carl Sauer and Alfred Kroeber at Berkeley, West's arrival at Louisiana State
            University, and topics in the study of geography.; Session IV, which is transcribed,
            concerns West's research on salt marshes in South America, French and Spanish surnames
            in Louisiana, agriculture in Mexico and South America, and theories on overpopulation in
            pre-Columbian Mexico.; Session V, which is transcribed, describes West's research on
            vegetation in the Mexican state of Tabasco, cacao plantations around Comalcalco,
            colleagues he worked with in Mexico and their research interests, interviewing locals in
            Mexico on agricultural practices, and his own methods for doing field work.; Session VI,
            which is indexed, concerns West's methods for doing field work, especially his use of
            photography, and changes in crops, chinampas farming, and agricultural methods in
            Mexico.; Session VII, which is indexed, discusses West's work on the geography of the
            Mexican state of Sonora, faculty members in LSU's Department of Geography and
            Anthropology, some of West's former students and their research, and a summation of
            West's research methods.</abstract>
