      <description>Clyde Orgeron, b. 1947, is a Valentine, Louisiana native, the son of
            Augustin Fortunate Orgeron and Nola Barrilleaux Orgeron, who were farmers. After
            graduating from public high school in 1966, he worked for Freeport Sulphur Company in
            Port Sulphur, Louisiana, and was then transferred to a rig off of Grand Isle, Louisiana.
            He studied electrical engineering through home correspondence, and was transferred to
            the electrical and instrumentation department; he stayed with Freeport Sulphur fourteen
            years, until the company closed. He took a position with the Louisiana Offshore Oil
            Port. Orgeron married in 1968; he and his wife had two children. He is a practicing
            Catholic. In his retirement he lives in Cut Off, Louisiana, and Magnolia,
            Mississippi.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Orgeron_Clyde_T3933.pdf">"Orgeron discusses his childhood, growing up on a farm in Valentine, Louisiana. He
            recounts his early career at the Freeport Sulphur Company, which eventually moved him
            from Port Sulphur, Louisiana, to a 7/7 schedule on an offshore rig closer to Bayou
            Lafourche. He took correspondence courses and advanced in the company; during his time
            on land he and his wife were busy building a new home and starting a family. Orgeron
            discusses how he came to work for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port [LOOP]. He shares his
            religious beliefs; as a practicing Catholic he goes to church every Sunday and is
            involved in religious service groups. He discusses life on the bayou, both in regards to
            flooding, how things were when he was a boy, and what has changed. Orgeron sings the
            Cajun song ""Allons Danser Colinda"" and discusses his recent trip to Nova Scotia and
            his connection with the people there."</abstract>
