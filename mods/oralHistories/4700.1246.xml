      <description>Jimmie H. Hoover was born in Board Camp, Ark., in 1930. He attended the
            College of the Ozarks for a year, then graduated from Arkansas Polytechnic College in
            1952. Hoover served in the 34th Radio Squadron Mobile in Libya during the Korean War.
            After his stint in the Air Force, Hoover started his master's study in library science
            at Louisiana State University, finishing his M.S. degree in 1958. He worked in a
            succession of positions at the LSU-Baton Rouge and LSU-New Orleans libraries, including
            heading the Business Administration and Government Documents departments from 1968 until
            his retirement from LSU in 1984. After retiring, he worked with the East Baton Rouge
            Parish Library and at the Centroplex Library. He was married to Lillian Fitzgerald
            Hoover for forty years. He died on April 1, 2000, at age 69.</description>
