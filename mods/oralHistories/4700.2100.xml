      <description>Brenda Dardar Robichaux was born and raised in a Houma Indian community
            just south of the corporation limits of Golden Meadow, Louisiana. Her grandfather,
            Ernest Dardar, was a traiteur, or healer, and her father was a fisherman. The youngest
            child in her family, she was among the first Indian students to integrate Bayou
            Lafourche public schools, and she worked for the parish school district early in her
            career. She served as the Principal Chief of the United Houma Nation (1997-2010), and is
            an outspoken advocate for minority rights. She has also served on numerous boards
            (Second Harvest, Inter-Tribal Council of Louisiana, National Indian Education
            Association, Rockefeller Philanthropy Gulf Coast Ecological Health and Community Renewal
            Fund Advisory Group, New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage) and has won many awards for her
            service from local and national organizations (Times Picayune, Ms. Foundation, National
            Coalition on Black Civic Participation, United Houma Nation). She is married to former
            state senator Michael Robichaux and has three children: Josh, Jason, and
            Felicite.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Robichaux_Brenda_T3946.pdf">Robichaux discusses her upbringing in a Houma community just outside of Golden
            Meadow, Louisiana, and the history of the contentious relationship between the Houma and
            the white communities of south Louisiana. The family grew much of its own food, and her
            father always made sure the family was well fed, even during economically challenging
            times. Robichaux discusses the changes in Bayou Lafourche, including the saltwater
            erosion and the rise in industry in formerly residential communities. She discusses her
            grandfather's (Ernest Dardar, a traiteur) role in the community, and recounts the
            gathering spaces for the family and community, which included the Catholic chapel, her
            father's boat, and her parents' house.</abstract>
