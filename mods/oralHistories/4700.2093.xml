      <description>"Augustin ""A.J."" LeBlanc, was born July 9, 1936, in Lockport,
            Louisiana, and is one of three sons of Augustin LeBlanc, Sr. He grew up speaking French
            at home, and his house did not have electricity until after World War II. He was raised,
            and continues to be, an observant Catholic, and education was always emphasized by his
            parents. After high school he married and began working for Humble Oil (now Exxon), but
            left in 1958 to study insurance marketing at University of Southwest Louisiana. He set
            up a State Farm-affiliated practice in Larose, which grew to be very successful. He and
            his wife have four children and a number of grandchildren, live in Larose and have a
            camp in Leeville."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/LeBlanc_Augustin_J_T3939.pdf">LeBlanc discusses his French Catholic upbringing, and the importance of community,
            family, and education in his youth. He talks about his early marriage and career with
            Humble Oil, and about switching careers into the nascent insurance industry, in which he
            had financial and professional success. He discusses the physical and socioeconomic
            topography of Bayou Lafourche, talking about its changes over the past sixty years, and
            its current physical reduction and financial inequalities. He talks about the impact of
            hurricanes on Bayou Lafourche. He discusses his family history and his offspring. He
            mentions his participation in a community of local French speakers who are trying to
            preserve the language, and the importance of doing so.</abstract>
