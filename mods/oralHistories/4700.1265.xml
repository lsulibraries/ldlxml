      <description>"Harold V. Anderson was born in 1907 outside of Cumberland, Iowa. His
            father, Perry, a cattle buyer, and mother, Pauline, moved the family to Yuma, Colorado,
            around 1910. Andersen started high school in Yuma in 1921 and graduated in 1925. He
            attended the University of Denver for one year on a scholarship, but could not afford to
            continue his studies there. Throughout the 1920s and '30s, Andersen continued his
            education at various institutions (when funding allowed) and held multiple jobs, working
            as a carpenter, lab supervisor, and field archaeologist to name a few. While working in
            a coal mine in Utah in 1927, he lost half of his thumb in an accident. He earned a B.A.
            in Geology from the University of Nebraska in 1940 and soon took a job with the Alabama
            Geological Survey. He enlisted in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II in
            1942 and served briefly in Europe. His engineering unit was sent back to California to
            train for the invasion of Japan, but the war ended before they were deployed. He was
            discharged in 1946 after achieving the rank of captain. A visit to Louisiana State
            University that same year led to a graduate assistantship in their burgeoning Geology
            Department. His dissertation research, completed in tandem with another student, James
            Morgan, focused on a foraminiferal assemblage found in mud lump clays from the
            Mississippi River. In 1950, four months after receiving his Ph.D., he was recalled to
            military duty during the Korean War. He spent the next two years working on a technical
            manual called ""Geology and Its Military Application."" After his service, he returned
            to teaching at LSU and retired in 1977 as Professor Emeritus of the Geology and
            Geophysics Department. Andersen passed away on June 28, 2000 at age
            92."</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_faculty/Andersen_Harold_T1846-1848.abs.pdf">Anderson discusses his early years in Yuma, Colorado and how fossil hunting with
            his father, Perry, in northeastern Colorado developed his interest in geology and
            paleontology. He discusses how the Andersen paleoindian artifact collection was amassed,
            why it was important, and how it created associations with museums and curators. He
            traces his piecemeal education at the University of Denver, University of Nebraska, LSU,
            and other institutions and recalls influential professors who shaped his studies and
            assisted him in finding employment. He describes fieldwork in Colorado, Nebraska,
            Alabama, and Louisiana, and other jobs he held including coal miner, carpenter, and
            archaeological lab supervisor. Andersen discusses how he came to study and later teach
            at LSU in the Geology Department and the faculty members in the department in the late
            1940s and early 1950s. He recalls his most significant find: a stunning array of
            microfossils preserved in mud lump clays collected from the mouth of the Mississippi
            River with another student, James Morgan. He talks about exhibits he installed and
            improvements he spearheaded in the Geology building [now known as the Howe-Russell
            Geoscience Complex.] He describes his close friendship with a Romanian professor,
            Theodor Neagu, and his son, Mike. Andersen touches on many other topics in this dense
            interview.</abstract>
