      <description>John J. McKeithen was born in Grayson, Caldwell Parish, La., in May 1918.
            He graduated from LSU in 1940 and LSU Law School in 1942. McKeithen married Marjorie
            Funderburk in 1942 and they had six children, including son Fox, who followed his father
            into a life of politics. John McKeithen was elected to the Louisiana House of
            Representatives and served as floor leader under Gov. Earl Long in 1947. He was elected
            governor himself in 1963, running as a segregationist Democrat, and served two
            consecutive terms in this office until 1972. McKeithen was appointed to the LSU Board of
            Supervisors in 1981 by then Gov. Dave Treen. John J. McKeithen died in June 1999 at the
            age of 81.</description>
