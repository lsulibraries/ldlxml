      <description>Ferguson was born on 18 May 1922 in Shreveport, La. Her father was a
            stockbroker and her mother a homemaker. She married John Ferguson. She attended
            Centenary College for two years, majoring in history and minoring in English, before
            completing her B.S. at LSU. Ferguson was instrumental in bringing the Zeta Tau Alpha
            Society to LSU, and she played an integral part in the building of their sorority house.
            Ferguson also served as Panhellenic director for LSU in the late 1940s and as president
            of the Zeta Tau Alpha House Corporation Board in the 1960s.</description>
