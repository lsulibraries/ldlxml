   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/religion/Wood_Charles_T114_T161_T162.abs.pdf">Wood discusses his family and educational background. He recounts his decision to
            become a minister and the student activism at LSU in the 1970s, including his reasons
            for supporting student protesters. Wood also reminisces about his work as a counselor at
            the medical health center, incidents he has dealt with throughout his career, and his
            duties as pastor of St. Albans, including his day-to-day routine.</abstract>
