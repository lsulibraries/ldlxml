      <description>Ophelia Lefort was born in the late 1920s in Galliano, Louisiana, and
            raised in the 1930s. She attended Cut Off High School in the 1940s, and worked at a
            shrimp shed. Her first boyfriend was Pershing Lefort (circa 1924-2003), whom she met at
            the Galliano movie theater; they were engaged before World War II, and married after the
            war. The Leforts moved to Lafayette for her husband's education, then returned to Bayou
            Lafourche, where they raised four children and he worked in the oil industry. After the
            youngest of their children was in school, Lefort became a middle school secretary, and
            began painting in 1985. Lefort is an accomplished amateur painter, depicting scenes of
            bayou life on unusual surfaces (oyster shells, cypress shingles, etc.). She and her late
            husband bought and preserved a former teacher boarding house in Larose, Louisiana, where
            she still resides.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/bayoulafourche/Lefort_Ophelia_T3944.pdf">Lefort discusses her childhood on the bayou, including attending a two-room
            schoolhouse, attending church, trapping with her father, and working at a shrimp shed
            during World War II. She recalls meeting her husband in a local movie theater, and
            discusses her family's genealogical roots. She tells how she acquired her current
            residence, which is a converted boarding house for Bayou Lafourche educators, and
            discusses the motivations and practices she uses in her painting.</abstract>
