      <description>Virginia Hamilton Vercher was born in York County near Fort Mill, South
            Carolina, on January 8, 1922. She attended high school and two years of college, then
            worked for six years at Duke Power Company. She moved to Louisiana with her husband, a
            Shreveport native who worked for Ethyl Corporation in Baton Rouge. She worked for the
            Louisiana State Department of Revenue for four years, and after becoming pregnant, spent
            the next six years as a stay-at-home mom. She started working for Louisiana State
            University in 1962 as a secretary to Dr. James Upp, Director of Agriculture Experiment
            Stations, and she continued to work for Upp's successor, Doyle Chambers. She became the
            secretary to Chancellor Cecil Taylor in 1966, and shortly thereafter, was asked by
            Bernard Sliger to set up a Personnel Services office at LSU's Baton Rouge campus.
            Vercher retired as Associate Director of Personnel Services in 1983. She passed away in
            1997.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_faculty/Vercher_Virginia_T260_T352_T353.pdf">Vercher recalls her experiences working in various administrative secretarial
            positions and the Personnel Services office at LSU in the 1960s though 1980s. Prompted
            by Besch, who also often shares his opinions, Vercher offers personal impressions and
            memories of various administrators, deans, and professors at LSU. She describes the
            development of the Personnel Services office and her role as the founding employee. She
            recalls the roles and duties of key campus administrators including Cecil Taylor,
            Bernard Sliger, Paul Murrill, Lynn Pesson and James Reddoch among others. Vercher goes
            into detail on university policies and procedures on tenure, academic and non-academic
            appointments, classified and unclassified positions, job titles, salary levels,
            personnel forms, biographical data on employees, and many other topics.</abstract>
