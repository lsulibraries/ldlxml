   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/ole_war_skule/Williams_Aubrey_T1279_T1280.abs.pdf">Williams discusses his experiences attending Louisiana State University including
            his time spent studying journalism and working for the Morning Advocate; studying in the
            English Department; student and fraternity life; military training; the Southern Review
            and The Reveille; various faculty members; and anecdotes about Cleanth Brooks, Robert
            Penn Warren, Katherine Anne Porter, and John J. Tigert. He describes his service in the
            Army during World War II, including witnessing the Nuremberg Trials. Williams discusses
            his attendance at Yale University including studying under Maynard Mack, teaching
            courses, and spending a year on fellowship in England. He also discusses his teaching at
            the University of Florida including the Johns Committee, the pressures of affirmative
            action, the poor quality of its English students, the saga of Council Bly, and English
            Department politics.</abstract>
