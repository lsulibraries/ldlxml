      <description>Denver Loupe was born in 1927 in Gonzales, Louisiana, to Jack Loupe and
            Linda Gaudin. He grew up on a farm in the Burnside community of Gonzales. During school
            he was a member of 4-H and Future Farmers of America. He served as the first president
            of the Ascension Parish 4-H Executive Committee. He attended Northwestern State
            University for a year before entering the U.S. Navy. After returning from the navy,
            Loupe returned to Northwestern State University for two more years before transferring
            to Louisiana State University. He graduated from LSU with a degree in agriculture before
            earning a master's degree and doctorate, also from LSU. The doctorate is in botany and
            plant pathology. After earning his doctorate, he taught high school for three years in
            Ascension Parish. Later he became an extension agent in St. James Parish. He also served
            as a sugarcane specialist in St. James Parish from 1954 to 1978. During his time as a
            sugarcane specialist he served as superintendent of the 4-H Plant Science Contest.
            Beginning in 1972, Loupe headed the Plant Science Division of the Louisiana Extension
            Program. In 1978 he was selected as director of Louisiana Cooperative Extension
            Services. In the same year he established the Louisiana 4-H Foundation. He has served on
            the National 4-H Council Board of Directors and as secretary-treasurer of the American
            Society of Sugarcane Technologies. He has authored numerous
            publications.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/historycoopexten/Loupe_Denver_T4312_T4313.abs.pdf">Loupe provides a biography of his life, documenting his membership in 4-H and
            Future Farmers of America during his school years, his service in the U.S. Navy,
            graduation from Louisiana State University, and his service in the Louisiana Cooperative
            Extension Service. The primary focus of the interview is Loupe's time in extension
            services. He discusses his philosophy of education as an agent, field days and other
            extension demonstrations, livestock shows and contests, and the changing technology in
            the agricultural industry over time.</abstract>
