      <description>Kenneth Roberts was born on September 19, 1944, in New Orleans,
            Louisiana. He is the son of well-known meteorologist Nash C. Roberts and Lydia Leblanc.
            He grew up in Metairie, Louisiana. He attended public schools and participated in the
            4-H club in high school. He started his academic career at the University of New Orleans
            before transferring to Louisiana State University where he earned his bachelor's and
            master's degrees in agricultural economics. After receiving his master's degree, Roberts
            moved to Oregon where he attended Oregon State University. His Ph.D. is in natural
            resource economics. Upon graduation from OSU, Roberts worked as a natural resource
            economist and program director for the Clemson University Sea Grant program. He then
            spent a year working for the National Sea Grant office as a program monitor before
            returning to South Carolina. In 1978, Roberts returned to Louisiana as a Marine
            Extension resource economist for Louisiana Sea Grant. In 2001, he became the associate
            vice chancellor and associate director of Extension for the Louisiana State University
            Ag Center. He retired from the LSU Ag Center in the fall of 2006.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/historycoopexten/Roberts_Kenneth_T4314.abs.pdf">Roberts discusses his father's career as a meteorologist for the major television
            networks. He also provides insight into his 4-H club member days and his schooling,
            particularly his time at the University of New Orleans and his doctoral work at Oregon
            State University. He primarily focuses on his career with Sea Grant, documenting his
            time with Clemson University, the National Sea Grant program, and then as a marine
            economist for Louisiana Sea Grant. Roberts gives insight into the revolutionary nature
            of his split research and extension appointment, how technology and personal computers
            impacted extension work, racial tensions with Vietnamese and Cambodian fishermen, and
            the relationship between the oil industry and Louisiana fisheries. He also describes how
            the fishing industry is traditionally a male-dominated industry; the prevailing theme of
            wages among fishermen; and the political impact of federal, state, and local money in
            extension. Roberts then discusses the need for the quality control of information within
            the extension model.</abstract>
