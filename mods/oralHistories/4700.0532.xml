   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/political/Gremillion_Jack_alltapes.abs.pdf">Gremillion discusses his family, his attendance at LSU, the start of his legal
            practice, his infantry service in France during World War II, and his association with
            the American Legion. Gremillion primarily describes his political career, including his
            work as campaign manager for James A. Noe, running for attorney general, campaigning
            with Earl Long, his role in the Tidelands case, segregation in Louisiana and the related
            legal cases the attorney general's office handled, and voter discrimination. He also
            discusses his memories of several Louisiana political figures, including Earl Long,
            James A. Noe, Jimmie Davis, John McKeithen, Leander Perez, and A.P. Tureaud.</abstract>
