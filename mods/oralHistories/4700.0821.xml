      <description>General O. B. Johnson served as a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps in
            Europe during World War II. He supervised the development of advanced fighter aircraft
            and their implementation during the Korean War. He later commanded the Washington Area
            Air Defense Sector, the 14th Aero Space Force, and the 313th Air Division. After
            retiring from the Air Force in 1973, Johnson served in several positions in the
            Shreveport city government and as undersecretary of public safety under the Treen
            administration.</description>
