   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/2_businesses/Cooper_Herman_T1026.pdf">Cooper primarily discusses African-American owned businesses in South Baton Rouge
            in the 1940s-1960s, describing in detail the locations of business, churches, funeral
            homes and well-known landmarks in the neighborhood. He talks about gravel roads,
            changing street names, former locations of still-operating business and the demolition
            of buildings. He discusses the decline of black-owned businesses in South Baton Rouge
            and his frustration over black-on-black crime. He describes segregated medical care at
            Baton Rouge General Hospital and an ambulance service (operated by his employer,
            Desselle Funeral Home) that took patients to and from Charity Hospital in New Orleans.
            He also discusses funeral homes in Baton Rouge, especially those for African
            Americans.</abstract>
