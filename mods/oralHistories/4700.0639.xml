      <description>Wilbur Joffrion was born on November 8, 1924, in Alexandria, La. His
            parents, A. Bush Joffrion and Clara Hope Flower, were also native Louisianians. He
            attended Louisiana State University, like many in his family, for three semesters
            (1942-1943) and studied chemical engineering. During that time, he served as a ROTC
            company commander. Joffrion was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. In
            1943, Joffrion entered West Point and was graduated in 1946. He married Beebe Grace in
            1951 and together they had four children. Joffrion obtained a master's degree in
            education with a minor in political science from Tulane University in 1953. He then
            taught at West Point. During his eleven years of active duty, Joffrion was stationed in
            Germany and Korea. In 1958, he entered the insurance business and transferred to the
            U.S. Army Reserve. As a reservist, he was assigned to Baton Rouge, Little Rock, and New
            Orleans, and he retired 1981 as a brigadier general.</description>

            War II. He recounts his experience and opinion of West Point as a student, his teaching
            career there, and his later military service in Germany and Korea.</abstract>
