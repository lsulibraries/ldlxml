      <description>Adolph Jerome Byrd was born January 22, 1922, in Shreveport, La. He
            attended McKinley High School in Baton Rouge, La., from 1935 to 1942, often dropping out
            to work and support himself financially. Byrd attended Louisiana Negro Normal and
            Industrial School (now Grambling State University) beginning in 1942, but left to serve
            in World War II. He returned there after the war and earned a degree in elementary
            education in 1949. Byrd later completed master and doctoral degrees and taught in
            Louisiana for over 30 years.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/1_history/Byrd_Adolph_T915.pdf">Byrd discusses his attendance at McKinley High School, including academics, sports,
            activities, influential teachers, older students, and graduates; his struggle to
            complete high school because of the need to drop out for work; the role of the community
            in raising children; disciplinary action he and other children received when they
            misbehaved; the lack of discipline and respect among young people today; and the need to
            rehabilitate nonviolent criminals.</abstract>
