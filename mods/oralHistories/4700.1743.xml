      <description>Ray Roy was born in 1931, the youngest of seven children. His parents
            were Joseph Thomas Roy and Lula Marie Major. He attended Saint Anthony grade school and
            Catholic High School, graduating in 1948. He attended Louisiana State University for two
            years, then joined the U.S. Navy for four years and served in the Korean War. After he
            left the service in 1954, he worked with his brother, Alvin, in his gym on Oklahoma
            Street in Baton Rouge. Alvin was an internationally known weight lifting and strength
            trainer. Ray Roy married his wife Glenda in 1962.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/5_social/Roy_Ray_T3445.pdf">Ray Roy provides biographical details on his experiences growing up in Baton Rouge
            and speaks at length about his older brother Alvin. Ray discusses Alvin's purchase of
            the gym (Alvin Roy's Slenderizing Salon and Turkish Baths), the years that he and Alvin
            worked in the gym together (mid 1950s through late 70s), the struggles of keeping the
            business afloat, descriptions of the gym and surrounding neighborhood, the prominent
            sports figures who trained there, Alvin's work setting up weight training programs for
            multiple pro football teams, and Alvin's family. There is also a discussion of football
            teams and rivalries in the Baton Rouge area prior to integration.</abstract>
