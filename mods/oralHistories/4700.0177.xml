   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/university/distinguished_faculty/Teddlie_Charles_T243.abs.pdf">Teddlie discusses his early political activity, his family background, childhood,
            and high school life and teachers. He reviews his decision to attend college, his
            interest in psychology, and his campus experiences, particularly with ROTC. Teddlie also
            discusses his decision to attend graduate school and his activities as vice-president of
            the Progressive Student's Alliance (PSA) from 1971-72. Finally, he recounts his memories
            of David Duke, other students, and a few members of the LSU administration.</abstract>
