   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/1_history/Chrisentery_Frankie_T1012.abs.pdf">Chrisentery primarily discusses her memories as a student at McKinley High School
            in the early 1940s. She recalls her favorite teachers, school principals, fellow
            students, clothing and hair styles, academics, extracurricular activities, shortcomings
            of the school facilities in the 1940s, and other topics. She discusses some of the
            prominent graduates and the need to keep the legacy of McKinley High alive. She offers
            advice to McKinley graduates and contrasts their opportunities against the limited
            opportunities she faced as a graduate.</abstract>
