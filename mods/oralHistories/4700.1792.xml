      <description>Huel D. Perkins was born in 1924 to John E. Perkins, Sr., and Velma
            Valeria Davis Perkins in Baton Rouge, La. He attended Southern University Laboratory
            School for elementary and high school, graduating in 1940. He attended Southern
            University for three years until he enlisted with the U.S. Navy to serve in World War
            II. After the war, Perkins completed his bachelor's degree at Southern University and
            went on to receive a master's and Ph.D. from Northwestern University. Perkins eventually
            returned to Baton Rouge and joined the faculty of Southern University where he taught
            music for twenty-seven years. In 1978, he accepted a position as assistant vice
            chancellor of academic affairs at Louisiana State University. Perkins continued his
            connection to LSU as executive assistant to Chancellor Bud Davis until 1989, when he
            also became a professor emeritus of humanities at LSU.</description>

   <abstract xlink:href="http://lib.lsu.edu/services/oralhistory/abstracts/mckinley/5_social/Perkins_Huel_T3516.pdf">Perkins discusses his education and goes into some detail on his family history. He
            discusses the educational opportunities available to African-American students in the
            Baton Rouge area in the 1930s and 1940s, including McKinley High and the three
            elementary schools for African-American children. He describes activities and sports he
            took part in in the community and through his church and school. He discusses some of
            the prominent leaders in the Baton Rouge African-American community. Perkins also
            discusses segregation, racism, African-American fraternities, and civil rights
            activism.</abstract>
